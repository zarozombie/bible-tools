{The Book of Tobit   

{1:1} The book of the words of Tobit, son of Tobiel, the son ofAnaniel, the son of Aduel, the son of Gabael, of the seed of Asael, ofthe tribe of Nephthali;   

{1:2} Who in the time of Enemessar king of the Assyrians was ledcaptive out of Thisbe, which is at the right hand of that city, whichis called properly Nephthali in Galilee above Aser.   

{1:3} I Tobit have walked all the days of my life in the ways oftruth and justice, and I did many almsdeeds to my brethren, and mynation, who came with me to Nineve, into the land of the Assyrians.   

{1:4} And when I was in mine own country, in the land of Israelbeing but young, all the tribe of Nephthali my father fell from thehouse of Jerusalem, which was chosen out of all the tribes of Israel,that all the tribes should sacrifice there, where the temple of thehabitation of the most High was consecrated and built for all ages.   

{1:5} Now all the tribes which together revolted, and the house ofmy father Nephthali, sacrificed unto the heifer Baal.   

{1:6} But I alone went often to Jerusalem at the feasts, as it wasordained unto all the people of Israel by an everlasting decree, havingthe firstfruits and tenths of increase, with that which was firstshorn; and them gave I at the altar to the priests the children ofAaron.   

{1:7} The first tenth part of all increase I gave to the sons ofAaron, who ministered at Jerusalem: another tenth part I sold away, andwent, and spent it every year at Jerusalem:   

{1:8} And the third I gave unto them to whom it was meet, as Deboramy father's mother had commanded me, because I was left an orphan by myfather.   

{1:9} Furthermore, when I was come to the age of a man, I marriedAnna of mine own kindred, and of her I begat Tobias.   

{1:10} And when we were carried away captives to Nineve, all mybrethren and those that were of my kindred did eat of the bread of theGentiles.   

{1:11} But I kept myself from eating;   

{1:12} Because I remembered God with all my heart.   

{1:13} And the most High gave me grace and favour before Enemessar,so that I was his purveyor.   

{1:14} And I went into Media, and left in trust with Gabael, thebrother of Gabrias, at Rages a city of Media ten talents of silver.   

{1:15} Now when Enemessar was dead, Sennacherib his son reigned inhis stead; whose estate was troubled, that I could not go into Media.   

{1:16} And in the time of Enemessar I gave many alms to my brethren,and gave my bread to the hungry,   

{1:17} And my clothes to the naked: and if I saw any of my nationdead, or cast about the walls of Nineve, I buried him.   

{1:18} And if the king Sennacherib had slain any, when he was come,and fled from Judea, I buried them privily; for in his wrath he killedmany; but the bodies were not found, when they were sought for of theking.   

{1:19} And when one of the Ninevites went and complained of me tothe king, that I buried them, and hid myself; understanding that I wassought for to be put to death, I withdrew myself for fear.   

{1:20} Then all my goods were forcibly taken away, neither was thereany thing left me, beside my wife Anna and my son Tobias.   

{1:21} And there passed not five and fifty days, before two of hissons killed him, and they fled into the mountains of Ararath; andSarchedonus his son reigned in his stead; who appointed over hisfather's accounts, and over all his affairs, Achiacharus my brotherAnael's son.   

{1:22} And Achiacharus intreating for me, I returned to Nineve. NowAchiacharus was cupbearer, and keeper of the signet, and steward, andoverseer of the accounts: and Sarchedonus appointed him next unto him:and he was my brother's son.   

{2:1} Now when I was come home again, and my wife Anna was restoredunto me, with my son Tobias, in the feast of Pentecost, which is theholy feast of the seven weeks, there was a good dinner prepared me, inthe which I sat down to eat.   

{2:2} And when I saw abundance of meat, I said to my son, Go andbring what poor man soever thou shalt find out of our brethren, who ismindful of the Lord; and, lo, I tarry for thee.   

{2:3} But he came again, and said, Father, one of our nation isstrangled, and is cast out in the marketplace.   

{2:4} Then before I had tasted of any meat, I started up, and tookhim up into a room until the going down of the sun.   

{2:5} Then I returned, and washed myself, and ate my meat inheaviness,   

{2:6} Remembering that prophecy of Amos, as he said, Your feastsshall be turned into mourning, and all your mirth into lamentation.   

{2:7} Therefore I wept: and after the going down of the sun I wentand made a grave, and buried him.   

{2:8} But my neighbours mocked me, and said, This man is not yetafraid to be put to death for this matter: who fled away; and yet, lo,he burieth the dead again.   

{2:9} The same night also I returned from the burial, and slept bythe wall of my courtyard, being polluted and my face was uncovered:   

{2:10} And I knew not that there were sparrows in the wall, and mineeyes being open, the sparrows muted warm dung into mine eyes, and awhiteness came in mine eyes: and I went to the physicians, but theyhelped me not: moreover Achiacharus did nourish me, until I went intoElymais.   

{2:11} And my wife Anna did take women's works to do.   

{2:12} And when she had sent them home to the owners, they paid herwages, and gave her also besides a kid.   

{2:13} And when it was in my house, and began to cry, I said untoher, From whence is this kid? is it not stolen? render it to theowners; for it is not lawful to eat any thing that is stolen.   

{2:14} But she replied upon me, It was given for a gift more thanthe wages. Howbeit I did not believe her, but bade her render it to theowners: and I was abashed at her. But she replied upon me, Where arethine alms and thy righteous deeds? behold, thou and all thy works areknown.   

{3:1} Then I being grieved did weep, and in my sorrow prayed, saying,   

{3:2} O Lord, thou art just, and all thy works and all thy ways aremercy and truth, and thou judgest truly and justly for ever.   

{3:3} Remember me, and look on me, punish me not for my sins andignorances, and the sins of my fathers, who have sinned before thee:   

{3:4} For they obeyed not thy commandments: wherefore thou hastdelivered us for a spoil, and unto captivity, and unto death, and for aproverb of reproach to all the nations among whom we are dispersed.   

{3:5} And now thy judgments are many and true: deal with meaccording to my sins and my fathers': because we have not kept thycommandments, neither have walked in truth before thee.   

{3:6} Now therefore deal with me as seemeth best unto thee, andcommand my spirit to be taken from me, that I may be dissolved, andbecome earth: for it is profitable for me to die rather than to live,because I have heard false reproaches, and have much sorrow: commandtherefore that I may now be delivered out of this distress, and go intothe everlasting place: turn not thy face away from me.   

{3:7} It came to pass the same day, that in Ecbatane a city of MediaSara the daughter of Raguel was also reproached by her father's maids;   

{3:8} Because that she had been married to seven husbands, whomAsmodeus the evil spirit had killed, before they had lain with her.Dost thou not know, said they, that thou hast strangled thine husbands?thou hast had already seven husbands, neither wast thou named after anyof them.   

{3:9} Wherefore dost thou beat us for them? if they be dead, go thyways after them, let us never see of thee either son or daughter.   

{3:10} Whe she heard these things, she was very sorrowful, so thatshe thought to have strangled herself; and she said, I am the onlydaughter of my father, and if I do this, it shall be a reproach untohim, and I shall bring his old age with sorrow unto the grave.   

{3:11} Then she prayed toward the window, and said, Blessed artthou, O Lord my God, and thine holy and glorious name is blessed andhonourable for ever: let all thy works praise thee for ever.   

{3:12} And now, O Lord, I set mine eyes and my face toward thee,   

{3:13} And say, Take me out of the earth, that I may hear no morethe reproach.   

{3:14} Thou knowest, Lord, that I am pure from all sin with man,   

{3:15} And that I never polluted my name, nor the name of my father,in the land of my captivity: I am the only daughter of my father,neither hath he any child to be his heir, neither any near kinsman, norany son of his alive, to whom I may keep myself for a wife: my sevenhusbands are already dead; and why should I live? but if it please notthee that I should die, command some regard to be had of me, and pitytaken of me, that I hear no more reproach.   

{3:16} So the prayers of them both were heard before the majesty ofthe great God.   

{3:17} And Raphael was sent to heal them both, that is, to scaleaway the whiteness of Tobit's eyes, and to give Sara the daughter ofRaguel for a wife to Tobias the son of Tobit; and to bind Asmodeus theevil spirit; because she belonged to Tobias by right of inheritance.The selfsame time came Tobit home, and entered into his house, and Sarathe daughter of Raguel came down from her upper chamber.   

{4:1} In that day Tobit remembered the money which he had committedto Gabael in Rages of Media,   

{4:2} And said with himself, I have wished for death; wherefore do Inot call for my son Tobias that I may signify to him of the moneybefore I die?   

{4:3} And when he had called him, he said, My son, when I am dead,bury me; and despise not thy mother, but honour her all the days of thylife, and do that which shall please her, and grieve her not.   

{4:4} Remember, my son, that she saw many dangers for thee, whenthou wast in her womb: and when she is dead, bury her by me in onegrave.   

{4:5} My son, be mindful of the Lord our God all thy days, and letnot thy will be set to sin, or to transgress his commandments: douprightly all thy life long, and follow not the ways of unrighteousness.   

{4:6} For if thou deal truly, thy doings shall prosperously succeedto thee, and to all them that live justly.   

{4:7} Give alms of thy substance; and when thou givest alms, let notthine eye be envious, neither turn thy face from any poor, and the faceof God shall not be turned away from thee.   

{4:8} If thou hast abundance give alms accordingly: if thou have buta little, be not afraid to give according to that little:   

{4:9} For thou layest up a good treasure for thyself against the dayof necessity.   

{4:10} Because that alms do deliver from death, and suffereth not tocome into darkness.   

{4:11} For alms is a good gift unto all that give it in the sight ofthe most High.   

{4:12} Beware of all whoredom, my son, and chiefly take a wife ofthe seed of thy fathers, and take not a strange woman to wife, which isnot of thy father's tribe: for we are the children of the prophets,Noe, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob: remember, my son, that our fathers fromthe beginning, even that they all married wives of their own kindred,and were blessed in their children, and their seed shall inherit theland.   

{4:13} Now therefore, my son, love thy brethren, and despise not inthy heart thy brethren, the sons and daughters of thy people, in nottaking a wife of them: for in pride is destruction and much trouble,and in lewdness is decay and great want: for lewdness is the mother offamine.   

{4:14} Let not the wages of any man, which hath wrought for thee,tarry with thee, but give him it out of hand: for if thou serve God, hewill also repay thee: be circumspect my son, in all things thou doest,and be wise in all thy conversation.   

{4:15} Do that to no man which thou hatest: drink not wine to makethee drunken: neither let drunkenness go with thee in thy journey.   

{4:16} Give of thy bread to the hungry, and of thy garments to themthat are naked; and according to thine abundance give alms: and let notthine eye be envious, when thou givest alms.   

{4:17} Pour out thy bread on the burial of the just, but givenothing to the wicked.   

{4:18} Ask counsel of all that are wise, and despise not any counselthat is profitable.   

{4:19} Bless the Lord thy God alway, and desire of him that thy waysmay be directed, and that all thy paths and counsels may prosper: forevery nation hath not counsel; but the Lord himself giveth all goodthings, and he humbleth whom he will, as he will; now therefore, myson, remember my commandments, neither let them be put out of thy mind.   

{4:20} And now I signify this to they that I committed ten talentsto Gabael the son of Gabrias at Rages in Media.   

{4:21} And fear not, my son, that we are made poor: for thou hastmuch wealth, if thou fear God, and depart from all sin, and do thatwhich is pleasing in his sight.   

{5:1} Tobias then answered and said, Father, I will do all thingswhich thou hast commanded me:   

{5:2} But how can I receive the money, seeing I know him not?   

{5:3} Then he gave him the handwriting, and said unto him, Seek theea man which may go with thee, whiles I yet live, and I will give himwages: and go and receive the money.   

{5:4} Therefore when he went to seek a man, he found Raphael thatwas an angel.   

{5:5} But he knew not; and he said unto him, Canst thou go with meto Rages? and knowest thou those places well?   

{5:6} To whom the angel said, I will go with thee, and I know theway well: for I have lodged with our brother Gabael.   

{5:7} Then Tobias said unto him, Tarry for me, till I tell my father.   

{5:8} Then he said unto him, Go and tarry not. So he went in andsaid to his father, Behold, I have found one which will go with me.Then he said, Call him unto me, that I may know of what tribe he is,and whether he be a trusty man to go with thee.   

{5:9} So he called him, and he came in, and they saluted one another.   

{5:10} Then Tobit said unto him, Brother, shew me of what tribe andfamily thou art.   

{5:11} To whom he said, Dost thou seek for a tribe or family, or anhired man to go with thy son? Then Tobit said unto him, I would know,brother, thy kindred and name.   

{5:12} Then he said, I am Azarias, the son of Ananias the great, andof thy brethren.   

{5:13} Then Tobit said, Thou art welcome, brother; be not now angrywith me, because I have enquired to know thy tribe and thy family; forthou art my brother, of an honest and good stock: for I know Ananiasand Jonathas, sons of that great Samaias, as we went together toJerusalem to worship, and offered the firstborn, and the tenths of thefruits; and they were not seduced with the error of our brethren: mybrother, thou art of a good stock.   

{5:14} But tell me, what wages shall I give thee? wilt thou a drachma day, and things necessary, as to mine own son?   

{5:15} Yea, moreover, if ye return safe, I will add something to thywages.   

{5:16} So they were well pleased. Then said he to Tobias, Preparethyself for the journey, and God send you a good journey. And when hisson had prepared all things for the journey, his father said, Go thouwith this man, and God, which dwelleth in heaven, prosper your journey,and the angel of God keep you company. So they went forth both, and theyoung man's dog with them.   

{5:17} But Anna his mother wept, and said to Tobit, Why hast thousent away our son? is he not the staff of our hand, in going in and outbefore us?   

{5:18} Be not greedy to add money to money: but let it be as refusein respect of our child.   

{5:19} For that which the Lord hath given us to live with dothsuffice us.   

{5:20} Then said Tobit to her, Take no care, my sister; he shallreturn in safety, and thine eyes shall see him.   

{5:21} For the good angel will keep him company, and his journeyshall be prosperous, and he shall return safe.   

{5:22} Then she made an end of weeping.   

{6:1} And as they went on their journey, they came in the evening tothe river Tigris, and they lodged there.   

{6:2} And when the young man went down to wash himself, a fishleaped out of the river, and would have devoured him.   

{6:3} Then the angel said unto him, Take the fish. And the young manlaid hold of the fish, and drew it to land.   

{6:4} To whom the angel said, Open the fish, and take the heart andthe liver and the gall, and put them up safely.   

{6:5} So the young man did as the angel commanded him; and when theyhad roasted the fish, they did eat it: then they both went on theirway, till they drew near to Ecbatane.   

{6:6} Then the young man said to the angel, Brother Azarias, to whatuse is the heart and the liver and the gal of the fish?   

{6:7} And he said unto him, Touching the heart and the liver, if adevil or an evil spirit trouble any, we must make a smoke thereofbefore the man or the woman, and the party shall be no more vexed.   

{6:8} As for the gall, it is good to anoint a man that hathwhiteness in his eyes, and he shall be healed.   

{6:9} And when they were come near to Rages,   

{6:10} The angel said to the young man, Brother, to day we shalllodge with Raguel, who is thy cousin; he also hath one only daughter,named Sara; I will speak for her, that she may be given thee for a wife.   

{6:11} For to thee doth the right of her appertain, seeing thou onlyart of her kindred.   

{6:12} And the maid is fair and wise: now therefore hear me, and Iwill speak to her father; and when we return from Rages we willcelebrate the marriage: for I know that Raguel cannot marry her toanother according to the law of Moses, but he shall be guilty of death,because the right of inheritance doth rather appertain to thee than toany other.   

{6:13} Then the young man answered the angel, I have heard, brotherAzarias that this maid hath been given to seven men, who all died inthe marriage chamber.   

{6:14} And now I am the only son of my father, and I am afraid, lestif I go in unto her, I die, as the other before: for a wicked spiritloveth her, which hurteth no body, but those which come unto her;wherefore I also fear lest I die, and bring my father's and my mother'slife because of me to the grave with sorrow: for they have no other sonto bury them.   

{6:15} Then the angel said unto him, Dost thou not remember theprecepts which thy father gave thee, that thou shouldest marry a wifeof thine own kindred? wherefore hear me, O my brother; for she shall begiven thee to wife; and make thou no reckoning of the evil spirit; forthis same night shall she be given thee in marriage.   

{6:16} And when thou shalt come into the marriage chamber, thoushalt take the ashes of perfume, and shalt lay upon them some of theheart and liver of the fish, and shalt make a smoke with it:   

{6:17} And the devil shall smell it, and flee away, and never comeagain any more: but when thou shalt come to her, rise up both of you,and pray to God which is merciful, who will have pity on you, and saveyou: fear not, for she is appointed unto thee from the beginning; andthou shalt preserve her, and she shall go with thee. Moreover I supposethat she shall bear thee children. Now when Tobias had heard thesethings, he loved her, and his heart was effectually joined to her.   

{7:1} And when they were come to Ecbatane, they came to the house ofRaguel, and Sara met them: and after they had saluted one another, shebrought them into the house.   

{7:2} Then said Raguel to Edna his wife, How like is this young manto Tobit my cousin!   

{7:3} And Raguel asked them, From whence are ye, brethren? To whomthey said, We are of the sons of Nephthalim, which are captives inNineve.   

{7:4} Then he said to them, Do ye know Tobit our kinsman? And theysaid, We know him. Then said he, Is he in good health?   

{7:5} And they said, He is both alive, and in good health: andTobias said, He is my father.   

{7:6} Then Raguel leaped up, and kissed him, and wept,   

{7:7} And blessed him, and said unto him, Thou art the son of anhonest and good man. But when he had heard that Tobit was blind, he wassorrowful, and wept.   

{7:8} And likewise Edna his wife and Sara his daughter wept.Moreover they entertained them cheerfully; and after that they hadkilled a ram of the flock, they set store of meat on the table. Thensaid Tobias to Raphael, Brother Azarias, speak of those things of whichthou didst talk in the way, and let this business be dispatched.   

{7:9} So he communicated the matter with Raguel: and Raguel said toTobias, Eat and drink, and make merry:   

{7:10} For it is meet that thou shouldest marry my daughter:nevertheless I will declare unto thee the truth.   

{7:11} I have given my daughter in marriage to seven men, who diedthat night they came in unto her: nevertheless for the present bemerry. But Tobias said, I will eat nothing here, till we agree andswear one to another.   

{7:12} Raguel said, Then take her from henceforth according to themanner, for thou art her cousin, and she is thine, and the merciful Godgive you good success in all things.   

{7:13} Then he called his daughter Sara, and she came to her father,and he took her by the hand, and gave her to be wife to Tobias, saying,Behold, take her after the law of Moses, and lead her away to thyfather. And he blessed them;   

{7:14} And called Edna his wife, and took paper, and did write aninstrument of covenants, and sealed it.   

{7:15} Then they began to eat.   

{7:16} After Raguel called his wife Edna, and said unto her, Sister,prepare another chamber, and bring her in thither.   

{7:17} Which when she had done as he had bidden her, she brought herthither: and she wept, and she received the tears of her daughter, andsaid unto her,   

{7:18} Be of good comfort, my daughter; the Lord of heaven and earthgive thee joy for this thy sorrow: be of good comfort, my daughter.   

{8:1} And when they had supped, they brought Tobias in unto her.   

{8:2} And as he went, he remembered the words of Raphael, and tookthe ashes of the perfumes, and put the heart and the liver of the fishthereupon, and made a smoke therewith.   

{8:3} The which smell when the evil spirit had smelled, he fled intothe utmost parts of Egypt, and the angel bound him.   

{8:4} And after that they were both shut in together, Tobias roseout of the bed, and said, Sister, arise, and let us pray that God wouldhave pity on us.   

{8:5} Then began Tobias to say, Blessed art thou, O God of ourfathers, and blessed is thy holy and glorious name for ever; let theheavens bless thee, and all thy creatures.   

{8:6} Thou madest Adam, and gavest him Eve his wife for an helperand stay: of them came mankind: thou hast said, It is not good that manshould be alone; let us make unto him an aid like unto himself.   

{8:7} And now, O Lord, I take not this my sister for lust butuprightly: therefore mercifully ordain that we may become aged together.   

{8:8} And she said with him, Amen.   

{8:9} So they slept both that night. And Raguel arose, and went andmade a grave,   

{8:10} Saying, I fear lest he also be dead.   

{8:11} But when Raguel was come into his house,   

{8:12} He said unto his wife Edna. Send one of the maids, and lether see whether he be alive: if he be not, that we may bury him, and noman know it.   

{8:13} So the maid opened the door, and went in, and found them bothasleep,   

{8:14} And came forth, and told them that he was alive.   

{8:15} Then Raguel praised God, and said, O God, thou art worthy tobe praised with all pure and holy praise; therefore let thy saintspraise thee with all thy creatures; and let all thine angels and thineelect praise thee for ever.   

{8:16} Thou art to be praised, for thou hast made me joyful; andthat is not come to me which I suspected; but thou hast dealt with usaccording to thy great mercy.   

{8:17} Thou art to be praised because thou hast had mercy of twothat were the only begotten children of their fathers: grant themmercy, O Lord, and finish their life in health with joy and mercy.   

{8:18} Then Raguel bade his servants to fill the grave.   

{8:19} And he kept the wedding feast fourteen days.   

{8:20} For before the days of the marriage were finished, Raguel hadsaid unto him by an oath, that he should not depart till the fourteendays of the marriage were expired;   

{8:21} And then he should take the half of his goods, and go insafety to his father; and should have the rest when I and my wife bedead.   

{9:1} Then Tobias called Raphael, and said unto him,   

{9:2} Brother Azarias, take with thee a servant, and two camels, andgo to Rages of Media to Gabael, and bring me the money, and bring himto the wedding.   

{9:3} For Raguel hath sworn that I shall not depart.   

{9:4} But my father counteth the days; and if I tarry long, he willbe very sorry.   

{9:5} So Raphael went out, and lodged with Gabael, and gave him thehandwriting: who brought forth bags which were sealed up, and gave themto him.   

{9:6} And early in the morning they went forth both together, andcame to the wedding: and Tobias blessed his wife.   

{10:1} Now Tobit his father counted every day: and when the days ofthe journey were expired, and they came not,   

{10:2} Then Tobit said, Are they detained? or is Gabael dead, andthere is no man to give him the money?   

{10:3} Therefore he was very sorry.   

{10:4} Then his wife said unto him, My son is dead, seeing hestayeth long; and she began to wail him, and said,   

{10:5} Now I care for nothing, my son, since I have let thee go, thelight of mine eyes.   

{10:6} To whom Tobit said, Hold thy peace, take no care, for he issafe.   

{10:7} But she said, Hold thy peace, and deceive me not; my son isdead. And she went out every day into the way which they went, and dideat no meat on the daytime, and ceased not whole nights to bewail herson Tobias, until the fourteen days of the wedding were expired, whichRaguel had sworn that he should spend there. Then Tobias said toRaguel, Let me go, for my father and my mother look no more to see me.   

{10:8} But his father in law said unto him, Tarry with me, and Iwill send to thy father, and they shall declare unto him how things gowith thee.   

{10:9} But Tobias said, No; but let me go to my father.   

{10:10} Then Raguel arose, and gave him Sara his wife, and half hisgoods, servants, and cattle, and money:   

{10:11} And he blessed them, and sent them away, saying, The God ofheaven give you a prosperous journey, my children.   

{10:12} And he said to his daughter, Honour thy father and thymother in law, which are now thy parents, that I may hear good reportof thee. And he kissed her. Edna also said to Tobias, The Lord ofheaven restore thee, my dear brother, and grant that I may see thychildren of my daughter Sara before I die, that I may rejoice beforethe Lord: behold, I commit my daughter unto thee of special trust;where are do not entreat her evil.   

{11:1} After these things Tobias went his way, praising God that hehad given him a prosperous journey, and blessed Raguel and Edna hiswife, and went on his way till they drew near unto Nineve.   

{11:2} Then Raphael said to Tobias, Thou knowest, brother, how thoudidst leave thy father:   

{11:3} Let us haste before thy wife, and prepare the house.   

{11:4} And take in thine hand the gall of the fish. So they wenttheir way, and the dog went after them.   

{11:5} Now Anna sat looking about toward the way for her son.   

{11:6} And when she espied him coming, she said to his father,Behold, thy son cometh, and the man that went with him.   

{11:7} Then said Raphael, I know, Tobias, that thy father will openhis eyes.   

{11:8} Therefore anoint thou his eyes with the gall, and beingpricked therewith, he shall rub, and the whiteness shall fall away, andhe shall see thee.   

{11:9} Then Anna ran forth, and fell upon the neck of her son, andsaid unto him, Seeing I have seen thee, my son, from henceforth I amcontent to die. And they wept both.   

{11:10} Tobit also went forth toward the door, and stumbled: but hisson ran unto him,   

{11:11} And took hold of his father: and he strake of the gall onhis fathers' eyes, saying, Be of good hope, my father.   

{11:12} And when his eyes began to smart, he rubbed them;   

{11:13} And the whiteness pilled away from the corners of his eyes:and when he saw his son, he fell upon his neck.   

{11:14} And he wept, and said, Blessed art thou, O God, and blessedis thy name for ever; and blessed are all thine holy angels:   

{11:15} For thou hast scourged, and hast taken pity on me: for,behold, I see my son Tobias. And his son went in rejoicing, and toldhis father the great things that had happened to him in Media.   

{11:16} Then Tobit went out to meet his daughter in law at the gateof Nineve, rejoicing and praising God: and they which saw him gomarvelled, because he had received his sight.   

{11:17} But Tobias gave thanks before them, because God had mercy onhim. And when he came near to Sara his daughter in law, he blessed her,saying, Thou art welcome, daughter: God be blessed, which hath broughtthee unto us, and blessed be thy father and thy mother. And there wasjoy among all his brethren which were at Nineve.   

{11:18} And Achiacharus, and Nasbas his brother's son, came:   

{11:19} And Tobias' wedding was kept seven days with great joy.   

{12:1} Then Tobit called his son Tobias, and said unto him, My son,see that the man have his wages, which went with thee, and thou mustgive him more.   

{12:2} And Tobias said unto him, O father, it is no harm to me togive him half of those things which I have brought:   

{12:3} For he hath brought me again to thee in safety, and madewhole my wife, and brought me the money, and likewise healed thee.   

{12:4} Then the old man said, It is due unto him.   

{12:5} So he called the angel, and he said unto him, Take half ofall that ye have brought and go away in safety.   

{12:6} Then he took them both apart, and said unto them, Bless God,praise him, and magnify him, and praise him for the things which hehath done unto you in the sight of all that live. It is good to praiseGod, and exalt his name, and honourably to shew forth the works of God;therefore be not slack to praise him.   

{12:7} It is good to keep close the secret of a king, but it ishonourable to reveal the works of God. Do that which is good, and noevil shall touch you.   

{12:8} Prayer is good with fasting and alms and righteousness. Alittle with righteousness is better than much with unrighteousness. Itis better to give alms than to lay up gold:   

{12:9} For alms doth deliver from death, and shall purge away allsin. Those that exercise alms and righteousness shall be filled withlife:   

{12:10} But they that sin are enemies to their own life.   

{12:11} Surely I will keep close nothing from you. For I said, Itwas good to keep close the secret of a king, but that it was honourableto reveal the works of God.   

{12:12} Now therefore, when thou didst pray, and Sara thy daughterin law, I did bring the remembrance of your prayers before the HolyOne: and when thou didst bury the dead, I was with thee likewise.   

{12:13} And when thou didst not delay to rise up, and leave thydinner, to go and cover the dead, thy good deed was not hid from me:but I was with thee.   

{12:14} And now God hath sent me to heal thee and Sara thy daughterin law.   

{12:15} I am Raphael, one of the seven holy angels, which presentthe prayers of the saints, and which go in and out before the glory ofthe Holy One.   

{12:16} Then they were both troubled, and fell upon their faces: forthey feared.   

{12:17} But he said unto them, Fear not, for it shall go well withyou; praise God therefore.   

{12:18} For not of any favour of mine, but by the will of our God Icame; wherefore praise him for ever.   

{12:19} All these days I did appear unto you; but I did neither eatnor drink, but ye did see a vision.   

{12:20} Now therefore give God thanks: for I go up to him that sentme; but write all things which are done in a book.   

{12:21} And when they arose, they saw him no more.   

{12:22} Then they confessed the great and wonderful works of God,and how the angel of the Lord had appeared unto them.   

{13:1} Then Tobit wrote a prayer of rejoicing, and said, Blessed beGod that liveth for ever, and blessed be his kingdom.   

{13:2} For he doth scourge, and hath mercy: he leadeth down to hell,and bringeth up again: neither is there any that can avoid his hand.   

{13:3} Confess him before the Gentiles, ye children of Israel: forhe hath scattered us among them.   

{13:4} There declare his greatness, and extol him before all theliving: for he is our Lord, and he is the God our Father for ever.   

{13:5} And he will scourge us for our iniquities, and will havemercy again, and will gather us out of all nations, among whom he hathscattered us.   

{13:6} If ye turn to him with your whole heart, and with your wholemind, and deal uprightly before him, then will he turn unto you, andwill not hide his face from you. Therefore see what he will do withyou, and confess him with your whole mouth, and praise the Lord ofmight, and extol the everlasting King. In the land of my captivity do Ipraise him, and declare his might and majesty to a sinful nation. O yesinners, turn and do justice before him: who can tell if he will acceptyou, and have mercy on you?   

{13:7} I will extol my God, and my soul shall praise the King ofheaven, and shall rejoice in his greatness.   

{13:8} Let all men speak, and let all praise him for hisrighteousness.   

{13:9} O Jerusalem, the holy city, he will scourge thee for thychildren's works, and will have mercy again on the sons of therighteous.   

{13:10} Give praise to the Lord, for he is good: and praise theeverlasting King, that his tabernacle may be builded in thee again withjoy, and let him make joyful there in thee those that are captives, andlove in thee for ever those that are miserable.   

{13:11} Many nations shall come from far to the name of the Lord Godwith gifts in their hands, even gifts to the King of heaven; allgenerations shall praise thee with great joy.   

{13:12} Cursed are all they which hate thee, and blessed shall allbe which love thee for ever.   

{13:13} Rejoice and be glad for the children of the just: for theyshall be gathered together, and shall bless the Lord of the just.   

{13:14} O blessed are they which love thee, for they shall rejoicein thy peace: blessed are they which have been sorrowful for all thyscourges; for they shall rejoice for thee, when they have seen all thyglory, and shall be glad for ever.   

{13:15} Let my soul bless God the great King.   

{13:16} For Jerusalem shall be built up with sapphires and emeralds,and precious stone: thy walls and towers and battlements with pure gold.   

{13:17} And the streets of Jerusalem shall be paved with beryl andcarbuncle and stones of Ophir.   

{13:18} And all her streets shall say, Alleluia; and they shallpraise him, saying, Blessed be God, which hath extolled it for ever.   

{14:1} So Tobit made an end of praising God.   

{14:2} And he was eight and fifty years old when he lost his sight,which was restored to him after eight years: and he gave alms, and heincreased in the fear of the Lord God, and praised him.   

{14:3} And when he was very aged he called his son, and the sons ofhis son, and said to him, My son, take thy children; for, behold, I amaged, and am ready to depart out of this life.   

{14:4} Go into Media my son, for I surely believe those things whichJonas the prophet spake of Nineve, that it shall be overthrown; andthat for a time peace shall rather be in Media; and that our brethrenshall lie scattered in the earth from that good land: and Jerusalemshall be desolate, and the house of God in it shall be burned, andshall be desolate for a time;   

{14:5} And that again God will have mercy on them, and bring themagain into the land, where they shall build a temple, but not like tothe first, until the time of that age be fulfilled; and afterward theyshall return from all places of their captivity, and build up Jerusalemgloriously, and the house of God shall be built in it for ever with aglorious building, as the prophets have spoken thereof.   

{14:6} And all nations shall turn, and fear the Lord God truly, andshall bury their idols.   

{14:7} So shall all nations praise the Lord, and his people shallconfess God, and the Lord shall exalt his people; and all those whichlove the Lord God in truth and justice shall rejoice, shewing mercy toour brethren.   

{14:8} And now, my son, depart out of Nineve, because that thosethings which the prophet Jonas spake shall surely come to pass.   

{14:9} But keep thou the law and the commandments, and shew thyselfmerciful and just, that it may go well with thee.   

{14:10} And bury me decently, and thy mother with me; but tarry nolonger at Nineve. Remember, my son, how Aman handled Achiacharus thatbrought him up, how out of light he brought him into darkness, and howhe rewarded him again: yet Achiacharus was saved, but the other had hisreward: for he went down into darkness. Manasses gave alms, and escapedthe snares of death which they had set for him: but Aman fell into thesnare, and perished.   

{14:11} Wherefore now, my son, consider what alms doeth, and howrighteousness doth deliver. When he had said these things, he gave upthe ghost in the bed, being an hundred and eight and fifty years old;and he buried him honourably.   

{14:12} And when Anna his mother was dead, he buried her with hisfather. But Tobias departed with his wife and children to Ecbatane toRaguel his father in law,   

{14:13} Where he became old with honour, and he buried his fatherand mother in law honourably, and he inherited their substance, and hisfather Tobit's.   

{14:14} And he died at Ecbatane in Media, being an hundred and sevenand twenty years old.   

{14:15} But before he died he heard of the destruction of Nineve,which was taken by Nabuchodonosor and Assuerus: and before his death herejoiced over Nineve.The Book of Judith   

{1:1} In the twelfth year of the reign of Nabuchodonosor, whoreigned in Nineve, the great city; in the days of Arphaxad, whichreigned over the Medes in Ecbatane,   

{1:2} And built in Ecbatane walls round about of stones hewn threecubits broad and six cubits long, and made the height of the wallseventy cubits, and the breadth thereof fifty cubits:   

{1:3} And set the towers thereof upon the gates of it an hundredcubits high, and the breadth thereof in the foundation threescorecubits:   

{1:4} And he made the gates thereof, even gates that were raised tothe height of seventy cubits, and the breadth of them was forty cubits,for the going forth of his mighty armies, and for the setting in arrayof his footmen:   

{1:5} Even in those days king Nabuchodonosor made war with kingArphaxad in the great plain, which is the plain in the borders of Ragau.   

{1:6} And there came unto him all they that dwelt in the hillcountry, and all that dwelt by Euphrates, and Tigris and Hydaspes, andthe plain of Arioch the king of the Elymeans, and very many nations ofthe sons of Chelod, assembled themselves to the battle.   

{1:7} Then Nabuchodonosor king of the Assyrians sent unto all thatdwelt in Persia, and to all that dwelt westward, and to those thatdwelt in Cilicia, and Damascus, and Libanus, and Antilibanus, and toall that dwelt upon the sea coast,   

{1:8} And to those among the nations that were of Carmel, andGalaad, and the higher Galilee, and the great plain of Esdrelom,   

{1:9} And to all that were in Samaria and the cities thereof, andbeyond Jordan unto Jerusalem, and Betane, and Chelus, and Kades, andthe river of Egypt, and Taphnes, and Ramesse, and all the land of Gesem,   

{1:10} Until ye come beyond Tanis and Memphis, and to all theinhabitants of Egypt, until ye come to the borders of Ethiopia.   

{1:11} But all the inhabitants of the land made light of thecommandment of Nabuchodonosor king of the Assyrians, neither went theywith him to the battle; for they were not afraid of him: yea, he wasbefore them as one man, and they sent away his ambassadors from themwithout effect, and with disgrace.   

{1:12} Therefore Nabuchodonosor was very angry with all thiscountry, and sware by his throne and kingdom, that he would surely beavenged upon all those coasts of Cilicia, and Damascus, and Syria, andthat he would slay with the sword all the inhabitants of the land ofMoab, and the children of Ammon, and all Judea, and all that were inEgypt, till ye come to the borders of the two seas.   

{1:13} Then he marched in battle array with his power against kingArphaxad in the seventeenth year, and he prevailed in his battle: forhe overthrew all the power of Arphaxad, and all his horsemen, and allhis chariots,   

{1:14} And became lord of his cities, and came unto Ecbatane, andtook the towers, and spoiled the streets thereof, and turned the beautythereof into shame.   

{1:15} He took also Arphaxad in the mountains of Ragau, and smotehim through with his darts, and destroyed him utterly that day.   

{1:16} So he returned afterward to Nineve, both he and all hiscompany of sundry nations being a very great multitude of men of war,and there he took his ease, and banqueted, both he and his army, anhundred and twenty days.   

{2:1} And in the eighteenth year, the two and twentieth day of thefirst month, there was talk in the house of Nabuchodonosor king of theAssyrians that he should, as he said, avenge himself on all the earth.   

{2:2} So he called unto him all his officers, and all his nobles,and communicated with them his secret counsel, and concluded theafflicting of the whole earth out of his own mouth.   

{2:3} Then they decreed to destroy all flesh, that did not obey thecommandment of his mouth.   

{2:4} And when he had ended his counsel, Nabuchodonosor king of theAssyrians called Holofernes the chief captain of his army, which wasnext unto him, and said unto him.   

{2:5} Thus saith the great king, the lord of the whole earth,Behold, thou shalt go forth from my presence, and take with thee menthat trust in their own strength, of footmen an hundred and twentythousand; and the number of horses with their riders twelve thousand.   

{2:6} And thou shalt go against all the west country, because theydisobeyed my commandment.   

{2:7} And thou shalt declare unto that they prepare for me earth andwater: for I will go forth in my wrath against them and will cover thewhole face of the earth with the feet of mine army, and I will givethem for a spoil unto them:   

{2:8} So that their slain shall fill their valleys and brooks andthe river shall be filled with their dead, till it overflow:   

{2:9} And I will lead them captives to the utmost parts of all theearth.   

{2:10} Thou therefore shalt go forth. and take beforehand for me alltheir coasts: and if they will yield themselves unto thee, thou shaltreserve them for me till the day of their punishment.   

{2:11} But concerning them that rebel, let not thine eye spare them;but put them to the slaughter, and spoil them wheresoever thou goest.   

{2:12} For as I live, and by the power of my kingdom, whatsoever Ihave spoken, that will I do by mine hand.   

{2:13} And take thou heed that thou transgress none of thecommandments of thy lord, but accomplish them fully, as I havecommanded thee, and defer not to do them.   

{2:14} Then Holofernes went forth from the presence of his lord, andcalled all the governors and captains, and the officers of the army ofAssur;   

{2:15} And he mustered the chosen men for the battle, as his lordhad commanded him, unto an hundred and twenty thousand, and twelvethousand archers on horseback;   

{2:16} And he ranged them, as a great army is ordered for the war.   

{2:17} And he took camels and asses for their carriages, a verygreat number; and sheep and oxen and goats without number for theirprovision:   

{2:18} And plenty of victual for every man of the army, and verymuch gold and silver out of the king's house.   

{2:19} Then he went forth and all his power to go before kingNabuchodonosor in the voyage, and to cover all the face of the earthwestward with their chariots, and horsemen, and their chosen footmen.   

{2:20} A great number also sundry countries came with them likelocusts, and like the sand of the earth: for the multitude was withoutnumber.   

{2:21} And they went forth of Nineve three days' journey toward theplain of Bectileth, and pitched from Bectileth near the mountain whichis at the left hand of the upper Cilicia.   

{2:22} Then he took all his army, his footmen, and horsemen andchariots, and went from thence into the hill country;   

{2:23} And destroyed Phud and Lud, and spoiled all the children ofRasses, and the children of Israel, which were toward the wilderness atthe south of the land of the Chellians.   

{2:24} Then he went over Euphrates, and went through Mesopotamia,and destroyed all the high cities that were upon the river Arbonai,till ye come to the sea.   

{2:25} And he took the borders of Cilicia, and killed all thatresisted him, and came to the borders of Japheth, which were toward thesouth, over against Arabia.   

{2:26} He compassed also all the children of Madian, and burned uptheir tabernacles, and spoiled their sheepcotes.   

{2:27} Then he went down into the plain of Damascus in the time ofwheat harvest, and burnt up all their fields, and destroyed theirflocks and herds, also he spoiled their cities, and utterly wastedtheir countries, and smote all their young men with the edge of thesword.   

{2:28} Therefore the fear and dread of him fell upon all theinhabitants of the sea coasts, which were in Sidon and Tyrus, and themthat dwelt in Sur and Ocina, and all that dwelt in Jemnaan; and theythat dwelt in Azotus and Ascalon feared him greatly.   

{3:1} So they sent ambassadors unto him to treat of peace, saying,   

{3:2} Behold, we the servants of Nabuchodonosor the great king liebefore thee; use us as shall be good in thy sight.   

{3:3} Behold, our houses, and all our places, and all our fields ofwheat, and flocks, and herds, and all the lodges of our tents liebefore thy face; use them as it pleaseth thee.   

{3:4} Behold, even our cities and the inhabitants thereof are thyservants; come and deal with them as seemeth good unto thee.   

{3:5} So the men came to Holofernes, and declared unto him afterthis manner.   

{3:6} Then came he down toward the sea coast, both he and his army,and set garrisons in the high cities, and took out of them chosen menfor aid.   

{3:7} So they and all the country round about received them withgarlands, with dances, and with timbrels.   

{3:8} Yet he did cast down their frontiers, and cut down theirgroves: for he had decreed to destroy all the gods of the land, thatall nations should worship Nabuchodonosor only, and that all tonguesand tribes should call upon him as god.   

{3:9} Also he came over against Esdraelon near unto Judea, overagainst the great strait of Judea.   

{3:10} And he pitched between Geba and Scythopolis, and there hetarried a whole month, that he might gather together all the carriagesof his army.   

{4:1} Now the children of Israel, that dwelt in Judea, heard allthat Holofernes the chief captain of Nabuchodonosor king of theAssyrians had done to the nations, and after what manner he had spoiledall their temples, and brought them to nought.   

{4:2} Therefore they were exceedingly afraid of him, and weretroubled for Jerusalem, and for the temple of the Lord their God:   

{4:3} For they were newly returned from the captivity, and all thepeople of Judea were lately gathered together: and the vessels, and thealtar, and the house, were sanctified after the profanation.   

{4:4} Therefore they sent into all the coasts of Samaria, and thevillages and to Bethoron, and Belmen, and Jericho, and to Choba, andEsora, and to the valley of Salem:   

{4:5} And possessed themselves beforehand of all the tops of thehigh mountains, and fortified the villages that were in them, and laidup victuals for the provision of war: for their fields were of latereaped.   

{4:6} Also Joacim the high priest, which was in those days inJerusalem, wrote to them that dwelt in Bethulia, and Betomestham, whichis over against Esdraelon toward the open country, near to Dothaim,   

{4:7} Charging them to keep the passages of the hill country: for bythem there was an entrance into Judea, and it was easy to stop themthat would come up, because the passage was straight, for two men atthe most.   

{4:8} And the children of Israel did as Joacim the high priest hadcommanded them, with the ancients of all the people of Israel, whichdwelt at Jerusalem.   

{4:9} Then every man of Israel cried to God with great fervency, andwith great vehemency did they humble their souls:   

{4:10} Both they, and their wives and their children, and theircattle, and every stranger and hireling, and their servants bought withmoney, put sackcloth upon their loins.   

{4:11} Thus every man and women, and the little children, and theinhabitants of Jerusalem, fell before the temple, and cast ashes upontheir heads, and spread out their sackcloth before the face of theLord: also they put sackcloth about the altar,   

{4:12} And cried to the God of Israel all with one consentearnestly, that he would not give their children for a prey, and theirwives for a spoil, and the cities of their inheritance to destruction,and the sanctuary to profanation and reproach, and for the nations torejoice at.   

{4:13} So God heard their prayers, and looked upon theirafflictions: for the people fasted many days in all Judea and Jerusalembefore the sanctuary of the Lord Almighty.   

{4:14} And Joacim the high priest, and all the priests that stoodbefore the Lord, and they which ministered unto the Lord, had theirloins girt with sackcloth, and offered the daily burnt offerings, withthe vows and free gifts of the people,   

{4:15} And had ashes on their mitres, and cried unto the Lord withall their power, that he would look upon all the house of Israelgraciously.   

{5:1} Then was it declared to Holofernes, the chief captain of thearmy of Assur, that the children of Israel had prepared for war, andhad shut up the passages of the hill country, and had fortified all thetops of the high hills and had laid impediments in the champaigncountries:   

{5:2} Wherewith he was very angry, and called all the princes ofMoab, and the captains of Ammon, and all the governors of the sea coast,   

{5:3} And he said unto them, Tell me now, ye sons of Chanaan, whothis people is, that dwelleth in the hill country, and what are thecities that they inhabit, and what is the multitude of their army, andwherein is their power and strength, and what king is set over them, orcaptain of their army;   

{5:4} And why have they determined not to come and meet me, morethan all the inhabitants of the west.   

{5:5} Then said Achior, the captain of all the sons of Ammon, Let mylord now hear a word from the mouth of thy servant, and I will declareunto thee the truth concerning this people, which dwelleth near thee,and inhabiteth the hill countries: and there shall no lie come out ofthe mouth of thy servant.   

{5:6} This people are descended of the Chaldeans:   

{5:7} And they sojourned heretofore in Mesopotamia, because theywould not follow the gods of their fathers, which were in the land ofChaldea.   

{5:8} For they left the way of their ancestors, and worshipped theGod of heaven, the God whom they knew: so they cast them out from theface of their gods, and they fled into Mesopotamia, and sojourned theremany days.   

{5:9} Then their God commanded them to depart from the place wherethey sojourned, and to go into the land of Chanaan: where they dwelt,and were increased with gold and silver, and with very much cattle.   

{5:10} But when a famine covered all the land of Chanaan, they wentdown into Egypt, and sojourned there, while they were nourished, andbecame there a great multitude, so that one could not number theirnation.   

{5:11} Therefore the king of Egypt rose up against them, and dealtsubtilly with them, and brought them low with labouring in brick, andmade them slaves.   

{5:12} Then they cried unto their God, and he smote all the land ofEgypt with incurable plagues: so the Egyptians cast them out of theirsight.   

{5:13} And God dried the Red sea before them,   

{5:14} And brought them to mount Sina, and Cades-Barne, and castforth all that dwelt in the wilderness.   

{5:15} So they dwelt in the land of the Amorites, and they destroyedby their strength all them of Esebon, and passing over Jordan theypossessed all the hill country.   

{5:16} And they cast forth before them the Chanaanite, thePherezite, the Jebusite, and the Sychemite, and all the Gergesites, andthey dwelt in that country many days.   

{5:17} And whilst they sinned not before their God, they prospered,because the God that hateth iniquity was with them.   

{5:18} But when they departed from the way which he appointed them,they were destroyed in many battles very sore, and were led captivesinto a land that was not their's, and the temple of their God was castto the ground, and their cities were taken by the enemies.   

{5:19} But now are they returned to their God, and are come up fromthe places where they were scattered, and have possessed Jerusalem,where their sanctuary is, and are seated in the hill country; for itwas desolate.   

{5:20} Now therefore, my lord and governor, if there be any erroragainst this people, and they sin against their God, let us considerthat this shall be their ruin, and let us go up, and we shall overcomethem.   

{5:21} But if there be no iniquity in their nation, let my lord nowpass by, lest their Lord defend them, and their God be for them, and webecome a reproach before all the world.   

{5:22} And when Achior had finished these sayings, all the peoplestanding round about the tent murmured, and the chief men ofHolofernes, and all that dwelt by the sea side, and in Moab, spake thathe should kill him.   

{5:23} For, say they, we will not be afraid of the face of thechildren of Israel: for, lo, it is a people that have no strength norpower for a strong battle   

{5:24} Now therefore, lord Holofernes, we will go up, and they shallbe a prey to be devoured of all thine army.   

{6:1} And when the tumult of men that were about the council wasceased, Holofernes the chief captain of the army of Assur said untoAchior and all the Moabites before all the company of other nations,   

{6:2} And who art thou, Achior, and the hirelings of Ephraim, thatthou hast prophesied against us as to day, and hast said, that weshould not make war with the people of Israel, because their God willdefend them? and who is God but Nabuchodonosor?   

{6:3} He will send his power, and will destroy them from the face ofthe earth, and their God shall not deliver them: but we his servantswill destroy them as one man; for they are not able to sustain thepower of our horses.   

{6:4} For with them we will tread them under foot, and theirmountains shall be drunken with their blood, and their fields shall befilled with their dead bodies, and their footsteps shall not be able tostand before us, for they shall utterly perish, saith kingNabuchodonosor, lord of all the earth: for he said, None of my wordsshall be in vain.   

{6:5} And thou, Achior, an hireling of Ammon, which hast spokenthese words in the day of thine iniquity, shalt see my face no morefrom this day, until I take vengeance of this nation that came out ofEgypt.   

{6:6} And then shall the sword of mine army, and the multitude ofthem that serve me, pass through thy sides, and thou shalt fall amongtheir slain, when I return.   

{6:7} Now therefore my servants shall bring thee back into the hillcountry, and shall set thee in one of the cities of the passages:   

{6:8} And thou shalt not perish, till thou be destroyed with them.   

{6:9} And if thou persuade thyself in thy mind that they shall betaken, let not thy countenance fall: I have spoken it, and none of mywords shall be in vain.   

{6:10} Then Holofernes commanded his servants, that waited in histent, to take Achior, and bring him to Bethulia, and deliver him intothe hands of the children of Israel.   

{6:11} So his servants took him, and brought him out of the campinto the plain, and they went from the midst of the plain into the hillcountry, and came unto the fountains that were under Bethulia.   

{6:12} And when the men of the city saw them, they took up theirweapons, and went out of the city to the top of the hill: and every manthat used a sling kept them from coming up by casting of stones againstthem.   

{6:13} Nevertheless having gotten privily under the hill, they boundAchior, and cast him down, and left him at the foot of the hill, andreturned to their lord.   

{6:14} But the Israelites descended from their city, and came untohim, and loosed him, and brought him to Bethulia, and presented him tothe governors of the city:   

{6:15} Which were in those days Ozias the son of Micha, of the tribeof Simeon, and Chabris the son of Gothoniel, and Charmis the son ofMelchiel.   

{6:16} And they called together all the ancients of the city, andall their youth ran together, and their women, to the assembly, andthey set Achior in the midst of all their people. Then Ozias asked himof that which was done.   

{6:17} And he answered and declared unto them the words of thecouncil of Holofernes, and all the words that he had spoken in themidst of the princes of Assur, and whatsoever Holofernes had spokenproudly against the house of Israel.   

{6:18} Then the people fell down and worshipped God, and cried untoGod. saying,   

{6:19} O Lord God of heaven, behold their pride, and pity the lowestate of our nation, and look upon the face of those that aresanctified unto thee this day.   

{6:20} Then they comforted Achior, and praised him greatly.   

{6:21} And Ozias took him out of the assembly unto his house, andmade a feast to the elders; and they called on the God of Israel allthat night for help.   

{7:1} The next day Holofernes commanded all his army, and all hispeople which were come to take his part, that they should remove theircamp against Bethulia, to take aforehand the ascents of the hillcountry, and to make war against the children of Israel.   

{7:2} Then their strong men removed their camps in that day, and thearmy of the men of war was an hundred and seventy thousand footmen, andtwelve thousand horsemen, beside the baggage, and other men that wereafoot among them, a very great multitude.   

{7:3} And they camped in the valley near unto Bethulia, by thefountain, and they spread themselves in breadth over Dothaim even toBelmaim, and in length from Bethulia unto Cynamon, which is overagainst Esdraelon.   

{7:4} Now the children of Israel, when they saw the multitude ofthem, were greatly troubled, and said every one to his neighbour, Nowwill these men lick up the face of the earth; for neither the highmountains, nor the valleys, nor the hills, are able to bear theirweight.   

{7:5} Then every man took up his weapons of war, and when they hadkindled fires upon their towers, they remained and watched all thatnight.   

{7:6} But in the second day Holofernes brought forth all hishorsemen in the sight of the children of Israel which were in Bethulia,   

{7:7} And viewed the passages up to the city, and came to thefountains of their waters, and took them, and set garrisons of men ofwar over them, and he himself removed toward his people.   

{7:8} Then came unto him all the chief of the children of Esau, andall the governors of the people of Moab, and the captains of the seacoast, and said,   

{7:9} Let our lord now hear a word, that there be not an overthrowin thine army.   

{7:10} For this people of the children of Israel do not trust intheir spears, but in the height of the mountains wherein they dwell,because it is not easy to come up to the tops of their mountains.   

{7:11} Now therefore, my lord, fight not against them in battlearray, and there shall not so much as one man of thy people perish.   

{7:12} Remain in thy camp, and keep all the men of thine army, andlet thy servants get into their hands the fountain of water, whichissueth forth of the foot of the mountain:   

{7:13} For all the inhabitants of Bethulia have their water thence;so shall thirst kill them, and they shall give up their city, and weand our people shall go up to the tops of the mountains that are near,and will camp upon them, to watch that none go out of the city.   

{7:14} So they and their wives and their children shall be consumedwith fire, and before the sword come against them, they shall beoverthrown in the streets where they dwell.   

{7:15} Thus shalt thou render them an evil reward; because theyrebelled, and met not thy person peaceably.   

{7:16} And these words pleased Holofernes and all his servants, andhe appointed to do as they had spoken.   

{7:17} So the camp of the children of Ammon departed, and with themfive thousand of the Assyrians, and they pitched in the valley, andtook the waters, and the fountains of the waters of the children ofIsrael.   

{7:18} Then the children of Esau went up with the children of Ammon,and camped in the hill country over against Dothaim: and they sent someof them toward the south, and toward the east over against Ekrebel,which is near unto Chusi, that is upon the brook Mochmur; and the restof the army of the Assyrians camped in the plain, and covered the faceof the whole land; and their tents and carriages were pitched to a verygreat multitude.   

{7:19} Then the children of Israel cried unto the Lord their God,because their heart failed, for all their enemies had compassed themround about, and there was no way to escape out from among them.   

{7:20} Thus all the company of Assur remained about them, both theirfootmen, chariots, and horsemen, four and thirty days, so that alltheir vessels of water failed all the inhibitants of Bethulia.   

{7:21} And the cisterns were emptied, and they had not water todrink their fill for one day; for they gave them drink by measure.   

{7:22} Therefore their young children were out of heart, and theirwomen and young men fainted for thirst, and fell down in the streets ofthe city, and by the passages of the gates, and there was no longer anystrength in them.   

{7:23} Then all the people assembled to Ozias, and to the chief ofthe city, both young men, and women, and children, and cried with aloud voice, and said before all the elders,   

{7:24} God be judge between us and you: for ye have done us greatinjury, in that ye have not required peace of the children of Assur.   

{7:25} For now we have no helper: but God hath sold us into theirhands, that we should be thrown down before them with thirst and greatdestruction.   

{7:26} Now therefore call them unto you, and deliver the whole cityfor a spoil to the people of Holofernes, and to all his army.   

{7:27} For it is better for us to be made a spoil unto them, than todie for thirst: for we will be his servants, that our souls may live,and not see the death of our infants before our eyes, nor our wives norour children to die.   

{7:28} We take to witness against you the heaven and the earth, andour God and Lord of our fathers, which punisheth us according to oursins and the sins of our fathers, that he do not according as we havesaid this day.   

{7:29} Then there was great weeping with one consent in the midst ofthe assembly; and they cried unto the Lord God with a loud voice.   

{7:30} Then said Ozias to them, Brethren, be of good courage, let usyet endure five days, in the which space the Lord our God may turn hismercy toward us; for he will not forsake us utterly.   

{7:31} And if these days pass, and there come no help unto us, Iwill do according to your word.   

{7:32} And he dispersed the people, every one to their own charge;and they went unto the walls and towers of their city, and sent thewomen and children into their houses: and they were very low brought inthe city.   

{8:1} Now at that time Judith heard thereof, which was the daughterof Merari, the son of Ox, the son of Joseph, the son of Ozel, the sonof Elcia, the son of Ananias, the son of Gedeon, the son of Raphaim,the son of Acitho, the son of Eliu, the son of Eliab, the son ofNathanael, the son of Samael, the son of Salasadal, the son of Israel.   

{8:2} And Manasses was her husband, of her tribe and kindred, whodied in the barley harvest.   

{8:3} For as he stood overseeing them that bound sheaves in thefield, the heat came upon his head, and he fell on his bed, and died inthe city of Bethulia: and they buried him with his fathers in the fieldbetween Dothaim and Balamo.   

{8:4} So Judith was a widow in her house three years and four months.   

{8:5} And she made her a tent upon the top of her house, and put onsackcloth upon her loins and ware her widow's apparel.   

{8:6} And she fasted all the days of her widowhood, save the eves ofthe sabbaths, and the sabbaths, and the eves of the new moons, and thenew moons and the feasts and solemn days of the house of Israel.   

{8:7} She was also of a goodly countenance, and very beautiful tobehold: and her husband Manasses had left her gold, and silver, andmenservants and maidservants, and cattle, and lands; and she remainedupon them.   

{8:8} And there was none that gave her an ill word; as she fearedGod greatly.   

{8:9} Now when she heard the evil words of the people against thegovernor, that they fainted for lack of water; for Judith had heard allthe words that Ozias had spoken unto them, and that he had sworn todeliver the city unto the Assyrians after five days;   

{8:10} Then she sent her waitingwoman, that had the government ofall things that she had, to call Ozias and Chabris and Charmis, theancients of the city.   

{8:11} And they came unto her, and she said unto them, Hear me now,O ye governors of the inhabitants of Bethulia: for your words that yehave spoken before the people this day are not right, touching thisoath which ye made and pronounced between God and you, and havepromised to deliver the city to our enemies, unless within these daysthe Lord turn to help you.   

{8:12} And now who are ye that have tempted God this day, and standinstead of God among the children of men?   

{8:13} And now try the Lord Almighty, but ye shall never know anything.   

{8:14} For ye cannot find the depth of the heart of man, neither canye perceive the things that he thinketh: then how can ye search outGod, that hath made all these things, and know his mind, or comprehendhis purpose? Nay, my brethren, provoke not the Lord our God to anger.   

{8:15} For if he will not help us within these five days, he hathpower to defend us when he will, even every day, or to destroy usbefore our enemies.   

{8:16} Do not bind the counsels of the Lord our God: for God is notas man, that he may be threatened; neither is he as the son of man,that he should be wavering.   

{8:17} Therefore let us wait for salvation of him, and call upon himto help us, and he will hear our voice, if it please him.   

{8:18} For there arose none in our age, neither is there any now inthese days neither tribe, nor family, nor people, nor city among us,which worship gods made with hands, as hath been aforetime.   

{8:19} For the which cause our fathers were given to the sword, andfor a spoil, and had a great fall before our enemies.   

{8:20} But we know none other god, therefore we trust that he willnot despise us, nor any of our nation.   

{8:21} For if we be taken so, all Judea shall lie waste, and oursanctuary shall be spoiled; and he will require the profanation thereofat our mouth.   

{8:22} And the slaughter of our brethren, and the captivity of thecountry, and the desolation of our inheritance, will he turn upon ourheads among the Gentiles, wheresoever we shall be in bondage; and weshall be an offence and a reproach to all them that possess us.   

{8:23} For our servitude shall not be directed to favour: but theLord our God shall turn it to dishonour.   

{8:24} Now therefore, O brethren, let us shew an example to ourbrethren, because their hearts depend upon us, and the sanctuary, andthe house, and the altar, rest upon us.   

{8:25} Moreover let us give thanks to the Lord our God, which triethus, even as he did our fathers.   

{8:26} Remember what things he did to Abraham, and how he triedIsaac, and what happened to Jacob in Mesopotamia of Syria, when he keptthe sheep of Laban his mother's brother.   

{8:27} For he hath not tried us in the fire, as he did them, for theexamination of their hearts, neither hath he taken vengeance on us: butthe Lord doth scourge them that come near unto him, to admonish them.   

{8:28} Then said Ozias to her, All that thou hast spoken hast thouspoken with a good heart, and there is none that may gainsay thy words.   

{8:29} For this is not the first day wherein thy wisdom ismanifested; but from the beginning of thy days all the people haveknown thy understanding, because the disposition of thine heart is good.   

{8:30} But the people were very thirsty, and compelled us to do untothem as we have spoken, and to bring an oath upon ourselves, which wewill not break.   

{8:31} Therefore now pray thou for us, because thou art a godlywoman, and the Lord will send us rain to fill our cisterns, and weshall faint no more.   

{8:32} Then said Judith unto them, Hear me, and I will do a thing,which shall go throughout all generations to the children of our nation.   

{8:33} Ye shall stand this night in the gate, and I will go forthwith my waitingwoman: and within the days that ye have promised todeliver the city to our enemies the Lord will visit Israel by mine hand.   

{8:34} But enquire not ye of mine act: for I will not declare itunto you, till the things be finished that I do.   

{8:35} Then said Ozias and the princes unto her, Go in peace, andthe Lord God be before thee, to take vengeance on our enemies.   

{8:36} So they returned from the tent, and went to their wards.   

{9:1} Judith fell upon her face, and put ashes upon her head, anduncovered the sackcloth wherewith she was clothed; and about the timethat the incense of that evening was offered in Jerusalem in the houseof the Lord Judith cried with a loud voice, and said,   

{9:2} O Lord God of my father Simeon, to whom thou gavest a sword totake vengeance of the strangers, who loosened the girdle of a maid todefile her, and discovered the thigh to her shame, and polluted hervirginity to her reproach; for thou saidst, It shall not be so; and yetthey did so:   

{9:3} Wherefore thou gavest their rulers to be slain, so that theydyed their bed in blood, being deceived, and smotest the servants withtheir lords, and the lords upon their thrones;   

{9:4} And hast given their wives for a prey, and their daughters tobe captives, and all their spoils to be divided among thy dearchildren; which were moved with thy zeal, and abhorred the pollution oftheir blood, and called upon thee for aid: O God, O my God, hear mealso a widow.   

{9:5} For thou hast wrought not only those things, but also thethings which fell out before, and which ensued after; thou hast thoughtupon the things which are now, and which are to come.   

{9:6} Yea, what things thou didst determine were ready at hand, andsaid, Lo, we are here: for all thy ways are prepared, and thy judgmentsare in thy foreknowledge.   

{9:7} For, behold, the Assyrians are multiplied in their power; theyare exalted with horse and man; they glory in the strength of theirfootmen; they trust in shield, and spear, and bow, and sling; and knownot that thou art the Lord that breakest the battles: the Lord is thyname.   

{9:8} Throw down their strength in thy power, and bring down theirforce in thy wrath: for they have purposed to defile thy sanctuary, andto pollute the tabernacle where thy glorious name resteth and to castdown with sword the horn of thy altar.   

{9:9} Behold their pride, and send thy wrath upon their heads: giveinto mine hand, which am a widow, the power that I have conceived.   

{9:10} Smite by the deceit of my lips the servant with the prince,and the prince with the servant: break down their stateliness by thehand of a woman.   

{9:11} For thy power standeth not in multitude nor thy might instrong men: for thou art a God of the afflicted, an helper of theoppressed, an upholder of the weak, a protector of the forlorn, asaviour of them that are without hope.   

{9:12} I pray thee, I pray thee, O God of my father, and God of theinheritance of Israel, Lord of the heavens and earth, Creator of thewaters, king of every creature, hear thou my prayer:   

{9:13} And make my speech and deceit to be their wound and stripe,who have purposed cruel things against thy covenant, and thy hallowedhouse, and against the top of Sion, and against the house of thepossession of thy children.   

{9:14} And make every nation and tribe to acknowledge that thou artthe God of all power and might, and that there is none other thatprotecteth the people of Israel but thou.   

{10:1} Now after that she had ceased to cry unto the God of Israel,and bad made an end of all these words.   

{10:2} She rose where she had fallen down, and called her maid, andwent down into the house in the which she abode in the sabbath days,and in her feast days,   

{10:3} And pulled off the sackcloth which she had on, and put offthe garments of her widowhood, and washed her body all over with water,and anointed herself with precious ointment, and braided the hair ofher head, and put on a tire upon it, and put on her garments ofgladness, wherewith she was clad during the life of Manasses herhusband.   

{10:4} And she took sandals upon her feet, and put about her herbracelets, and her chains, and her rings, and her earrings, and all herornaments, and decked herself bravely, to allure the eyes of all menthat should see her.   

{10:5} Then she gave her maid a bottle of wine, and a cruse of oil,and filled a bag with parched corn, and lumps of figs, and with finebread; so she folded all these things together, and laid them upon her.   

{10:6} Thus they went forth to the gate of the city of Bethulia, andfound standing there Ozias and the ancients of the city, Chabris andCharmis.   

{10:7} And when they saw her, that her countenance was altered, andher apparel was changed, they wondered at her beauty very greatly, andsaid unto her.   

{10:8} The God, the God of our fathers give thee favour, andaccomplish thine enterprizes to the glory of the children of Israel,and to the exaltation of Jerusalem. Then they worshipped God.   

{10:9} And she said unto them, Command the gates of the city to beopened unto me, that I may go forth to accomplish the things whereof yehave spoken with me. So they commanded the young men to open unto her,as she had spoken.   

{10:10} And when they had done so, Judith went out, she, and hermaid with her; and the men of the city looked after her, until she wasgone down the mountain, and till she had passed the valley, and couldsee her no more.   

{10:11} Thus they went straight forth in the valley: and the firstwatch of the Assyrians met her,   

{10:12} And took her, and asked her, Of what people art thou? andwhence comest thou? and whither goest thou? And she said, I am a womanof the Hebrews, and am fled from them: for they shall be given you tobe consumed:   

{10:13} And I am coming before Holofernes the chief captain of yourarmy, to declare words of truth; and I will shew him a way, whereby heshall go, and win all the hill country, without losing the body or lifeof any one of his men.   

{10:14} Now when the men heard her words, and beheld hercountenance, they wondered greatly at her beauty, and said unto her,   

{10:15} Thou hast saved thy life, in that thou hast hasted to comedown to the presence of our lord: now therefore come to his tent, andsome of us shall conduct thee, until they have delivered thee to hishands.   

{10:16} And when thou standest before him, be not afraid in thineheart, but shew unto him according to thy word; and he will entreatthee well.   

{10:17} Then they chose out of them an hundred men to accompany herand her maid; and they brought her to the tent of Holofernes.   

{10:18} Then was there a concourse throughout all the camp: for hercoming was noised among the tents, and they came about her, as shestood without the tent of Holofernes, till they told him of her.   

{10:19} And they wondered at her beauty, and admired the children ofIsrael because of her, and every one said to his neighbour, Who woulddespise this people, that have among them such women? surely it is notgood that one man of them be left who being let go might deceive thewhole earth.   

{10:20} And they that lay near Holofernes went out, and all hisservants and they brought her into the tent.   

{10:21} Now Holofernes rested upon his bed under a canopy, which waswoven with purple, and gold, and emeralds, and precious stones.   

{10:22} So they shewed him of her; and he came out before his tentwith silver lamps going before him.   

{10:23} And when Judith was come before him and his servants theyall marvelled at the beauty of her countenance; and she fell down uponher face, and did reverence unto him: and his servants took her up.   

{11:1} Then said Holofernes unto her, Woman, be of good comfort,fear not in thine heart: for I never hurt any that was willing to serveNabuchodonosor, the king of all the earth.   

{11:2} Now therefore, if thy people that dwelleth in the mountainshad not set light by me, I would not have lifted up my spear againstthem: but they have done these things to themselves.   

{11:3} But now tell me wherefore thou art fled from them, and artcome unto us: for thou art come for safeguard; be of good comfort, thoushalt live this night, and hereafter:   

{11:4} For none shall hurt thee, but entreat thee well, as they dothe servants of king Nabuchodonosor my lord.   

{11:5} Then Judith said unto him, Receive the words of thy servant,and suffer thine handmaid to speak in thy presence, and I will declareno lie to my lord this night.   

{11:6} And if thou wilt follow the words of thine handmaid, God willbring the thing perfectly to pass by thee; and my lord shall not failof his purposes.   

{11:7} As Nabuchodonosor king of all the earth liveth, and as hispower liveth, who hath sent thee for the upholding of every livingthing: for not only men shall serve him by thee, but also the beasts ofthe field, and the cattle, and the fowls of the air, shall live by thypower under Nabuchodonosor and all his house.   

{11:8} For we have heard of thy wisdom and thy policies, and it isreported in all the earth, that thou only art excellent in all thekingdom, and mighty in knowledge, and wonderful in feats of war.   

{11:9} Now as concerning the matter, which Achior did speak in thycouncil, we have heard his words; for the men of Bethulia saved him,and he declared unto them all that he had spoken unto thee.   

{11:10} Therefore, O lord and governor, respect not his word; butlay it up in thine heart, for it is true: for our nation shall not bepunished, neither can sword prevail against them, except they sinagainst their God.   

{11:11} And now, that my lord be not defeated and frustrate of hispurpose, even death is now fallen upon them, and their sin hathovertaken them, wherewith they will provoke their God to angerwhensoever they shall do that which is not fit to be done:   

{11:12} For their victuals fail them, and all their water is scant,and they have determined to lay hands upon their cattle, and purposedto consume all those things, that God hath forbidden them to eat by hislaws:   

{11:13} And are resolved to spend the firstfruits of the the tenthsof wine and oil, which they had sanctified, and reserved for thepriests that serve in Jerusalem before the face of our God; the whichthings it is not lawful for any of the people so much as to touch withtheir hands.   

{11:14} For they have sent some to Jerusalem, because they also thatdwell there have done the like, to bring them a licence from the senate.   

{11:15} Now when they shall bring them word, they will forthwith doit, and they shall be given to thee to be destroyed the same day.   

{11:16} Wherefore I thine handmaid, knowing all this, am fled fromtheir presence; and God hath sent me to work things with thee, whereatall the earth shall be astonished, and whosoever shall hear it.   

{11:17} For thy servant is religious, and serveth the God of heavenday and night: now therefore, my lord, I will remain with thee, and thyservant will go out by night into the valley, and I will pray unto God,and he will tell me when they have committed their sins:   

{11:18} And I will come and shew it unto thee: then thou shalt goforth with all thine army, and there shall be none of them that shallresist thee.   

{11:19} And I will lead thee through the midst of Judea, until thoucome before Jerusalem; and I will set thy throne in the midst thereof;and thou shalt drive them as sheep that have no shepherd, and a dogshall not so much as open his mouth at thee: for these things were toldme according to my foreknowledge, and they were declared unto me, and Iam sent to tell thee.   

{11:20} Then her words pleased Holofernes and all his servants; andthey marvelled at her wisdom, and said,   

{11:21} There is not such a woman from one end of the earth to theother, both for beauty of face, and wisdom of words.   

{11:22} Likewise Holofernes said unto her. God hath done well tosend thee before the people, that strength might be in our hands anddestruction upon them that lightly regard my lord.   

{11:23} And now thou art both beautiful in thy countenance, andwitty in thy words: surely if thou do as thou hast spoken thy God shallbe my God, and thou shalt dwell in the house of king Nabuchodonosor,and shalt be renowned through the whole earth.   

{12:1} Then he commanded to bring her in where his plate was set;and bade that they should prepare for her of his own meats, and thatshe should drink of his own wine.   

{12:2} And Judith said, I will not eat thereof, lest there be anoffence: but provision shall be made for me of the things that I havebrought.   

{12:3} Then Holofernes said unto her, If thy provision should fail,how should we give thee the like? for there be none with us of thynation.   

{12:4} Then said Judith unto him As thy soul liveth, my lord, thinehandmaid shall not spend those things that I have, before the Lord workby mine hand the things that he hath determined.   

{12:5} Then the servants of Holofernes brought her into the tent,and she slept till midnight, and she arose when it was toward themorning watch,   

{12:6} And sent to Holofernes, saving, Let my lord now command thatthine handmaid may go forth unto prayer.   

{12:7} Then Holofernes commanded his guard that they should not stayher: thus she abode in the camp three days, and went out in the nightinto the valley of Bethulia, and washed herself in a fountain of waterby the camp.   

{12:8} And when she came out, she besought the Lord God of Israel todirect her way to the raising up of the children of her people.   

{12:9} So she came in clean, and remained in the tent, until she dideat her meat at evening.   

{12:10} And in the fourth day Holofernes made a feast to his ownservants only, and called none of the officers to the banquet.   

{12:11} Then said he to Bagoas the eunuch, who had charge over allthat he had, Go now, and persuade this Hebrew woman which is with thee,that she come unto us, and eat and drink with us.   

{12:12} For, lo, it will be a shame for our person, if we shall letsuch a woman go, not having had her company; for if we draw her notunto us, she will laugh us to scorn.   

{12:13} Then went Bagoas from the presence of Holofernes, and cameto her, and he said, Let not this fair damsel fear to come to my lord,and to be honoured in his presence, and drink wine, and be merry withus and be made this day as one of the daughters of the Assyrians, whichserve in the house of Nabuchodonosor.   

{12:14} Then said Judith unto him, Who am I now, that I shouldgainsay my lord? surely whatsoever pleaseth him I will do speedily, andit shall be my joy unto the day of my death.   

{12:15} So she arose, and decked herself with her apparel and allher woman's attire, and her maid went and laid soft skins on the groundfor her over against Holofernes, which she had received of Bagoas farher daily use, that she might sit and eat upon them.   

{12:16} Now when Judith came in and sat down, Holofernes his heartwas ravished with her, and his mind was moved, and he desired greatlyher company; for he waited a time to deceive her, from the day that hehad seen her.   

{12:17} Then said Holofernes unto her, Drink now, and be merry withus.   

{12:18} So Judith said, I will drink now, my lord, because my lifeis magnified in me this day more than all the days since I was born.   

{12:19} Then she took and ate and drank before him what her maid hadprepared.   

{12:20} And Holofernes took great delight in her, and drank morewine than he had drunk at any time in one day since he was born.   

{13:1} Now when the evening was come, his servants made haste todepart, and Bagoas shut his tent without, and dismissed the waitersfrom the presence of his lord; and they went to their beds: for theywere all weary, because the feast had been long.   

{13:2} And Judith was left along in the tent, and Holofernes lyingalong upon his bed: for he was filled with wine.   

{13:3} Now Judith had commanded her maid to stand without herbedchamber, and to wait for her. coming forth, as she did daily: forshe said she would go forth to her prayers, and she spake to Bagoasaccording to the same purpose.   

{13:4} So all went forth and none was left in the bedchamber,neither little nor great. Then Judith, standing by his bed, said in herheart, O Lord God of all power, look at this present upon the works ofmine hands for the exaltation of Jerusalem.   

{13:5} For now is the time to help thine inheritance, and to executethine enterprizes to the destruction of the enemies which are risenagainst us.   

{13:6} Then she came to the pillar of the bed, which was atHolofernes' head, and took down his fauchion from thence,   

{13:7} And approached to his bed, and took hold of the hair of hishead, and said, Strengthen me, O Lord God of Israel, this day.   

{13:8} And she smote twice upon his neck with all her might, and shetook away his head from him.   

{13:9} And tumbled his body down from the bed, and pulled down thecanopy from the pillars; and anon after she went forth, and gaveHolofernes his head to her maid;   

{13:10} And she put it in her bag of meat: so they twain wenttogether according to their custom unto prayer: and when they passedthe camp, they compassed the valley, and went up the mountain ofBethulia, and came to the gates thereof.   

{13:11} Then said Judith afar off, to the watchmen at the gate,Open, open now the gate: God, even our God, is with us, to shew hispower yet in Jerusalem, and his forces against the enemy, as he hatheven done this day.   

{13:12} Now when the men of her city heard her voice, they madehaste to go down to the gate of their city, and they called the eldersof the city.   

{13:13} And then they ran all together, both small and great, for itwas strange unto them that she was come: so they opened the gate, andreceived them, and made a fire for a light, and stood round about them.   

{13:14} Then she said to them with a loud voice, Praise, praise God,praise God, I say, for he hath not taken away his mercy from the houseof Israel, but hath destroyed our enemies by mine hands this night.   

{13:15} So she took the head out of the bag, and shewed it, and saidunto them, behold the head of Holofernes, the chief captain of the armyof Assur, and behold the canopy, wherein he did lie in his drunkenness;and the Lord hath smitten him by the hand of a woman.   

{13:16} As the Lord liveth, who hath kept me in my way that I went,my countenance hath deceived him to his destruction, and yet hath henot committed sin with me, to defile and shame me.   

{13:17} Then all the people were wonderfully astonished, and bowedthemselves and worshipped God, and said with one accord, Blessed bethou, O our God, which hast this day brought to nought the enemies ofthy people.   

{13:18} Then said Ozias unto her, O daughter, blessed art thou ofthe most high God above all the women upon the earth; and blessed bethe Lord God, which hath created the heavens and the earth, which hathdirected thee to the cutting off of the head of the chief of ourenemies.   

{13:19} For this thy confidence shall not depart from the heart ofmen, which remember the power of God for ever.   

{13:20} And God turn these things to thee for a perpetual praise, tovisit thee in good things because thou hast not spared thy life for theaffliction of our nation, but hast revenged our ruin, walking astraight way before our God. And all the people said; So be it, so beit.   

{14:1} Then said Judith unto them, Hear me now, my brethren, andtake this head, and hang it upon the highest place of your walls.   

{14:2} And so soon as the morning shall appear, and the sun shallcome forth upon the earth, take ye every one his weapons, and go forthevery valiant man out of the city, and set ye a captain over them, asthough ye would go down into the field toward the watch of theAssyrians; but go not down.   

{14:3} Then they shall take their armour, and shall go into theircamp, and raise up the captains of the army of Assur, and shall run tothe tent of Holofernes, but shall not find him: then fear shall fallupon them, and they shall flee before your face.   

{14:4} So ye, and all that inhabit the coast of Israel, shall pursuethem, and overthrow them as they go.   

{14:5} But before ye do these things, call me Achior the Ammonite,that he may see and know him that despised the house of Israel, andthat sent him to us as it were to his death.   

{14:6} Then they called Achior out of the house of Ozias; and whenhe was come, and saw the head of Holofernes in a man's hand in theassembly of the people, he fell down on his face, and his spirit failed.   

{14:7} But when they had recovered him, he fell at Judith's feet,and reverenced her, and said, Blessed art thou in all the tabernaclesof Juda, and in all nations, which hearing thy name shall be astonished.   

{14:8} Now therefore tell me all the things that thou hast done inthese days. Then Judith declared unto him in the midst of the peopleall that she had done, from the day that she went forth until that hourshe spake unto them.   

{14:9} And when she had left off speaking, the people shouted with aloud voice, and made a joyful noise in their city.   

{14:10} And when Achior had seen all that the God of Israel haddone, he believed in God greatly, and circumcised the flesh of hisforeskin, and was joined unto the house of Israel unto this day.   

{14:11} And as soon as the morning arose, they hanged the head ofHolofernes upon the wall, and every man took his weapons, and they wentforth by bands unto the straits of the mountain.   

{14:12} But when the Assyrians saw them, they sent to their leaders,which came to their captains and tribunes, and to every one of theirrulers.   

{14:13} So they came to Holofernes' tent, and said to him that hadthe charge of all his things, Waken now our lord: for the slaves havebeen bold to come down against us to battle, that they may be utterlydestroyed.   

{14:14} Then went in Bagoas, and knocked at the door of the tent;for he thought that he had slept with Judith.   

{14:15} But because none answered, he opened it, and went into thebedchamber, and found him cast upon the floor dead, and his head wastaken from him.   

{14:16} Therefore he cried with a loud voice, with weeping, andsighing, and a mighty cry, and rent his garments.   

{14:17} After he went into the tent where Judith lodged: and when hefound her not, he leaped out to the people, and cried,   

{14:18} These slaves have dealt treacherously; one woman of theHebrews hath brought shame upon the house of king Nabuchodonosor: for,behold, Holofernes lieth upon the ground without a head.   

{14:19} When the captains of the Assyrians' army heard these words,they rent their coats and their minds were wonderfully troubled, andthere was a cry and a very great noise throughout the camp.   

{15:1} And when they that were in the tents heard, they wereastonished at the thing that was done.   

{15:2} And fear and trembling fell upon them, so that there was noman that durst abide in the sight of his neighbour, but rushing out alltogether, they fled into every way of the plain, and of the hillcountry.   

{15:3} They also that had camped in the mountains round aboutBethulia fled away. Then the children of Israel, every one that was awarrior among them, rushed out upon them.   

{15:4} Then sent Ozias to Betomasthem, and to Bebai, and Chobai, andCola and to all the coasts of Israel, such as should tell the thingsthat were done, and that all should rush forth upon their enemies todestroy them.   

{15:5} Now when the children of Israel heard it, they all fell uponthem with one consent, and slew them unto Chobai: likewise also theythat came from Jerusalem, and from all the hill country, (for men hadtold them what things were done in the camp of their enemies) and theythat were in Galaad, and in Galilee, chased them with a greatslaughter, until they were past Damascus and the borders thereof.   

{15:6} And the residue that dwelt at Bethulia, fell upon the camp ofAssur, and spoiled them, and were greatly enriched.   

{15:7} And the children of Israel that returned from the slaughterhad that which remained; and the villages and the cities, that were inthe mountains and in the plain, gat many spoils: for the multitude wasvery great.   

{15:8} Then Joacim the high priest, and the ancients of the childrenof Israel that dwelt in Jerusalem, came to behold the good things thatGod had shewed to Israel, and to see Judith, and to salute her.   

{15:9} And when they came unto her, they blessed her with oneaccord, and said unto her, Thou art the exaltation of Jerusalem, thouart the great glory of Israel, thou art the great rejoicing of ournation:   

{15:10} Thou hast done all these things by thine hand: thou hastdone much good to Israel, and God is pleased therewith: blessed be thouof the Almighty Lord for evermore. And all the people said, So be it.   

{15:11} And the people spoiled the camp the space of thirty days:and they gave unto Judith Holofernes his tent, and all his plate, andbeds, and vessels, and all his stuff: and she took it and laid it onher mule; and made ready her carts, and laid them thereon.   

{15:12} Then all the women of Israel ran together to see her, andblessed her, and made a dance among them for her: and she took branchesin her hand, and gave also to the women that were with her.   

{15:13} And they put a garland of olive upon her and her maid thatwas with her, and she went before all the people in the dance, leadingall the women: and all the men of Israel followed in their armour withgarlands, and with songs in their mouths.   

{16:1} Then Judith began to sing this thanksgiving in all Israel,and all the people sang after her this song of praise.   

{16:2} And Judith said, Begin unto my God with timbrels, sing untomy Lord with cymbals: tune unto him a new psalm: exalt him, and callupon his name.   

{16:3} For God breaketh the battles: for among the camps in themidst of the people he hath delivered me out of the hands of them thatpersecuted me.   

{16:4} Assur came out of the mountains from the north, he came withten thousands of his army, the multitude whereof stopped the torrents,and their horsemen have covered the hills.   

{16:5} He bragged that he would burn up my borders, and kill myyoung men with the sword, and dash the sucking children against theground, and make mine infants as a prey, and my virgins as a spoil.   

{16:6} But the Almighty Lord hath disappointed them by the hand of awoman.   

{16:7} For the mighty one did not fall by the young men, neither didthe sons of the Titans smite him, nor high giants set upon him: butJudith the daughter of Merari weakened him with the beauty of hercountenance.   

{16:8} For she put off the garment of her widowhood for theexaltation of those that were oppressed in Israel, and anointed herface with ointment, and bound her hair in a tire, and took a linengarment to deceive him.   

{16:9} Her sandals ravished his eyes, her beauty took his mindprisoner, and the fauchion passed through his neck.   

{16:10} The Persians quaked at her boldness, and the Medes weredaunted at her hardiness.   

{16:11} Then my afflicted shouted for joy, and my weak ones criedaloud; but they were astonished: these lifted up their voices, but theywere overthrown.   

{16:12} The sons of the damsels have pierced them through, andwounded them as fugatives' children: they perished by the battle of theLord.   

{16:13} I will sing unto the Lord a new song: O Lord, thou art greatand glorious, wonderful in strength, and invincible.   

{16:14} Let all creatures serve thee: for thou spakest, and theywere made, thou didst send forth thy spirit, and it created them, andthere is none that can resist thy voice.   

{16:15} For the mountains shall be moved from their foundations withthe waters, the rocks shall melt as wax at thy presence: yet thou artmerciful to them that fear thee.   

{16:16} For all sacrifice is too little for a sweet savour untothee, and all the fat is not sufficient for thy burnt offering: but hethat feareth the Lord is great at all times.   

{16:17} Woe to the nations that rise up against my kindred! the LordAlmighty will take vengeance of them in the day of judgment, in puttingfire and worms in their flesh; and they shall feel them, and weep forever.   

{16:18} Now as soon as they entered into Jerusalem, they worshippedthe Lord; and as soon as the people were purified, they offered theirburnt offerings, and their free offerings, and their gifts.   

{16:19} Judith also dedicated all the stuff of Holofernes, which thepeople had given her, and gave the canopy, which she had taken out ofhis bedchamber, for a gift unto the Lord.   

{16:20} So the people continued feasting in Jerusalem before thesanctuary for the space of three months and Judith remained with them.   

{16:21} After this time every one returned to his own inheritance,and Judith went to Bethulia, and remained in her own possession, andwas in her time honourable in all the country.   

{16:22} And many desired her, but none knew her all the days of herlife, after that Manasses her husband was dead, and was gathered to hispeople.   

{16:23} But she increased more and more in honour, and waxed old inher husband's house, being an hundred and five years old, and made hermaid free; so she died in Bethulia: and they buried her in the cave ofher husband Manasses.   

{16:24} And the house of Israel lamented her seven days: and beforeshe died, she did distribute her goods to all them that were nearest ofkindred to Manasses her husband, and to them that were the nearest ofher kindred.   

{16:25} And there was none that made the children of Israel any moreafraid in the days of Judith, nor a long time after her death.The Rest of the Chapters of the Book of Esther   

{10:4} Then Mardocheus said, God hath done these things.   

{10:5} For I remember a dream which I saw concerning these matters,and nothing thereof hath failed.   

{10:6} A little fountain became a river, and there was light, andthe sun, and much water: this river is Esther, whom the king married,and made queen:   

{10:7} And the two dragons are I and Aman.   

{10:8} And the nations were those that were assembled to destroy thename of the Jews:   

{10:9} And my nation is this Israel, which cried to God, and weresaved: for the Lord hath saved his people, and the Lord hath deliveredus from all those evils, and God hath wrought signs and great wonders,which have not been done among the Gentiles.   

{10:10} Therefore hath he made two lots, one for the people of God,and another for all the Gentiles.   

{10:11} And these two lots came at the hour, and time, and day ofjudgment, before God among all nations.   

{10:12} So God remembered his people, and justified his inheritance.   

{10:13} Therefore those days shall be unto them in the month Adar,the fourteenth and fifteenth day of the same month, with an assembly,and joy, and with gladness before God, according to the generations forever among his people.   

{11:1} In the fourth year of the reign of Ptolemeus and Cleopatra,Dositheus, who said he was a priest and Levite, and Ptolemeus his son,brought this epistle of Phurim, which they said was the same, and thatLysimachus the son of Ptolemeus, that was in Jerusalem, had interpretedit.   

{11:2} In the second year of the reign of Artexerxes the great, inthe first day of the month Nisan, Mardocheus the son of Jairus, the sonof Semei, the son of Cisai, of the tribe of Benjamin, had a dream;   

{11:3} Who was a Jew, and dwelt in the city of Susa, a great man,being a servitor in the king's court.   

{11:4} He was also one of the captives, which Nabuchodonosor theking of Babylon carried from Jerusalem with Jechonias king of Judea;and this was his dream:   

{11:5} Behold a noise of a tumult, with thunder, and earthquakes,and uproar in the land:   

{11:6} And, behold, two great dragons came forth ready to fight, andtheir cry was great.   

{11:7} And at their cry all nations were prepared to battle, thatthey might fight against the righteous people.   

{11:8} And lo a day of darkness and obscurity, tribulation andanguish, affliction and great uproar, upon earth.   

{11:9} And the whole righteous nation was troubled, fearing theirown evils, and were ready to perish.   

{11:10} Then they cried unto God, and upon their cry, as it werefrom a little fountain, was made a great flood, even much water.   

{11:11} The light and the sun rose up, and the lowly were exalted,and devoured the glorious.   

{11:12} Now when Mardocheus, who had seen this dream, and what Godhad determined to do, was awake, he bare this dream in mind, and untilnight by all means was desirous to know it.   

{12:1} And Mardocheus took his rest in the court with Gabatha andTharra, the two eunuchs of the king, and keepers of the palace.   

{12:2} And he heard their devices, and searched out their purposes,and learned that they were about to lay hands upon Artexerxes the king;and so he certified the king of them.   

{12:3} Then the king examined the two eunuchs, and after that theyhad confessed it, they were strangled.   

{12:4} And the king made a record of these things, and Mardocheusalso wrote thereof.   

{12:5} So the king commanded, Mardocheus to serve in the court, andfor this he rewarded him.   

{12:6} Howbeit Aman the son of Amadathus the Agagite, who was ingreat honour with the king, sought to molest Mardocheus and his peoplebecause of the two eunuchs of the king.   

{13:1} The copy of the letters was this: The great king Artexerxeswriteth these things to the princes and governours that are under himfrom India unto Ethiopia in an hundred and seven and twenty provinces.   

{13:2} After that I became lord over many nations and had dominionover the whole world, not lifted up with presumption of my authority,but carrying myself always with equity and mildness, I purposed tosettle my subjects continually in a quiet life, and making my kingdompeaceable, and open for passage to the utmost coasts, to renew peace,which is desired of all men.   

{13:3} Now when I asked my counsellors how this might be brought topass, Aman, that excelled in wisdom among us, and was approved for hisconstant good will and steadfast fidelity, and had the honour of thesecond place in the kingdom,   

{13:4} Declared unto us, that in all nations throughout the worldthere was scattered a certain malicious people, that had laws contraryto all nations, and continually despised the commandments of kings, soas the uniting of our kingdoms, honourably intended by us cannot goforward.   

{13:5} Seeing then we understand that this people alone iscontinually in opposition unto all men, differing in the strange mannerof their laws, and evil affected to our state, working all the mischiefthey can that our kingdom may not be firmly established:   

{13:6} Therefore have we commanded, that all they that are signifiedin writing unto you by Aman, who is ordained over the affairs, and isnext unto us, shall all, with their wives and children, be utterlydestroyed by the sword of their enemies, without all mercy and pity,the fourteenth day of the twelfth month Adar of this present year:   

{13:7} That they, who of old and now also are malicious, may in oneday with violence go into the grave, and so ever hereafter cause ouraffairs to be well settled, and without trouble.   

{13:8} Then Mardocheus thought upon all the works of the Lord, andmade his prayer unto him,   

{13:9} Saying, O Lord, Lord, the King Almighty: for the whole worldis in thy power, and if thou hast appointed to save Israel, there is noman that can gainsay thee:   

{13:10} For thou hast made heaven and earth, and all the wondrousthings under the heaven.   

{13:11} Thou art Lord of all things, and and there is no man thatcan resist thee, which art the Lord.   

{13:12} Thou knowest all things, and thou knowest, Lord, that it wasneither in contempt nor pride, nor for any desire of glory, that I didnot bow down to proud Aman.   

{13:13} For I could have been content with good will for thesalvation of Israel to kiss the soles of his feet.   

{13:14} But I did this, that I might not prefer the glory of manabove the glory of God: neither will I worship any but thee, O God,neither will I do it in pride.   

{13:15} And now, O Lord God and King, spare thy people: for theireyes are upon us to bring us to nought; yea, they desire to destroy theinheritance, that hath been thine from the beginning.   

{13:16} Despise not the portion, which thou hast delivered out ofEgypt for thine own self.   

{13:17} Hear my prayer, and be merciful unto thine inheritance: turnour sorrow into joy, that we may live, O Lord, and praise thy name: anddestroy not the mouths of them that praise thee, O Lord.   

{13:18} All Israel in like manner cried most earnestly unto theLord, because their death was before their eyes.   

{14:1} Queen Esther also, being in fear of death, resorted unto theLord:   

{14:2} And laid away her glorious apparel, and put on the garmentsof anguish and mourning: and instead of precious ointments, she coveredher head with ashes and dung, and she humbled her body greatly, and allthe places of her joy she filled with her torn hair.   

{14:3} And she prayed unto the Lord God of Israel, saying, O myLord, thou only art our King: help me, desolate woman, which have nohelper but thee:   

{14:4} For my danger is in mine hand.   

{14:5} From my youth up I have heard in the tribe of my family thatthou, O Lord, tookest Israel from among all people, and our fathersfrom all their predecessors, for a perpetual inheritance, and thou hastperformed whatsoever thou didst promise them.   

{14:6} And now we have sinned before thee: therefore hast thou givenus into the hands of our enemies,   

{14:7} Because we worshipped their gods: O Lord, thou art righteous.   

{14:8} Nevertheless it satisfieth them not, that we are in bittercaptivity: but they have stricken hands with their idols,   

{14:9} That they will abolish the thing that thou with thy mouthhast ordained, and destroy thine inheritance, and stop the mouth ofthem that praise thee, and quench the glory of thy house, and of thinealtar,   

{14:10} And open the mouths of the heathen to set forth the praisesof the idols, and to magnify a fleshly king for ever.   

{14:11} O Lord, give not thy sceptre unto them that be nothing, andlet them not laugh at our fall; but turn their device upon themselves,and make him an example, that hath begun this against us.   

{14:12} Remember, O Lord, make thyself known in time of ouraffliction, and give me boldness, O King of the nations, and Lord ofall power.   

{14:13} Give me eloquent speech in my mouth before the lion: turnhis heart to hate him that fighteth against us, that there may be anend of him, and of all that are likeminded to him:   

{14:14} But deliver us with thine hand, and help me that amdesolate, and which have no other help but thee.   

{14:15} Thou knowest all things, O Lord; thou knowest that I hatethe glory of the unrighteous, and abhor the bed of the uncircumcised,and of all the heathen.   

{14:16} Thou knowest my necessity: for I abhor the sign of my highestate, which is upon mine head in the days wherein I shew myself, andthat I abhor it as a menstruous rag, and that I wear it not when I amprivate by myself.   

{14:17} And that thine handmaid hath not eaten at Aman's table, andthat I have not greatly esteemed the king's feast, nor drunk the wineof the drink offerings.   

{14:18} Neither had thine handmaid any joy since the day that I wasbrought hither to this present, but in thee, O Lord God of Abraham.   

{14:19} O thou mighty God above all, hear the voice of the forlornand deliver us out of the hands of the mischievous, and deliver me outof my fear.   

{15:1} And upon the third day, when she had ended her prayers, shelaid away her mourning garments, and put on her glorious apparel.   

{15:2} And being gloriously adorned, after she had called upon God,who is the beholder and saviour of all things, she took two maids withher:   

{15:3} And upon the one she leaned, as carrying herself daintily;   

{15:4} And the other followed, bearing up her train.   

{15:5} And she was ruddy through the perfection of her beauty, andher countenance was cheerful and very amiable: but her heart was inanguish for fear.   

{15:6} Then having passed through all the doors, she stood beforethe king, who sat upon his royal throne, and was clothed with all hisrobes of majesty, all glittering with gold and precious stones; and hewas very dreadful.   

{15:7} Then lifting up his countenance that shone with majesty, helooked very fiercely upon her: and the queen fell down, and was pale,and fainted, and bowed herself upon the head of the maid that wentbefore her.   

{15:8} Then God changed the spirit of the king into mildness, who ina fear leaped from his throne, and took her in his arms, till she cameto herself again, and comforted her with loving words and said unto her,   

{15:9} Esther, what is the matter? I am thy brother, be of goodcheer:   

{15:10} Thou shalt not die, though our our commandment be general:come near.   

{15:11} And so be held up his golden sceptre, and laid it upon herneck,   

{15:12} And embraced her, and said, Speak unto me.   

{15:13} Then said she unto him, I saw thee, my lord, as an angel ofGod, and my heart was troubled for fear of thy majesty.   

{15:14} For wonderful art thou, lord, and thy countenance is full ofgrace.   

{15:15} And as she was speaking, she fell down for faintness.   

{15:16} Then the king was troubled, and all his servants comfortedher.   

{16:1} The great king Artexerxes unto the princes and governors ofan hundred and seven and twenty provinces from India unto Ethiopia, andunto all our faithful subjects, greeting.   

{16:2} Many, the more often they are honoured with the great bountyof their gracious princes, the more proud they are waxen,   

{16:3} And endeavour to hurt not our subjects only, but not beingable to bear abundance, do take in hand to practise also against thosethat do them good:   

{16:4} And take not only thankfulness away from among men, but alsolifted up with the glorious words of lewd persons, that were nevergood, they think to escape the justice of God, that seeth all thingsand hateth evil.   

{16:5} Oftentimes also fair speech of those, that are put in trustto manage their friends' affairs, hath caused many that are inauthority to be partakers of innocent blood, and hath enwrapped them inremediless calamities:   

{16:6} Beguiling with the falsehood and deceit of their lewddisposition the innocency and goodness of princes.   

{16:7} Now ye may see this, as we have declared, not so much byancient histories, as ye may, if ye search what hath been wickedly doneof late through the pestilent behaviour of them that are unworthilyplaced in authority.   

{16:8} And we must take care for the time to come, that our kingdommay be quiet and peaceable for all men,   

{16:9} Both by changing our purposes, and always judging things thatare evident with more equal proceeding.   

{16:10} For Aman, a Macedonian, the son of Amadatha, being indeed astranger from the Persian blood, and far distant from our goodness, andas a stranger received of us,   

{16:11} Had so far forth obtained the favour that we shew towardevery nation, as that he was called our father, and was continuallyhonoured of all the next person unto the king.   

{16:12} But he, not bearing his great dignity, went about to depriveus of our kingdom and life:   

{16:13} Having by manifold and cunning deceits sought of us thedestruction, as well of Mardocheus, who saved our life, and continuallyprocured our good, as also of blameless Esther, partaker of ourkingdom, with their whole nation.   

{16:14} For by these means he thought, finding us destitute offriends to have translated the kingdom of the Persians to theMacedonians.   

{16:15} But we find that the Jews, whom this wicked wretch hathdelivered to utter destruction, are no evildoers, but live by most justlaws:   

{16:16} And that they be children of the most high and most mighty,living God, who hath ordered the kingdom both unto us and to ourprogenitors in the most excellent manner.   

{16:17} Wherefore ye shall do well not to put in execution theletters sent unto you by Aman the son of Amadatha.   

{16:18} For he that was the worker of these things, is hanged at thegates of Susa with all his family: God, who ruleth all things, speedilyrendering vengeance to him according to his deserts.   

{16:19} Therefore ye shall publish the copy of this letter in allplaces, that the Jews may freely live after their own laws.   

{16:20} And ye shall aid them, that even the same day, being thethirteenth day of the twelfth month Adar, they may be avenged on them,who in the time of their affliction shall set upon them.   

{16:21} For Almighty God hath turned to joy unto them the day,wherein the chosen people should have perished.   

{16:22} Ye shall therefore among your solemn feasts keep it an highday with all feasting:   

{16:23} That both now and hereafter there may be safety to us andthe well affected Persians; but to those which do conspire against us amemorial of destruction.   

{16:24} Therefore every city and country whatsoever, which shall notdo according to these things, shall be destroyed without mercy withfire and sword, and shall be made not only unpassable for men, but alsomost hateful to wild beasts and fowls for ever.The Book of Wisdom or The Wisdom of Solomon   

{1:1} Love righteousness, ye that be judges of the earth: think ofthe Lord with a good (heart,) and in simplicity of heart seek him.   

{1:2} For he will be found of them that tempt him not; and shewethhimself unto such as do not distrust him.   

{1:3} For froward thoughts separate from God: and his power, when itis tried, reproveth the unwise.   

{1:4} For into a malicious soul wisdom shall not enter; nor dwell inthe body that is subject unto sin.   

{1:5} For the holy spirit of discipline will flee deceit, and removefrom thoughts that are without understanding, and will not abide whenunrighteousness cometh in.   

{1:6} For wisdom is a loving spirit; and will not acquit ablasphemer of his words: for God is witness of his reins, and a truebeholder of his heart, and a hearer of his tongue.   

{1:7} For the Spirit of the Lord filleth the world: and that whichcontaineth all things hath knowledge of the voice.   

{1:8} Therefore he that speaketh unrighteous things cannot be hid:neither shall vengeance, when it punisheth, pass by him.   

{1:9} For inquisition shall be made into the counsels of theungodly: and the sound of his words shall come unto the Lord for themanifestation of his wicked deeds.   

{1:10} For the ear of jealousy heareth all things: and the noise ofmurmurings is not hid.   

{1:11} Therefore beware of murmuring, which is unprofitable; andrefrain your tongue from backbiting: for there is no word so secret,that shall go for nought: and the mouth that belieth slayeth the soul.   

{1:12} Seek not death in the error of your life: and pull not uponyourselves destruction with the works of your hands.   

{1:13} For God made not death: neither hath he pleasure in thedestruction of the living.   

{1:14} For he created all things, that they might have their being:and the generations of the world were healthful; and there is no poisonof destruction in them, nor the kingdom of death upon the earth:   

{1:15} (For righteousness is immortal:)   

{1:16} But ungodly men with their works and words called it to them:for when they thought to have it their friend, they consumed to nought,and made a covenant with it, because they are worthy to take part withit.   

{2:1} For the ungodly said, reasoning with themselves, but notaright, Our life is short and tedious, and in the death of a man thereis no remedy: neither was there any man known to have returned from thegrave.   

{2:2} For we are born at all adventure: and we shall be hereafter asthough we had never been: for the breath in our nostrils is as smoke,and a little spark in the moving of our heart:   

{2:3} Which being extinguished, our body shall be turned into ashes,and our spirit shall vanish as the soft air,   

{2:4} And our name shall be forgotten in time, and no man shall haveour works in remembrance, and our life shall pass away as the trace ofa cloud, and shall be dispersed as a mist, that is driven away with thebeams of the sun, and overcome with the heat thereof.   

{2:5} For our time is a very shadow that passeth away; and after ourend there is no returning: for it is fast sealed, so that no man comethagain.   

{2:6} Come on therefore, let us enjoy the good things that arepresent: and let us speedily use the creatures like as in youth.   

{2:7} Let us fill ourselves with costly wine and ointments: and letno flower of the spring pass by us:   

{2:8} Let us crown ourselves with rosebuds, before they be withered:   

{2:9} Let none of us go without his part of our voluptuousness: letus leave tokens of our joyfulness in every place: for this is ourportion, and our lot is this.   

{2:10} Let us oppress the poor righteous man, let us not spare thewidow, nor reverence the ancient gray hairs of the aged.   

{2:11} Let our strength be the law of justice: for that which isfeeble is found to be nothing worth.   

{2:12} Therefore let us lie in wait for the righteous; because he isnot for our turn, and he is clean contrary to our doings: he upbraidethus with our offending the law, and objecteth to our infamy thetransgressings of our education.   

{2:13} He professeth to have the knowledge of God: and he callethhimself the child of the Lord.   

{2:14} He was made to reprove our thoughts.   

{2:15} He is grievous unto us even to behold: for his life is notlike other men's, his ways are of another fashion.   

{2:16} We are esteemed of him as counterfeits: he abstaineth fromour ways as from filthiness: he pronounceth the end of the just to beblessed, and maketh his boast that God is his father.   

{2:17} Let us see if his words be true: and let us prove what shallhappen in the end of him.   

{2:18} For if the just man be the son of God, he will help him, anddeliver him from the hand of his enemies.   

{2:19} Let us examine him with despitefulness and torture, that wemay know his meekness, and prove his patience.   

{2:20} Let us condemn him with a shameful death: for by his ownsaying he shall be respected.   

{2:21} Such things they did imagine, and were deceived: for theirown wickedness hath blinded them.   

{2:22} As for the mysteries of God, they kn ew them not: neitherhoped they for the wages of righteousness, nor discerned a reward forblameless souls.   

{2:23} For God created man to be immortal, and made him to be animage of his own eternity.   

{2:24} Nevertheless through envy of the devil came death into theworld: and they that do hold of his side do find it.   

{3:1} But the souls of the righteous are in the hand of God, andthere shall no torment touch them.   

{3:2} In the sight of the unwise they seemed to die: and theirdeparture is taken for misery,   

{3:3} And their going from us to be utter destruction: but they arein peace.   

{3:4} For though they be punished in the sight of men, yet is theirhope full of immortality.   

{3:5} And having been a little chastised, they shall be greatlyrewarded: for God proved them, and found them worthy for himself.   

{3:6} As gold in the furnace hath he tried them, and received themas a burnt offering.   

{3:7} And in the time of their visitation they shall shine, and runto and fro like sparks among the stubble.   

{3:8} They shall judge the nations, and have dominion over thepeople, and their Lord shall reign for ever.   

{3:9} They that put their trust in him shall understand the truth:and such as be faithful in love shall abide with him: for grace andmercy is to his saints, and he hath care for his elect.   

{3:10} But the ungodly shall be punished according to their ownimaginations, which have neglected the righteous, and forsaken the Lord.   

{3:11} For whoso despiseth wisdom and nurture, he is miserable, andtheir hope is vain, their labours unfruitful, and their worksunprofitable:   

{3:12} Their wives are foolish, and their children wicked:   

{3:13} Their offspring is cursed. Wherefore blessed is the barrenthat is undefiled, which hath not known the sinful bed: she shall havefruit in the visitation of souls.   

{3:14} And blessed is the eunuch, which with his hands hath wroughtno iniquity, nor imagined wicked things against God: for unto him shallbe given the special gift of faith, and an inheritance in the temple ofthe Lord more acceptable to his mind.   

{3:15} For glorious is the fruit of good labours: and the root ofwisdom shall never fall away.   

{3:16} As for the children of adulterers, they shall not come totheir perfection, and the seed of an unrighteous bed shall be rootedout.   

{3:17} For though they live long, yet shall they be nothingregarded: and their last age shall be without honour.   

{3:18} Or, if they die quickly, they have no hope, neither comfortin the day of trial.   

{3:19} For horrible is the end of the unrighteous generation.   

{4:1} Better it is to have no children, and to have virtue: for thememorial thereof is immortal: because it is known with God, and withmen.   

{4:2} When it is present, men take example at it; and when it isgone, they desire it: it weareth a crown, and triumpheth for ever,having gotten the victory, striving for undefiled rewards.   

{4:3} But the multiplying brood of the ungodly shall not thrive, nortake deep rooting from bastard slips, nor lay any fast foundation.   

{4:4} For though they flourish in branches for a time; yet standingnot last, they shall be shaken with the wind, and through the force ofwinds they shall be rooted out.   

{4:5} The imperfect branches shall be broken off, their fruitunprofitable, not ripe to eat, yea, meet for nothing.   

{4:6} For children begotten of unlawful beds are witnesses ofwickedness against their parents in their trial.   

{4:7} But though the righteous be prevented with death, yet shall hebe in rest.   

{4:8} For honourable age is not that which standeth in length oftime, nor that is measured by number of years.   

{4:9} But wisdom is the gray hair unto men, and an unspotted life isold age.   

{4:10} He pleased God, and was beloved of him: so that living amongsinners he was translated.   

{4:11} Yea speedily was he taken away, lest that wickedness shouldalter his understanding, or deceit beguile his soul.   

{4:12} For the bewitching of naughtiness doth obscure things thatare honest; and the wandering of concupiscence doth undermine thesimple mind.   

{4:13} He, being made perfect in a short time, fulfilled a long time:   

{4:14} For his soul pleased the Lord: therefore hasted he to takehim away from among the wicked.   

{4:15} This the people saw, and understood it not, neither laid theyup this in their minds, That his grace and mercy is with his saints,and that he hath respect unto his chosen.   

{4:16} Thus the righteous that is dead shall condemn the ungodlywhich are living; and youth that is soon perfected the many years andold age of the unrighteous.   

{4:17} For they shall see the end of the wise, and shall notunderstand what God in his counsel hath decreed of him, and to what endthe Lord hath set him in safety.   

{4:18} They shall see him, and despise him; but God shall laugh themto scorn: and they shall hereafter be a vile carcase, and a reproachamong the dead for evermore.   

{4:19} For he shall rend them, and cast them down headlong, thatthey shall be speechless; and he shall shake them from the foundation;and they shall be utterly laid waste, and be in sorrow; and theirmemorial shall perish.   

{4:20} And when they cast up the accounts of their sins, they shallcome with fear: and their own iniquities shall convince them to theirface.   

{5:1} Then shall the righteous man stand in great boldness beforethe face of such as have afflicted him, and made no account of hislabours.   

{5:2} When they see it, they shall be troubled with terrible fear,and shall be amazed at the strangeness of his salvation, so far beyondall that they looked for.   

{5:3} And they repenting and groaning for anguish of spirit shallsay within themselves, This was he, whom we had sometimes in derision,and a proverb of reproach:   

{5:4} We fools accounted his life madness, and his end to be withouthonour:   

{5:5} How is he numbered among the children of God, and his lot isamong the saints!   

{5:6} Therefore have we erred from the way of truth, and the lightof righteousness hath not shined unto us, and the sun of righteousnessrose not upon us.   

{5:7} We wearied ourselves in the way of wickedness and destruction:yea, we have gone through deserts, where there lay no way: but as forthe way of the Lord, we have not known it.   

{5:8} What hath pride profited us? or what good hath riches with ourvaunting brought us?   

{5:9} All those things are passed away like a shadow, and as a postthat hasted by;   

{5:10} And as a ship that passeth over the waves of the water, whichwhen it is gone by, the trace thereof cannot be found, neither thepathway of the keel in the waves;   

{5:11} Or as when a bird hath flown through the air, there is notoken of her way to be found, but the light air being beaten with thestroke of her wings and parted with the violent noise and motion ofthem, is passed through, and therein afterwards no sign where she wentis to be found;   

{5:12} Or like as when an arrow is shot at a mark, it parteth theair, which immediately cometh together again, so that a man cannot knowwhere it went through:   

{5:13} Even so we in like manner, as soon as we were born, began todraw to our end, and had no sign of virtue to shew; but were consumedin our own wickedness.   

{5:14} For the hope of the Godly is like dust that is blown awaywith the wind; like a thin froth that is driven away with the storm;like as the smoke which is dispersed here and there with a tempest, andpasseth away as the remembrance of a guest that tarrieth but a day.   

{5:15} But the righteous live for evermore; their reward also iswith the Lord, and the care of them is with the most High.   

{5:16} Therefore shall they receive a glorious kingdom, and abeautiful crown from the Lord's hand: for with his right hand shall hecover them, and with his arm shall he protect them.   

{5:17} He shall take to him his jealousy for complete armour, andmake the creature his weapon for the revenge of his enemies.   

{5:18} He shall put on righteousness as a breastplate, and truejudgment instead of an helmet.   

{5:19} He shall take holiness for an invincible shield.   

{5:20} His severe wrath shall he sharpen for a sword, and the worldshall fight with him against the unwise.   

{5:21} Then shall the right aiming thunderbolts go abroad; and fromthe clouds, as from a well drawn bow, shall they fly to the mark.   

{5:22} And hailstones full of wrath shall be cast as out of a stonebow, and the water of the sea shall rage against them, and the floodsshall cruelly drown them.   

{5:23} Yea, a mighty wind shall stand up against them, and like astorm shall blow them away: thus iniquity shall lay waste the wholeearth, and ill dealing shall overthrow the thrones of the mighty.   

{6:1} Hear therefore, O ye kings, and understand; learn, ye that bejudges of the ends of the earth.   

{6:2} Give ear, ye that rule the people, and glory in the multitudeof nations.   

{6:3} For power is given you of the Lord, and sovereignty from theHighest, who shall try your works, and search out your counsels.   

{6:4} Because, being ministers of his kingdom, ye have not judgedaright, nor kept the law, nor walked after the counsel of God;   

{6:5} Horribly and speedily shall he come upon you: for a sharpjudgment shall be to them that be in high places.   

{6:6} For mercy will soon pardon the meanest: but mighty men shallbe mightily tormented.   

{6:7} For he which is Lord over all shall fear no man's person,neither shall he stand in awe of any man's greatness: for he hath madethe small and great, and careth for all alike.   

{6:8} But a sore trial shall come upon the mighty.   

{6:9} Unto you therefore, O kings, do I speak, that ye may learnwisdom, and not fall away.   

{6:10} For they that keep holiness holily shall be judged holy: andthey that have learned such things shall find what to answer.   

{6:11} Wherefore set your affection upon my words; desire them, andye shall be instructed.   

{6:12} Wisdom is glorious, and never fadeth away: yea, she is easilyseen of them that love her, and found of such as seek her.   

{6:13} She preventeth them that desire her, in making herself firstknown unto them.   

{6:14} Whoso seeketh her early shall have no great travail: for heshall find her sitting at his doors.   

{6:15} To think therefore upon her is perfection of wisdom: andwhoso watcheth for her shall quickly be without care.   

{6:16} For she goeth about seeking such as are worthy of her,sheweth herself favourably unto them in the ways, and meeteth them inevery thought.   

{6:17} For the very true beginning of her is the desire ofdiscipline; and the care of discipline is love;   

{6:18} And love is the keeping of her laws; and the giving heed untoher laws is the assurance of incorruption;   

{6:19} And incorruption maketh us near unto God:   

{6:20} Therefore the desire of wisdom bringeth to a kingdom.   

{6:21} If your delight be then in thrones and sceptres, O ye kingsof the people, honour wisdom, that ye may reign for evermore.   

{6:22} As for wisdom, what she is, and how she came up, I will tellyou, and will not hide mysteries from you: but will seek her out fromthe beginning of her nativity, and bring the knowledge of her intolight, and will not pass over the truth.   

{6:23} Neither will I go with consuming envy; for such a man shallhave no fellowship with wisdom.   

{6:24} But the multitude of the wise is the welfare of the world:and a wise king is the upholding of the people.   

{6:25} Receive therefore instruction through my words, and it shalldo you good.   

{7:1} I myself also am a mortal man, like to all, and the offspringof him that was first made of the earth,   

{7:2} And in my mother's womb was fashioned to be flesh in the timeof ten months, being compacted in blood, of the seed of man, and thepleasure that came with sleep.   

{7:3} And when I was born, I drew in the common air, and fell uponthe earth, which is of like nature, and the first voice which I utteredwas crying, as all others do.   

{7:4} I was nursed in swaddling clothes, and that with cares.   

{7:5} For there is no king that had any other beginning of birth.   

{7:6} For all men have one entrance into life, and the like goingout.   

{7:7} Wherefore I prayed, and understanding was given me: I calledupon God, and the spirit of wisdom came to me.   

{7:8} I preferred her before sceptres and thrones, and esteemedriches nothing in comparison of her.   

{7:9} Neither compared I unto her any precious stone, because allgold in respect of her is as a little sand, and silver shall be countedas clay before her.   

{7:10} I loved her above health and beauty, and chose to have herinstead of light: for the light that cometh from her never goeth out.   

{7:11} All good things together came to me with her, and innumerableriches in her hands.   

{7:12} And I rejoiced in them all, because wisdom goeth before them:and I knew not that she was the mother of them.   

{7:13} I learned diligently, and do communicate her liberally: I donot hide her riches.   

{7:14} For she is a treasure unto men that never faileth: which theythat use become the friends of God, being commended for the gifts thatcome from learning.   

{7:15} God hath granted me to speak as I would, and to conceive asis meet for the things that are given me: because it is he that leadethunto wisdom, and directeth the wise.   

{7:16} For in his hand are both we and our words; all wisdom also,and knowledge of workmanship.   

{7:17} For he hath given me certain knowledge of the things thatare, namely, to know how the world was made, and the operation of theelements:   

{7:18} The beginning, ending, and midst of the times: thealterations of the turning of the sun, and the change of seasons:   

{7:19} The circuits of years, and the positions of stars:   

{7:20} The natures of living creatures, and the furies of wildbeasts: the violence of winds, and the reasonings of men: thediversities of plants and the virtues of roots:   

{7:21} And all such things as are either secret or manifest, them Iknow.   

{7:22} For wisdom, which is the worker of all things, taught me: forin her is an understanding spirit holy, one only, manifold, subtil,lively, clear, undefiled, plain, not subject to hurt, loving the thingthat is good quick, which cannot be letted, ready to do good,   

{7:23} Kind to man, steadfast, sure, free from care, having allpower, overseeing all things, and going through all understanding,pure, and most subtil, spirits.   

{7:24} For wisdom is more moving than any motion: she passeth andgoeth through all things by reason of her pureness.   

{7:25} For she is the breath of the power of God, and a pureinfluence flowing from the glory of the Almighty: therefore can nodefiled thing fall into her.   

{7:26} For she is the brightness of the everlasting light, theunspotted mirror of the power of God, and the image of his goodness.   

{7:27} And being but one, she can do all things: and remaining inherself, she maketh all things new: and in all ages entering into holysouls, she maketh them friends of God, and prophets.   

{7:28} For God loveth none but him that dwelleth with wisdom.   

{7:29} For she is more beautiful than the sun, and above all theorder of stars: being compared with the light, she is found before it.   

{7:30} For after this cometh night: but vice shall not prevailagainst wisdom.   

{8:1} Wisdom reacheth from one end to another mightily: and sweetlydoth she order all things.   

{8:2} I loved her, and sought her out from my youth, I desired tomake her my spouse, and I was a lover of her beauty.   

{8:3} In that she is conversant with God, she magnifieth hernobility: yea, the Lord of all things himself loved her.   

{8:4} For she is privy to the mysteries of the knowledge of God, anda lover of his works.   

{8:5} If riches be a possession to be desired in this life; what isricher than wisdom, that worketh all things?   

{8:6} And if prudence work; who of all that are is a more cunningworkman than she?   

{8:7} And if a man love righteousness her labours are virtues: forshe teacheth temperance and prudence, justice and fortitude: which aresuch things, as en can have nothing more profitable in their life.   

{8:8} If a man desire much experience, she knoweth things of old,and conjectureth aright what is to come: she knoweth the subtilties ofspeeches, and can expound dark sentences: she foreseeth signs andwonders, and the events of seasons and times.   

{8:9} Therefore I purposed to take her to me to live with me,knowing that she would be a counsellor of good things, and a comfort incares and grief.   

{8:10} For her sake I shall have estimation among the multitude, andhonour with the elders, though I be young.   

{8:11} I shall be found of a quick conceit in judgment, and shall beadmired in the sight of great men.   

{8:12} When I hold my tongue, they shall bide my leisure, and when Ispeak, they shall give good ear unto me: if I talk much, they shall laytheir hands upon their mouth.   

{8:13} Moreover by the means of her I shall obtain immortality, andleave behind me an everlasting memorial to them that come after me.   

{8:14} I shall set the people in order, and the nations shall besubject unto me.   

{8:15} Horrible tyrants shall be afraid, when they do but hear ofme; I shall be found good among the multitude, and valiant in war.   

{8:16} After I am come into mine house, I will repose myself withher: for her conversation hath no bitterness; and to live with her hathno sorrow, but mirth and joy.   

{8:17} Now when I considered these things in myself, and ponderedthem in my heart, how that to be allied unto wisdom is immortality;   

{8:18} And great pleasure it is to have her friendship; and in theworks of her hands are infinite riches; and in the exercise ofconference with her, prudence; and in talking with her, a good report;I went about seeking how to take her to me.   

{8:19} For I was a witty child, and had a good spirit.   

{8:20} Yea rather, being good, I came into a body undefiled.   

{8:21} Nevertheless, when I perceived that I could not otherwiseobtain her, except God gave her me; and that was a point of wisdom alsoto know whose gift she was; I prayed unto the Lord, and besought him,and with my whole heart I said,   

{9:1} O God of my fathers, and Lord of mercy, who hast made allthings with thy word,   

{9:2} And ordained man through thy wisdom, that he should havedominion over the creatures which thou hast made,   

{9:3} And order the world according to equity and righteousness, andexecute judgment with an upright heart:   

{9:4} Give me wisdom, that sitteth by thy throne; and reject me notfrom among thy children:   

{9:5} For I thy servant and son of thine handmaid am a feebleperson, and of a short time, and too young for the understanding ofjudgment and laws.   

{9:6} For though a man be never so perfect among the children ofmen, yet if thy wisdom be not with him, he shall be nothing regarded.   

{9:7} Thou hast chosen me to be a king of thy people, and a judge ofthy sons and daughters:   

{9:8} Thou hast commanded me to build a temple upon thy holy mount,and an altar in the city wherein thou dwellest, a resemblance of theholy tabernacle, which thou hast prepared from the beginning.   

{9:9} And wisdom was with thee: which knoweth thy works, and waspresent when thou madest the world, and knew what was acceptable in thysight, and right in thy commandments.   

{9:10} O send her out of thy holy heavens, and from the throne ofthy glory, that being present she may labour with me, that I may knowwhat is pleasing unto thee.   

{9:11} For she knoweth and understandeth all things, and she shalllead me soberly in my doings, and preserve me in her power.   

{9:12} So shall my works be acceptable, and then shall I judge thypeople righteously, and be worthy to sit in my father's seat.   

{9:13} For what man is he that can know the counsel of God? or whocan think what the will of the Lord is?   

{9:14} For the thoughts of mortal men are miserable, and our devicesare but uncertain.   

{9:15} For the corruptible body presseth down the soul, and theearthy tabernacle weigheth down the mind that museth upon many things.   

{9:16} And hardly do we guess aright at things that are upon earth,and with labour do we find the things that are before us: but thethings that are in heaven who hath searched out?   

{9:17} And thy counsel who hath known, except thou give wisdom, andsend thy Holy Spirit from above?   

{9:18} For so the ways of them which lived on the earth werereformed, and men were taught the things that are pleasing unto thee,and were saved through wisdom.   

{10:1} She preserved the first formed father of the world, that wascreated alone, and brought him out of his fall,   

{10:2} And gave him power to rule all things.   

{10:3} But when the unrighteous went away from her in his anger, heperished also in the fury wherewith he murdered his brother.   

{10:4} For whose cause the earth being drowned with the flood,wisdom again preserved it, and directed the course of the righteous ina piece of wood of small value.   

{10:5} Moreover, the nations in their wicked conspiracy beingconfounded, she found out the righteous, and preserved him blamelessunto God, and kept him strong against his tender compassion toward hisson.   

{10:6} When the ungodly perished, she delivered the righteous man,who fled from the fire which fell down upon the five cities.   

{10:7} Of whose wickedness even to this day the waste land thatsmoketh is a testimony, and plants bearing fruit that never come toripeness: and a standing pillar of salt is a monument of an unbelievingsoul.   

{10:8} For regarding not wisdom, they gat not only this hurt, thatthey knew not the things which were good; but also left behind them tothe world a memorial of their foolishness: so that in the thingswherein they offended they could not so much as be hid.   

{10:9} But wisdom delivered from pain those that attended upon her.   

{10:10} When the righteous fled from his brother's wrath she guidedhim in right paths, shewed him the kingdom of God, and gave himknowledge of holy things, made him rich in his travels, and multipliedthe fruit of his labours.   

{10:11} In the covetousness of such as oppressed him she stood byhim, and made him rich.   

{10:12} She defended him from his enemies, and kept him safe fromthose that lay in wait, and in a sore conflict she gave him thevictory; that he might know that goodness is stronger than all.   

{10:13} When the righteous was sold, she forsook him not, butdelivered him from sin: she went down with him into the pit,   

{10:14} And left him not in bonds, till she brought him the sceptreof the kingdom, and power against those that oppressed him: as for themthat had accused him, she shewed them to be liars, and gave himperpetual glory.   

{10:15} She delivered the righteous people and blameless seed fromthe nation that oppressed them.   

{10:16} She entered into the soul of the servant of the Lord, andwithstood dreadful kings in wonders and signs;   

{10:17} Rendered to the righteous a reward of their labours, guidedthem in a marvellous way, and was unto them for a cover by day, and alight of stars in the night season;   

{10:18} Brought them through the Red sea, and led them through muchwater:   

{10:19} But she drowned their enemies, and cast them up out of thebottom of the deep.   

{10:20} Therefore the righteous spoiled the ungodly, and praised thyholy name, O Lord, and magnified with one accord thine hand, thatfought for them.   

{10:21} For wisdom opened the mouth of the dumb, and made thetongues of them that cannot speak eloquent.   

{11:1} She prospered their works in the hand of the holy prophet.   

{11:2} They went through the wilderness that was not inhabited, andpitched tents in places where there lay no way.   

{11:3} They stood against their enemies, and were avenged of theiradversaries.   

{11:4} When they were thirsty, they called upon thee, and water wasgiven them out of the flinty rock, and their thirst was quenched out ofthe hard stone.   

{11:5} For by what things their enemies were punished, by the samethey in their need were benefited.   

{11:6} For instead of a perpetual running river troubled with foulblood,   

{11:7} For a manifest reproof of that commandment, whereby theinfants were slain, thou gavest unto them abundance of water by a meanswhich they hoped not for:   

{11:8} Declaring by that thirst then how thou hadst punished theiradversaries.   

{11:9} For when they were tried albeit but in mercy chastised, theyknew how the ungodly were judged in wrath and tormented, thirsting inanother manner than the just.   

{11:10} For these thou didst admonish and try, as a father: but theother, as a severe king, thou didst condemn and punish.   

{11:11} Whether they were absent or present, they were vexed alike.   

{11:12} For a double grief came upon them, and a groaning for theremembrance of things past.   

{11:13} For when they heard by their own punishments the other to bebenefited, they had some feeling of the Lord.   

{11:14} For whom they respected with scorn, when he was long beforethrown out at the casting forth of the infants, him in the end, whenthey saw what came to pass, they admired.   

{11:15} But for the foolish devices of their wickedness, wherewithbeing deceived they worshipped serpents void of reason, and vilebeasts, thou didst send a multitude of unreasonable beasts upon themfor vengeance;   

{11:16} That they might know, that wherewithal a man sinneth, by thesame also shall he be punished.   

{11:17} For thy Almighty hand, that made the world of matter withoutform, wanted not means to send among them a multitude of bears orfierce lions,   

{11:18} Or unknown wild beasts, full of rage, newly created,breathing out either a fiery vapour, or filthy scents of scatteredsmoke, or shooting horrible sparkles out of their eyes:   

{11:19} Whereof not only the harm might dispatch them at once, butalso the terrible sight utterly destroy them.   

{11:20} Yea, and without these might they have fallen down with oneblast, being persecuted of vengeance, and scattered abroad through thebreath of thy power: but thou hast ordered all things in measure andnumber and weight.   

{11:21} For thou canst shew thy great strength at all times whenthou wilt; and who may withstand the power of thine arm?   

{11:22} For the whole world before thee is as a little grain of thebalance, yea, as a drop of the morning dew that falleth down upon theearth.   

{11:23} But thou hast mercy upon all; for thou canst do all things,and winkest at the sins of men, because they should amend.   

{11:24} For thou lovest all the things that are, and abhorrestnothing which thou hast made: for never wouldest thou have made anything, if thou hadst hated it.   

{11:25} And how could any thing have endured, if it had not been thywill? or been preserved, if not called by thee?   

{11:26} But thou sparest all: for they are thine, O Lord, thou loverof souls.   

{12:1} For thine incorruptible Spirit is in all things.   

{12:2} Therefore chastenest thou them by little and little thatoffend, and warnest them by putting them in remembrance wherein theyhave offended, that leaving their wickedness they may believe on thee,O Lord.   

{12:3} For it was thy will to destroy by the hands of our fathersboth those old inhabitants of thy holy land,   

{12:4} Whom thou hatedst for doing most odious works of witchcrafts,and wicked sacrifices;   

{12:5} And also those merciless murderers of children, and devourersof man's flesh, and the feasts of blood,   

{12:6} With their priests out of the midst of their idolatrous crew,and the parents, that killed with their own hands souls destitute ofhelp:   

{12:7} That the land, which thou esteemedst above all other, mightreceive a worthy colony of God's children.   

{12:8} Nevertheless even those thou sparedst as men, and didst sendwasps, forerunners of thine host, to destroy them by little and little.   

{12:9} Not that thou wast unable to bring the ungodly under the handof the righteous in battle, or to destroy them at once with cruelbeasts, or with one rough word:   

{12:10} But executing thy judgments upon them by little and little,thou gavest them place of repentance, not being ignorant that they werea naughty generation, and that their malice was bred in them, and thattheir cogitation would never be changed.   

{12:11} For it was a cursed seed from the beginning; neither didstthou for fear of any man give them pardon for those things wherein theysinned.   

{12:12} For who shall say, What hast thou done? or who shallwithstand thy judgment? or who shall accuse thee for the nations thatperish, whom thou made? or who shall come to stand against thee, to berevenged for the unrighteous men?   

{12:13} For neither is there any God but thou that careth for all,to whom thou mightest shew that thy judgment is not unright.   

{12:14} Neither shall king or tyrant be able to set his face againstthee for any whom thou hast punished.   

{12:15} Forsomuch then as thou art righteous thyself, thou orderestall things righteously: thinking it not agreeable with thy power tocondemn him that hath not deserved to be punished.   

{12:16} For thy power is the beginning of righteousness, and becausethou art the Lord of all, it maketh thee to be gracious unto all.   

{12:17} For when men will not believe that thou art of a full power,thou shewest thy strength, and among them that know it thou makesttheir boldness manifest.   

{12:18} But thou, mastering thy power, judgest with equity, andorderest us with great favour: for thou mayest use power when thou wilt.   

{12:19} But by such works hast thou taught thy people that the justman should be merciful, and hast made thy children to be of a good hopethat thou givest repentance for sins.   

{12:20} For if thou didst punish the enemies of thy children, andthe condemned to death, with such deliberation, giving them time andplace, whereby they might be delivered from their malice:   

{12:21} With how great circumspection didst thou judge thine ownsons, unto whose fathers thou hast sworn, and made covenants of goodpromises?   

{12:22} Therefore, whereas thou dost chasten us, thou scourgest ourenemies a thousand times more, to the intent that, when we judge, weshould carefully think of thy goodness, and when we ourselves arejudged, we should look for mercy.   

{12:23} Wherefore, whereas men have lived dissolutely andunrighteously, thou hast tormented them with their own abominations.   

{12:24} For they went astray very far in the ways of error, and heldthem for gods, which even among the beasts of their enemies weredespised, being deceived, as children of no understanding.   

{12:25} Therefore unto them, as to children without the use ofreason, thou didst send a judgment to mock them.   

{12:26} But they that would not be reformed by that correction,wherein he dallied with them, shall feel a judgment worthy of God.   

{12:27} For, look, for what things they grudged, when they werepunished, that is, for them whom they thought to be gods; [now] beingpunished in them, when they saw it, they acknowledged him to be thetrue God, whom before they denied to know: and therefore came extremedamnation upon them.   

{13:1} Surely vain are all men by nature, who are ignorant of God,and could not out of the good things that are seen know him that is:neither by considering the works did they acknowledge the workmaster;   

{13:2} But deemed either fire, or wind, or the swift air, or thecircle of the stars, or the violent water, or the lights of heaven, tobe the gods which govern the world.   

{13:3} With whose beauty if they being delighted took them to begods; let them know how much better the Lord of them is: for the firstauthor of beauty hath created them.   

{13:4} But if they were astonished at their power and virtue, letthem understand by them, how much mightier he is that made them.   

{13:5} For by the greatness and beauty of the creaturesproportionably the maker of them is seen.   

{13:6} But yet for this they are the less to be blamed: for theyperadventure err, seeking God, and desirous to find him.   

{13:7} For being conversant in his works they search him diligently,and believe their sight: because the things are beautiful that are seen.   

{13:8} Howbeit neither are they to be pardoned.   

{13:9} For if they were able to know so much, that they could aim atthe world; how did they not sooner find out the Lord thereof?   

{13:10} But miserable are they, and in dead things is their hope,who call them gods, which are the works of men's hands, gold andsilver, to shew art in, and resemblances of beasts, or a stone good fornothing, the work of an ancient hand.   

{13:11} Now a carpenter that felleth timber, after he hath sawn downa tree meet for the purpose, and taken off all the bark skilfully roundabout, and hath wrought it handsomely, and made a vessel thereof fitfor the service of man's life;   

{13:12} And after spending the refuse of his work to dress his meat,hath filled himself;   

{13:13} And taking the very refuse among those which served to nouse, being a crooked piece of wood, and full of knots, hath carved itdiligently, when he had nothing else to do, and formed it by the skillof his understanding, and fashioned it to the image of a man;   

{13:14} Or made it like some vile beast, laying it over withvermilion, and with paint colouring it red, and covering every spottherein;   

{13:15} And when he had made a convenient room for it, set it in awall, and made it fast with iron:   

{13:16} For he provided for it that it might not fall, knowing thatit was unable to help itself; for it is an image, and hath need of help:   

{13:17} Then maketh he prayer for his goods, for his wife andchildren, and is not ashamed to speak to that which hath no life.   

{13:18} For health he calleth upon that which is weak: for lifeprayeth to that which is dead; for aid humbly beseecheth that whichhath least means to help: and for a good journey he asketh of thatwhich cannot set a foot forward:   

{13:19} And for gaining and getting, and for good success of hishands, asketh ability to do of him, that is most unable to do any thing.   

{14:1} Again, one preparing himself to sail, and about to passthrough the raging waves, calleth upon a piece of wood more rotten thanthe vessel that carrieth him.   

{14:2} For verily desire of gain devised that, and the workman builtit by his skill.   

{14:3} But thy providence, O Father, governeth it: for thou hastmade a way in the sea, and a safe path in the waves;   

{14:4} Shewing that thou canst save from all danger: yea, though aman went to sea without art.   

{14:5} Nevertheless thou wouldest not that the works of thy wisdomshould be idle, and therefore do men commit their lives to a smallpiece of wood, and passing the rough sea in a weak vessel are saved.   

{14:6} For in the old time also, when the proud giants perished, thehope of the world governed by thy hand escaped in a weak vessel, andleft to all ages a seed of generation.   

{14:7} For blessed is the wood whereby righteousness cometh.   

{14:8} But that which is made with hands is cursed, as well it, ashe that made it: he, because he made it; and it, because, beingcorruptible, it was called god.   

{14:9} For the ungodly and his ungodliness are both alike hatefulunto God.   

{14:10} For that which is made shall be punished together with himthat made it.   

{14:11} Therefore even upon the idols of the Gentiles shall there bea visitation: because in the creature of God they are become anabomination, and stumblingblocks to the souls of men, and a snare tothe feet of the unwise.   

{14:12} For the devising of idols was the beginning of spiritualfornication, and the invention of them the corruption of life.   

{14:13} For neither were they from the beginning, neither shall theybe for ever.   

{14:14} For by the vain glory of men they entered into the world,and therefore shall they come shortly to an end.   

{14:15} For a father afflicted with untimely mourning, when he hathmade an image of his child soon taken away, now honoured him as a god,which was then a dead man, and delivered to those that were under himceremonies and sacrifices.   

{14:16} Thus in process of time an ungodly custom grown strong waskept as a law, and graven images were worshipped by the commandments ofkings.   

{14:17} Whom men could not honour in presence, because they dweltfar off, they took the counterfeit of his visage from far, and made anexpress image of a king whom they honoured, to the end that by thistheir forwardness they might flatter him that was absent, as if he werepresent.   

{14:18} Also the singular diligence of the artificer did help to setforward the ignorant to more superstition.   

{14:19} For he, peradventure willing to please one in authority,forced all his skill to make the resemblance of the best fashion.   

{14:20} And so the multitude, allured by the grace of the work, tookhim now for a god, which a little before was but honoured.   

{14:21} And this was an occasion to deceive the world: for men,serving either calamity or tyranny, did ascribe unto stones and stocksthe incommunicable name.   

{14:22} Moreover this was not enough for them, that they erred inthe knowledge of God; but whereas they lived in the great war ofignorance, those so great plagues called they peace.   

{14:23} For whilst they slew their children in sacrifices, or usedsecret ceremonies, or made revellings of strange rites;   

{14:24} They kept neither lives nor marriages any longer undefiled:but either one slew another traiterously, or grieved him by adultery.   

{14:25} So that there reigned in all men without exception blood,manslaughter, theft, and dissimulation, corruption, unfaithfulness,tumults, perjury,   

{14:26} Disquieting of good men, forgetfulness of good turns,defiling of souls, changing of kind, disorder in marriages, adultery,and shameless uncleanness.   

{14:27} For the worshipping of idols not to be named is thebeginning, the cause, and the end, of all evil.   

{14:28} For either they are mad when they be merry, or prophesylies, or live unjustly, or else lightly forswear themselves.   

{14:29} For insomuch as their trust is in idols, which have no life;though they swear falsely, yet they look not to be hurt.   

{14:30} Howbeit for both causes shall they be justly punished: bothbecause they thought not well of God, giving heed unto idols, and alsounjustly swore in deceit, despising holiness.   

{14:31} For it is not the power of them by whom they swear: but itis the just vengeance of sinners, that punisheth always the offence ofthe ungodly.   

{15:1} But thou, O God, art gracious and true, longsuffering, and inmercy ordering all things,   

{15:2} For if we sin, we are thine, knowing thy power: but we willnot sin, knowing that we are counted thine.   

{15:3} For to know thee is perfect righteousness: yea, to know thypower is the root of immortality.   

{15:4} For neither did the mischievous invention of men deceive us,nor an image spotted with divers colours, the painter's fruitlesslabour;   

{15:5} The sight whereof enticeth fools to lust after it, and sothey desire the form of a dead image, that hath no breath.   

{15:6} Both they that make them, they that desire them, and theythat worship them, are lovers of evil things, and are worthy to havesuch things to trust upon.   

{15:7} For the potter, tempering soft earth, fashioneth every vesselwith much labour for our service: yea, of the same clay he maketh boththe vessels that serve for clean uses, and likewise also all such asserve to the contrary: but what is the use of either sort, the potterhimself is the judge.   

{15:8} And employing his labours lewdly, he maketh a vain god of thesame clay, even he which a little before was made of earth himself, andwithin a little while after returneth to the same, out when his lifewhich was lent him shall be demanded.   

{15:9} Notwithstanding his care is, not that he shall have muchlabour, nor that his life is short: but striveth to excel goldsmithsand silversmiths, and endeavoureth to do like the workers in brass, andcounteth it his glory to make counterfeit things.   

{15:10} His heart is ashes, his hope is more vile than earth, andhis life of less value than clay:   

{15:11} Forasmuch as he knew not his Maker, and him that inspiredinto him an active soul, and breathed in a living spirit.   

{15:12} But they counted our life a pastime, and our time here amarket for gain: for, say they, we must be getting every way, though itbe by evil means.   

{15:13} For this man, that of earthly matter maketh brittle vesselsand graven images, knoweth himself to offend above all others.   

{15:14} And all the enemies of thy people, that hold them insubjection, are most foolish, and are more miserable than very babes.   

{15:15} For they counted all the idols of the heathen to be gods:which neither have the use of eyes to see, nor noses to draw breath,nor ears to hear, nor fingers of hands to handle; and as for theirfeet, they are slow to go.   

{15:16} For man made them, and he that borrowed his own spiritfashioned them: but no man can make a god like unto himself.   

{15:17} For being mortal, he worketh a dead thing with wicked hands:for he himself is better than the things which he worshippeth: whereashe lived once, but they never.   

{15:18} Yea, they worshipped those beasts also that are mosthateful: for being compared together, some are worse than others.   

{15:19} Neither are they beautiful, so much as to be desired inrespect of beasts: but they went without the praise of God and hisblessing.   

{16:1} Therefore by the like were they punished worthily, and by themultitude of beasts tormented.   

{16:2} Instead of which punishment, dealing graciously with thineown people, thou preparedst for them meat of a strange taste, evenquails to stir up their appetite:   

{16:3} To the end that they, desiring food, might for the ugly sightof the beasts sent among them lothe even that, which they must needsdesire; but these, suffering penury for a short space, might be madepartakers of a strange taste.   

{16:4} For it was requisite, that upon them exercising tyrannyshould come penury, which they could not avoid: but to these it shouldonly be shewed how their enemies were tormented.   

{16:5} For when the horrible fierceness of beasts came upon these,and they perished with the stings of crooked serpents, thy wrathendured not for ever:   

{16:6} But they were troubled for a small season, that they might beadmonished, having a sign of salvation, to put them in remembrance ofthe commandment of thy law.   

{16:7} For he that turned himself toward it was not saved by thething that he saw, but by thee, that art the Saviour of all.   

{16:8} And in this thou madest thine enemies confess, that it isthou who deliverest from all evil:   

{16:9} For them the bitings of grasshoppers and flies killed,neither was there found any remedy for their life: for they were worthyto be punished by such.   

{16:10} But thy sons not the very teeth of venomous dragonsovercame: for thy mercy was ever by them, and healed them.   

{16:11} For they were pricked, that they should remember thy words;and were quickly saved, that not falling into deep forgetfulness, theymight be continually mindful of thy goodness.   

{16:12} For it was neither herb, nor mollifying plaister, thatrestored them to health: but thy word, O Lord, which healeth all things.   

{16:13} For thou hast power of life and death: thou leadest to thegates of hell, and bringest up again.   

{16:14} A man indeed killeth through his malice: and the spirit,when it is gone forth, returneth not; neither the soul received upcometh again.   

{16:15} But it is not possible to escape thine hand.   

{16:16} For the ungodly, that denied to know thee, were scourged bythe strength of thine arm: with strange rains, hails, and showers, werethey persecuted, that they could not avoid, and through fire were theyconsumed.   

{16:17} For, which is most to be wondered at, the fire had moreforce in the water, that quencheth all things: for the world fightethfor the righteous.   

{16:18} For sometime the flame was mitigated, that it might not burnup the beasts that were sent against the ungodly; but themselves mightsee and perceive that they were persecuted with the judgment of God.   

{16:19} And at another time it burneth even in the midst of waterabove the power of fire, that it might destroy the fruits of an unjustland.   

{16:20} Instead whereof thou feddest thine own people with angels'food, and didst send them from heaven bread prepared without theirlabour, able to content every man's delight, and agreeing to everytaste.   

{16:21} For thy sustenance declared thy sweetness unto thy children,and serving to the appetite of the eater, tempered itself to everyman's liking.   

{16:22} But snow and ice endured the fire, and melted not, that theymight know that fire burning in the hail, and sparkling in the rain,did destroy the fruits of the enemies.   

{16:23} But this again did even forget his own strength, that therighteous might be nourished.   

{16:24} For the creature that serveth thee, who art the Makerincreaseth his strength against the unrighteous for their punishment,and abateth his strength for the benefit of such as put their trust inthee.   

{16:25} Therefore even then was it altered into all fashions, andwas obedient to thy grace, that nourisheth all things, according to thedesire of them that had need:   

{16:26} That thy children, O Lord, whom thou lovest, might know,that it is not the growing of fruits that nourisheth man: but that itis thy word, which preserveth them that put their trust in thee.   

{16:27} For that which was not destroyed of the fire, being warmedwith a little sunbeam, soon melted away:   

{16:28} That it might be known, that we must prevent the sun to givethee thanks, and at the dayspring pray unto thee.   

{16:29} For the hope of the unthankful shall melt away as thewinter's hoar frost, and shall run away as unprofitable water.   

{17:1} For great are thy judgments, and cannot be expressed:therefore unnurtured souls have erred.   

{17:2} For when unrighteous men thought to oppress the holy nation;they being shut up in their houses, the prisoners of darkness, andfettered with the bonds of a long night, lay [there] exiled from theeternal providence.   

{17:3} For while they supposed to lie hid in their secret sins, theywere scattered under a dark veil of forgetfulness, being horriblyastonished, and troubled with [strange] apparitions.   

{17:4} For neither might the corner that held them keep them fromfear: but noises [as of waters] falling down sounded about them, andsad visions appeared unto them with heavy countenances.   

{17:5} No power of the fire might give them light: neither could thebright flames of the stars endure to lighten that horrible night.   

{17:6} Only there appeared unto them a fire kindled of itself, verydreadful: for being much terrified, they thought the things which theysaw to be worse than the sight they saw not.   

{17:7} As for the illusions of art magick, they were put down, andtheir vaunting in wisdom was reproved with disgrace.   

{17:8} For they, that promised to drive away terrors and troublesfrom a sick soul, were sick themselves of fear, worthy to be laughed at.   

{17:9} For though no terrible thing did fear them; yet being scaredwith beasts that passed by, and hissing of serpents,   

{17:10} They died for fear, denying that they saw the air, whichcould of no side be avoided.   

{17:11} For wickedness, condemned by her own witness, is verytimorous, and being pressed with conscience, always forecastethgrievous things.   

{17:12} For fear is nothing else but a betraying of the succourswhich reason offereth.   

{17:13} And the expectation from within, being less, counteth theignorance more than the cause which bringeth the torment.   

{17:14} But they sleeping the same sleep that night, which wasindeed intolerable, and which came upon them out of the bottoms ofinevitable hell,   

{17:15} Were partly vexed with monstrous apparitions, and partlyfainted, their heart failing them: for a sudden fear, and not lookedfor, came upon them.   

{17:16} So then whosoever there fell down was straitly kept, shut upin a prison without iron bars,   

{17:17} For whether he were husbandman, or shepherd, or a labourerin the field, he was overtaken, and endured that necessity, which couldnot be avoided: for they were all bound with one chain of darkness.   

{17:18} Whether it were a whistling wind, or a melodious noise ofbirds among the spreading branches, or a pleasing fall of water runningviolently,   

{17:19} Or a terrible sound of stones cast down, or a running thatcould not be seen of skipping beasts, or a roaring voice of most savagewild beasts, or a rebounding echo from the hollow mountains; thesethings made them to swoon for fear.   

{17:20} For the whole world shined with clear light, and none werehindered in their labour:   

{17:21} Over them only was spread an heavy night, an image of thatdarkness which should afterward receive them: but yet were they untothemselves more grievous than the darkness.   

{18:1} Nevertheless thy saints had a very great light, whose voicethey hearing, and not seeing their shape, because they also had notsuffered the same things, they counted them happy.   

{18:2} But for that they did not hurt them now, of whom they hadbeen wronged before, they thanked them, and besought them pardon forthat they had been enemies.   

{18:3} Instead whereof thou gavest them a burning pillar of fire,both to be a guide of the unknown journey, and an harmless sun toentertain them honourably.   

{18:4} For they were worthy to be deprived of light and imprisonedin darkness, who had kept thy sons shut up, by whom the uncorrupt lightof the law was to be given unto the world.   

{18:5} And when they had determined to slay the babes of the saints,one child being cast forth, and saved, to reprove them, thou tookestaway the multitude of their children, and destroyedst them altogetherin a mighty water.   

{18:6} Of that night were our fathers certified afore, thatassuredly knowing unto what oaths they had given credence, they mightafterwards be of good cheer.   

{18:7} So of thy people was accepted both the salvation of therighteous, and destruction of the enemies.   

{18:8} For wherewith thou didst punish our adversaries, by the samethou didst glorify us, whom thou hadst called.   

{18:9} For the righteous children of good men did sacrificesecretly, and with one consent made a holy law, that the saints shouldbe like partakers of the same good and evil, the fathers now singingout the songs of praise.   

{18:10} But on the other side there sounded an ill according cry ofthe enemies, and a lamentable noise was carried abroad for childrenthat were bewailed.   

{18:11} The master and the servant were punished after one manner;and like as the king, so suffered the common person.   

{18:12} So they all together had innumerable dead with one kind ofdeath; neither were the living sufficient to bury them: for in onemoment the noblest offspring of them was destroyed.   

{18:13} For whereas they would not believe any thing by reason ofthe enchantments; upon the destruction of the firstborn, theyacknowledged this people to be the sons of God.   

{18:14} For while all things were in quiet silence, and that nightwas in the midst of her swift course,   

{18:15} Thine Almighty word leaped down from heaven out of thy royalthrone, as a fierce man of war into the midst of a land of destruction,   

{18:16} And brought thine unfeigned commandment as a sharp sword,and standing up filled all things with death; and it touched theheaven, but it stood upon the earth.   

{18:17} Then suddenly visions of horrible dreams troubled them sore,and terrors came upon them unlooked for.   

{18:18} And one thrown here, and another there, half dead, shewedthe cause of his death.   

{18:19} For the dreams that troubled them did foreshew this, lestthey should perish, and not know why they were afflicted.   

{18:20} Yea, the tasting of death touched the righteous also, andthere was a destruction of the multitude in the wilderness: but thewrath endured not long.   

{18:21} For then the blameless man made haste, and stood forth todefend them; and bringing the shield of his proper ministry, evenprayer, and the propitiation of incense, set himself against the wrath,and so brought the calamity to an end, declaring that he was thyservant.   

{18:22} So he overcame the destroyer, not with strength of body, norforce of arms, but with a word subdued him that punished, alleging theoaths and covenants made with the fathers.   

{18:23} For when the dead were now fallen down by heaps one uponanother, standing between, he stayed the wrath, and parted the way tothe living.   

{18:24} For in the long garment was the whole world, and in the fourrows of the stones was the glory of the fathers graven, and thy Majestyupon the daidem of his head.   

{18:25} Unto these the destroyer gave place, and was afraid of them:for it was enough that they only tasted of the wrath.   

{19:1} As for the ungodly, wrath came upon them without mercy untothe end: for he knew before what they would do;   

{19:2} How that having given them leave to depart, and sent themhastily away, they would repent and pursue them.   

{19:3} For whilst they were yet mourning and making lamentation atthe graves of the dead, they added another foolish device, and pursuedthem as fugitives, whom they had intreated to be gone.   

{19:4} For the destiny, whereof they were worthy, drew them untothis end, and made them forget the things that had already happened,that they might fulfil the punishment which was wanting to theirtorments:   

{19:5} And that thy people might pass a wonderful way: but theymight find a strange death.   

{19:6} For the whole creature in his proper kind was fashioned againanew, serving the peculiar commandments that were given unto them, thatthy children might be kept without hurt:   

{19:7} As namely, a cloud shadowing the camp; and where water stoodbefore, dry land appeared; and out of the Red sea a way withoutimpediment; and out of the violent stream a green field:   

{19:8} Wherethrough all the people went that were defended with thyhand, seeing thy marvellous strange wonders.   

{19:9} For they went at large like horses, and leaped like lambs,praising thee, O Lord, who hadst delivered them.   

{19:10} For they were yet mindful of the things that were done whilethey sojourned in the strange land, how the ground brought forth fliesinstead of cattle, and how the river cast up a multitude of frogsinstead of fishes.   

{19:11} But afterwards they saw a new generation of fowls, when,being led with their appetite, they asked delicate meats.   

{19:12} For quails came up unto them from the sea for theircontentment.   

{19:13} And punishments came upon the sinners not without formersigns by the force of thunders: for they suffered justly according totheir own wickedness, insomuch as they used a more hard and hatefulbehaviour toward strangers.   

{19:14} For the Sodomites did not receive those, whom they knew notwhen they came: but these brought friends into bondage, that had welldeserved of them.   

{19:15} And not only so, but peradventure some respect shall be hadof those, because they used strangers not friendly:   

{19:16} But these very grievously afflicted them, whom they hadreceived with feastings, and were already made partakers of the samelaws with them.   

{19:17} Therefore even with blindness were these stricken, as thosewere at the doors of the righteous man: when, being compassed aboutwith horrible great darkness, every one sought the passage of his owndoors.   

{19:18} For the elements were changed in themselves by a kind ofharmony, like as in a psaltery notes change the name of the tune, andyet are always sounds; which may well be perceived by the sight of thethings that have been done.   

{19:19} For earthly things were turned into watery, and the things,that before swam in the water, now went upon the ground.   

{19:20} The fire had power in the water, forgetting his own virtue:and the water forgat his own quenching nature.   

{19:21} On the other side, the flames wasted not the flesh of thecorruptible living things, though they walked therein; neither meltedthey the icy kind of heavenly meat that was of nature apt to melt.   

{19:22} For in all things, O Lord, thou didst magnify thy people,and glorify them, neither didst thou lightly regard them: but didstassist them in every time and place.The Wisdom of Jesus the Son of Sirach,or Ecclesiasticus   A Prologue made by an uncertain Author   This Jesus was the son of Sirach, and grandchild to Jesus of thesame name with him: this man therefore lived in the latter times, afterthe people had been led away captive, and called home a again, andalmost after all the prophets. Now his grandfather Jesus, as he himselfwitnesseth, was a man of great diligence and wisdom among the Hebrews,who did not only gather the grave and short sentences of wise men, thathad been before him, but himself also uttered some of his own, full ofmuch understanding and wisdom. When as therefore the first Jesus died,leaving this book almost perfected, Sirach his son receiving it afterhim left it to his own son Jesus, who, having gotten it into his hands,compiled it all orderly into one volume, and called it Wisdom,intituling it both by his own name, his father's name, and hisgrandfather's; alluring the hearer by the very name of Wisdom to have agreater love to the study of this book. It containeth therefore wisesayings, dark sentences, and parables, and certain particular ancientgodly stories of men that pleased God; also his prayer and song;moreover, what benefits God had vouchsafed his people, and what plagueshe had heaped upon their enemies. This Jesus did imitate Solomon, andwas no less famous for wisdom and learning, both being indeed a man ofgreat learning, and so reputed also.   The Prologue of the Wisdom of Jesus the Son of Sirach.   Whereas many and great things have been delivered unto us by the lawand the prophets, and by others that have followed their steps, for thewhich things Israel ought to be commended for learning and wisdom; andwhereof not only the readers must needs become skilful themselves, butalso they that desire to learn be able to profit them which arewithout, both by speaking and writing: my grandfather Jesus, when hehad much given himself to the reading of the law, and the prophets, andother books of our fathers, and had gotten therein good judgment, wasdrawn on also himself to write something pertaining to learning andwisdom; to the intent that those which are desirous to learn, and areaddicted to these things, might profit much more in living according tothe law. Wherefore let me intreat you to read it with favour andattention, and to pardon us, wherein we may seem to come short of somewords, which we have laboured to interpret. For the same things utteredin Hebrew, and translated into another tongue, have not the same forcein them: and not only these things, but the law itself, and theprophets, and the rest of the books, have no small difference, whenthey are spoken in their own language. For in the eight and thirtiethyear coming into Egypt, when Euergetes was king, and continuing theresome time, I found a book of no small learning: therefore I thought itmost necessary for me to bestow some diligence and travail to interpretit; using great watchfulness and skill in that space to bring the bookto an end, and set it forth for them also, which in a strange countryare willing to learn, being prepared before in manners to live afterthe law.   

{1:1} All wisdom cometh from the Lord, and is with him for ever.   

{1:2} Who can number the sand of the sea, and the drops of rain, andthe days of eternity?   

{1:3} Who can find out the height of heaven, and the breadth of theearth, and the deep, and wisdom?   

{1:4} Wisdom hath been created before all things, and theunderstanding of prudence from everlasting.   

{1:5} The word of God most high is the fountain of wisdom; and herways are everlasting commandments.   

{1:6} To whom hath the root of wisdom been revealed? or who hathknown her wise counsels?   

{1:7} [Unto whom hath the knowledge of wisdom been made manifest?and who hath understood her great experience?]   

{1:8} There is one wise and greatly to be feared, the Lord sittingupon his throne.   

{1:9} He created her, and saw her, and numbered her, and poured herout upon all his works.   

{1:10} She is with all flesh according to his gift, and he hathgiven her to them that love him.   

{1:11} The fear of the Lord is honour, and glory, and gladness, anda crown of rejoicing.   

{1:12} The fear of the Lord maketh a merry heart, and giveth joy,and gladness, and a long life.   

{1:13} Whoso feareth the Lord, it shall go well with him at thelast, and he shall find favour in the day of his death.   

{1:14} To fear the Lord is the beginning of wisdom: and it wascreated with the faithful in the womb.   

{1:15} She hath built an everlasting foundation with men, and sheshall continue with their seed.   

{1:16} To fear the Lord is fulness of wisdom, and filleth men withher fruits.   

{1:17} She filleth all their house with things desirable, and thegarners with her increase.   

{1:18} The fear of the Lord is a crown of wisdom, making peace andperfect health to flourish; both which are the gifts of God: and itenlargeth their rejoicing that love him.   

{1:19} Wisdom raineth down skill and knowledge of understandingstanding, and exalteth them to honour that hold her fast.   

{1:20} The root of wisdom is to fear the Lord, and the branchesthereof are long life.   

{1:21} The fear of the Lord driveth away sins: and where it ispresent, it turneth away wrath.   

{1:22} A furious man cannot be justified; for the sway of his furyshall be his destruction.   

{1:23} A patient man will tear for a time, and afterward joy shallspring up unto him.   

{1:24} He will hide his words for a time, and the lips of many shalldeclare his wisdom.   

{1:25} The parables of knowledge are in the treasures of wisdom: butgodliness is an abomination to a sinner.   

{1:26} If thou desire wisdom, keep the commandments, and the Lordshall give her unto thee.   

{1:27} For the fear of the Lord is wisdom and instruction: and faithand meekness are his delight.   

{1:28} Distrust not the fear of the Lord when thou art poor: andcome not unto him with a double heart.   

{1:29} Be not an hypocrite in the sight of men, and take good heedwhat thou speakest.   

{1:30} Exalt not thyself, lest thou fall, and bring dishonour uponthy soul, and so God discover thy secrets, and cast thee down in themidst of the congregation, because thou camest not in truth to the fearof the Lord, but thy heart is full of deceit.   

{2:1} My son, if thou come to serve the Lord, prepare thy soul fortemptation.   

{2:2} Set thy heart aright, and constantly endure, and make nothaste in time of trouble.   

{2:3} Cleave unto him, and depart not away, that thou mayest beincreased at thy last end.   

{2:4} Whatsoever is brought upon thee take cheerfully, and bepatient when thou art changed to a low estate.   

{2:5} For gold is tried in the fire, and acceptable men in thefurnace of adversity.   

{2:6} Believe in him, and he will help thee; order thy way aright,and trust in him.   

{2:7} Ye that fear the Lord, wait for his mercy; and go not aside,lest ye fall.   

{2:8} Ye that fear the Lord, believe him; and your reward shall notfail.   

{2:9} Ye that fear the Lord, hope for good, and for everlasting joyand mercy.   

{2:10} Look at the generations of old, and see; did ever any trustin the Lord, and was confounded? or did any abide in his fear, and wasforsaken? or whom did he ever despise, that called upon him?   

{2:11} For the Lord is full of compassion and mercy, longsuffering,and very pitiful, and forgiveth sins, and saveth in time of affliction.   

{2:12} Woe be to fearful hearts, and faint hands, and the sinnerthat goeth two ways!   

{2:13} Woe unto him that is fainthearted! for he believeth not;therefore shall he not be defended.   

{2:14} Woe unto you that have lost patience! and what will ye dowhen the Lord shall visit you?   

{2:15} They that fear the Lord will not disobey his Word; and theythat love him will keep his ways.   

{2:16} They that fear the Lord will seek that which is well,pleasing unto him; and they that love him shall be filled with the law.   

{2:17} They that fear the Lord will prepare their hearts, and humbletheir souls in his sight,   

{2:18} Saying, We will fall into the hands of the Lord, and not intothe hands of men: for as his majesty is, so is his mercy.   

{3:1} Hear me your father, O children, and do thereafter, that yemay be safe.   

{3:2} For the Lord hath given the father honour over the children,and hath confirmed the authority of the mother over the sons.   

{3:3} Whoso honoureth his father maketh an atonement for his sins:   

{3:4} And he that honoureth his mother is as one that layeth uptreasure.   

{3:5} Whoso honoureth his father shall have joy of his own children;and when he maketh his prayer, he shall be heard.   

{3:6} He that honoureth his father shall have a long life; and hethat is obedient unto the Lord shall be a comfort to his mother.   

{3:7} He that feareth the Lord will honour his father, and will doservice unto his parents, as to his masters.   

{3:8} Honour thy father and mother both in word and deed, that ablessing may come upon thee from them.   

{3:9} For the blessing of the father establisheth the houses ofchildren; but the curse of the mother rooteth out foundations.   

{3:10} Glory not in the dishonour of thy father; for thy father'sdishonour is no glory unto thee.   

{3:11} For the glory of a man is from the honour of his father; anda mother in dishonour is a reproach to the children.   

{3:12} My son, help thy father in his age, and grieve him not aslong as he liveth.   

{3:13} And if his understanding fail, have patience with him; anddespise him not when thou art in thy full strength.   

{3:14} For the relieving of thy father shall not be forgotten: andinstead of sins it shall be added to build thee up.   

{3:15} In the day of thine affliction it shall be remembered; thysins also shall melt away, as the ice in the fair warm weather.   

{3:16} He that forsaketh his father is as a blasphemer; and he thatangereth his mother is cursed: of God.   

{3:17} My son, go on with thy business in meekness; so shalt thou bebeloved of him that is approved.   

{3:18} The greater thou art, the more humble thyself, and thou shaltfind favour before the Lord.   

{3:19} Many are in high place, and of renown: but mysteries arerevealed unto the meek.   

{3:20} For the power of the Lord is great, and he is honoured of thelowly.   

{3:21} Seek not out things that are too hard for thee, neithersearch the things that are above thy strength.   

{3:22} But what is commanded thee, think thereupon with reverence,for it is not needful for thee to see with thine eyes the things thatare in secret.   

{3:23} Be not curious in unnecessary matters: for more things areshewed unto thee than men understand.   

{3:24} For many are deceived by their own vain opinion; and an evilsuspicion hath overthrown their judgment.   

{3:25} Without eyes thou shalt want light: profess not the knowledgetherefore that thou hast not.   

{3:26} A stubborn heart shall fare evil at the last; and he thatloveth danger shall perish therein.   

{3:27} An obstinate heart shall be laden with sorrows; and thewicked man shall heap sin upon sin.   

{3:28} In the punishment of the proud there is no remedy; for theplant of wickedness hath taken root in him.   

{3:29} The heart of the prudent will understand a parable; and anattentive ear is the desire of a wise man.   

{3:30} Water will quench a flaming fire; and alms maketh anatonement for sins.   

{3:31} And he that requiteth good turns is mindful of that which maycome hereafter; and when he falleth, he shall find a stay.   

{4:1} My son, defraud not the poor of his living, and make not theneedy eyes to wait long.   

{4:2} Make not an hungry soul sorrowful; neither provoke a man inhis distress.   

{4:3} Add not more trouble to an heart that is vexed; and defer notto give to him that is in need.   

{4:4} Reject not the supplication of the afflicted; neither turnaway thy face from a poor man.   

{4:5} Turn not away thine eye from the needy, and give him noneoccasion to curse thee:   

{4:6} For if he curse thee in the bitterness of his soul, his prayershall be heard of him that made him.   

{4:7} Get thyself the love of the congregation, and bow thy head toa great man.   

{4:8} Let it not grieve thee to bow down thine ear to the poor, andgive him a friendly answer with meekness.   

{4:9} Deliver him that suffereth wrong from the hand of theoppressor; and be not fainthearted when thou sittest in judgment.   

{4:10} Be as a father unto the fatherless, and instead of an husbandunto their mother: so shalt thou be as the son of the most High, and heshall love thee more than thy mother doth.   

{4:11} Wisdom exalteth her children, and layeth hold of them thatseek her.   

{4:12} He that loveth her loveth life; and they that seek to herearly shall be filled with joy.   

{4:13} He that holdeth her fast shall inherit glory; and wheresoevershe entereth, the Lord will bless.   

{4:14} They that serve her shall minister to the Holy One: and themthat love her the Lord doth love.   

{4:15} Whoso giveth ear unto her shall judge the nations: and hethat attendeth unto her shall dwell securely.   

{4:16} If a man commit himself unto her, he shall inherit her; andhis generation shall hold her in possession.   

{4:17} For at the first she will walk with him by crooked ways, andbring fear and dread upon him, and torment him with her discipline,until she may trust his soul, and try him by her laws.   

{4:18} Then will she return the straight way unto him, and comforthim, and shew him her secrets.   

{4:19} But if he go wrong, she will forsake him, and give him overto his own ruin.   

{4:20} Observe the opportunity, and beware of evil; and be notashamed when it concerneth thy soul.   

{4:21} For there is a shame that bringeth sin; and there is a shamewhich is glory and grace.   

{4:22} Accept no person against thy soul, and let not the reverenceof any man cause thee to fall.   

{4:23} And refrain not to speak, when there is occasion to do good,and hide not thy wisdom in her beauty.   

{4:24} For by speech wisdom shall be known: and learning by the wordof the tongue.   

{4:25} In no wise speak against the truth; but be abashed of theerror of thine ignorance.   

{4:26} Be not ashamed to confess thy sins; and force not the courseof the river.   

{4:27} Make not thyself an underling to a foolish man; neitheraccept the person of the mighty.   

{4:28} Strive for the truth unto death, and the Lord shall fight forthee.   

{4:29} Be not hasty in thy tongue, and in thy deeds slack and remiss.   

{4:30} Be not as a lion in thy house, nor frantick among thyservants.   

{4:31} Let not thine hand be stretched out to receive, and shut whenthou shouldest repay.   

{5:1} Set thy heart upon thy goods; and say not, I have enough formy life.   

{5:2} Follow not thine own mind and thy strength, to walk in theways of thy heart:   

{5:3} And say not, Who shall controul me for my works? for the Lordwill surely revenge thy pride.   

{5:4} Say not, I have sinned, and what harm hath happened unto me?for the Lord is longsuffering, he will in no wise let thee go.   

{5:5} Concerning propitiation, be not without fear to add sin untosin:   

{5:6} And say not His mercy is great; he will be pacified for themultitude of my sins: for mercy and wrath come from him, and hisindignation resteth upon sinners.   

{5:7} Make no tarrying to turn to the Lord, and put not off from dayto day: for suddenly shall the wrath of the Lord come forth, and in thysecurity thou shalt be destroyed, and perish in the day of vengeance.   

{5:8} Set not thine heart upon goods unjustly gotten, for they shallnot profit thee in the day of calamity.   

{5:9} Winnow not with every wind, and go not into every way: for sodoth the sinner that hath a double tongue.   

{5:10} Be stedfast in thy understanding; and let thy word be thesame.   

{5:11} Be swift to hear; and let thy life be sincere; and withpatience give answer.   

{5:12} If thou hast understanding, answer thy neighbour; if not, laythy hand upon thy mouth.   

{5:13} Honour and shame is in talk: and the tongue of man is hisfall.   

{5:14} Be not called a whisperer, and lie not in wait with thytongue: for a foul shame is upon the thief, and an evil condemnationupon the double tongue.   

{5:15} Be not ignorant of any thing in a great matter or a small.   

{6:1} Instead of a friend become not an enemy; for [thereby] thoushalt inherit an ill name, shame, and reproach: even so shall a sinnerthat hath a double tongue.   

{6:2} Extol not thyself in the counsel of thine own heart; that thysoul be not torn in pieces as a bull [straying alone.]   

{6:3} Thou shalt eat up thy leaves, and lose thy fruit, and leavethyself as a dry tree.   

{6:4} A wicked soul shall destroy him that hath it, and shall makehim to be laughed to scorn of his enemies.   

{6:5} Sweet language will multiply friends: and a fairspeakingtongue will increase kind greetings.   

{6:6} Be in peace with many: nevertheless have but one counsellor ofa thousand.   

{6:7} If thou wouldest get a friend, prove him first and be nothasty to credit him.   

{6:8} For some man is a friend for his own occasion, and will notabide in the day of thy trouble.   

{6:9} And there is a friend, who being turned to enmity, and strifewill discover thy reproach.   

{6:10} Again, some friend is a companion at the table, and will notcontinue in the day of thy affliction.   

{6:11} But in thy prosperity he will be as thyself, and will be boldover thy servants.   

{6:12} If thou be brought low, he will be against thee, and willhide himself from thy face.   

{6:13} Separate thyself from thine enemies, and take heed of thyfriends.   

{6:14} A faithfull friend is a strong defence: and he that hathfound such an one hath found a treasure.   

{6:15} Nothing doth countervail a faithful friend, and hisexcellency is invaluable.   

{6:16} A faithful friend is the medicine of life; and they that fearthe Lord shall find him.   

{6:17} Whoso feareth the Lord shall direct his friendship aright:for as he is, so shall his neighbour be also.   

{6:18} My son, gather instruction from thy youth up: so shalt thoufind wisdom till thine old age.   

{6:19} Come unto her as one that ploweth and soweth, and wait forher good fruits: for thou shalt not toil much in labouring about her,but thou shalt eat of her fruits right soon.   

{6:20} She is very unpleasant to the unlearned: he that is withoutunderstanding will not remain with her.   

{6:21} She will lie upon him as a mighty stone of trial; and he willcast her from him ere it be long.   

{6:22} For wisdom is according to her name, and she is not manifestunto many.   

{6:23} Give ear, my son, receive my advice, and refuse not mycounsel,   

{6:24} And put thy feet into her fetters, and thy neck into herchain.   

{6:25} Bow down thy shoulder, and bear her, and be not grieved withher bonds.   

{6:26} Come unto her with thy whole heart, and keep her ways withall thy power.   

{6:27} Search, and seek, and she shall be made known unto thee: andwhen thou hast got hold of her, let her not go.   

{6:28} For at the last thou shalt find her rest, and that shall beturned to thy joy.   

{6:29} Then shall her fetters be a strong defence for thee, and herchains a robe of glory.   

{6:30} For there is a golden ornament upon her, and her bands arepurple lace.   

{6:31} Thou shalt put her on as a robe of honour, and shalt put herabout thee as a crown of joy.   

{6:32} My son, if thou wilt, thou shalt be taught: and if thou wiltapply thy mind, thou shalt be prudent.   

{6:33} If thou love to hear, thou shalt receive understanding: andif thou bow thine ear, thou shalt be wise,   

{6:34} Stand in the multitude of the elders; and cleave unto himthat is wise.   

{6:35} Be willing to hear every godly discourse; and let not theparables of understanding escape thee.   

{6:36} And if thou seest a man of understanding, get thee betimesunto him, and let thy foot wear the steps of his door.   

{6:37} Let thy mind be upon the ordinances of the Lord and meditatecontinually in his commandments: he shall establish thine heart, andgive thee wisdom at thine owns desire.   

{7:1} Do no evil, so shall no harm come unto thee.   

{7:2} Depart from the unjust, and iniquity shall turn away from thee.   

{7:3} My son, sow not upon the furrows of unrighteousness, and thoushalt not reap them sevenfold.   

{7:4} Seek not of the Lord preeminence, neither of the king the seatof honour.   

{7:5} justify not thyself before the Lord; and boast not of thywisdom before the king.   

{7:6} Seek not to be judge, being not able to take away iniquity;lest at any time thou fear the person of the mighty, an stumblingblockin the way of thy uprightness.   

{7:7} Offend not against the multitude of a city, and then thoushalt not cast thyself down among the people.   

{7:8} Bind not one sin upon another; for in one thou shalt not beunpunished.   

{7:9} Say not, God will look upon the multitude of my oblations, andwhen I offer to the most high God, he will accept it.   

{7:10} Be not fainthearted when thou makest thy prayer, and neglectnot to give alms.   

{7:11} Laugh no man to scorn in the bitterness of his soul: forthere is one which humbleth and exalteth.   

{7:12} Devise not a lie against thy brother; neither do the like tothy friend.   

{7:13} Use not to make any manner of lie: for the custom thereof isnot good.   

{7:14} Use not many words in a multitude of elders, and make notmuch babbling when thou prayest.   

{7:15} Hate not laborious work, neither husbandry, which the mostHigh hath ordained.   

{7:16} Number not thyself among the multitude of sinners, butremember that wrath will not tarry long.   

{7:17} Humble thyself greatly: for the vengeance of the ungodly isfire and worms.   

{7:18} Change not a friend for any good by no means; neither afaithful brother for the gold of Ophir.   

{7:19} Forego not a wise and good woman: for her grace is above gold.   

{7:20} Whereas thy servant worketh truly, entreat him not evil. northe hireling that bestoweth himself wholly for thee.   

{7:21} Let thy soul love a good servant, and defraud him not ofliberty.   

{7:22} Hast thou cattle? have an eye to them: and if they be for thyprofit, keep them with thee.   

{7:23} Hast thou children? instruct them, and bow down their neckfrom their youth.   

{7:24} Hast thou daughters? have a care of their body, and shew notthyself cheerful toward them.   

{7:25} Marry thy daughter, and so shalt thou have performed aweighty matter: but give her to a man of understanding.   

{7:26} Hast thou a wife after thy mind? forsake her not: but givenot thyself over to a light woman.   

{7:27} Honour thy father with thy whole heart, and forget not thesorrows of thy mother.   

{7:28} Remember that thou wast begotten of them; and how canst thourecompense them the things that they have done for thee?   

{7:29} Fear the Lord with all thy soul, and reverence his priests.   

{7:30} Love him that made thee with all thy strength, and forsakenot his ministers.   

{7:31} Fear the Lord, and honor the priest; and give him hisportion, as it is commanded thee; the firstfruits, and the trespassoffering, and the gift of the shoulders, and the sacrifice ofsanctification, and the firstfruits of the holy things.   

{7:32} And stretch thine hand unto the poor, that thy blessing maybe perfected.   

{7:33} A gift hath grace in the sight of every man living; and forthe dead detain it not.   

{7:34} Fail not to be with them that weep, and mourn with them thatmourn.   

{7:35} Be not slow to visit the sick: for that shall make thee to bebeloved.   

{7:36} Whatsoever thou takest in hand, remember the end, and thoushalt never do amiss.   

{8:1} Strive not with a mighty man' lest thou fall into his hands.   

{8:2} Be not at variance with a rich man, lest he overweigh thee:for gold hath destroyed many, and perverted the hearts of kings.   

{8:3} Strive not with a man that is full of tongue, and heap notwood upon his fire.   

{8:4} Jest not with a rude man, lest thy ancestors be disgraced.   

{8:5} Reproach not a man that turneth from sin, but remember that weare all worthy of punishment.   

{8:6} Dishonour not a man in his old age: for even some of us waxold.   

{8:7} Rejoice not over thy greatest enemy being dead, but rememberthat we die all.   

{8:8} Despise not the discourse of the wise, but acquaint thyselfwith their proverbs: for of them thou shalt learn instruction, and howto serve great men with ease.   

{8:9} Miss not the discourse of the elders: for they also learned oftheir fathers, and of them thou shalt learn understanding, and to giveanswer as need requireth.   

{8:10} Kindle not the coals of a sinner, lest thou be burnt with theflame of his fire.   

{8:11} Rise not up [in anger] at the presence of an injuriousperson, lest he lie in wait to entrap thee in thy words   

{8:12} Lend not unto him that is mightier than thyself; for if thoulendest him, count it but lost.   

{8:13} Be not surety above thy power: for if thou be surety, takecare to pay it.   

{8:14} Go not to law with a judge; for they will judge for himaccording to his honour.   

{8:15} Travel not by the way with a bold fellow, lest he becomegrievous unto thee: for he will do according to his own will, and thoushalt perish with him through his folly.   

{8:16} Strive not with an angry man, and go not with him into asolitary place: for blood is as nothing in his sight, and where thereis no help, he will overthrow thee.   

{8:17} Consult not with a fool; for he cannot keep counsel.   

{8:18} Do no secret thing before a stranger; for thou knowest notwhat he will bring forth.   

{8:19} Open not thine heart to every man, lest he requite thee witha shrewd turn.   

{9:1} Be not jealous over the wife of thy bosom, and teach her notan evil lesson against thyself.   

{9:2} Give not thy soul unto a woman to set her foot upon thysubstance.   

{9:3} Meet not with an harlot, lest thou fall into her snares.   

{9:4} Use not much the company of a woman that is a singer, lestthou be taken with her attempts.   

{9:5} Gaze not on a maid, that thou fall not by those things thatare precious in her.   

{9:6} Give not thy soul unto harlots, that thou lose not thineinheritance.   

{9:7} Look not round about thee in the streets of the city, neitherwander thou in the solitary place thereof.   

{9:8} Turn away thine eye from a beautiful woman, and look not uponanother's beauty; for many have been deceived by the beauty of a woman;for herewith love is kindled as a fire.   

{9:9} Sit not at all with another man's wife, nor sit down with herin thine arms, and spend not thy money with her at the wine; lest thineheart incline unto her, and so through thy desire thou fall intodestruction.   

{9:10} Forsake not an old friend; for the new is not comparable tohim: a new friend is as new wine; when it is old, thou shalt drink itwith pleasure.   

{9:11} Envy not the glory of a sinner: for thou knowest not whatshall be his end.   

{9:12} Delight not in the thing that the ungodly have pleasure in;but remember they shall not go unpunished unto their grave.   

{9:13} Keep thee far from the man that hath power to kill; so shaltthou not doubt the fear of death: and if thou come unto him, make nofault, lest he take away thy life presently: remember that thou goestin the midst of snares, and that thou walkest upon the battlements ofthe city.   

{9:14} As near as thou canst, guess at thy neighbour, and consultwith the wise.   

{9:15} Let thy talk be with the wise, and all thy communication inthe law of the most High.   

{9:16} And let just men eat and drink with thee; and let thyglorying be in the fear of the Lord.   

{9:17} For the hand of the artificer the work shall be commended:and the wise ruler of the people for his speech.   

{9:18} A man of an ill tongue is dangerous in his city; and he thatis rash in his talk shall be hated.   

{10:1} A wise judge will instruct his people; and the government ofa prudent man is well ordered.   

{10:2} As the judge of the people is himself, so are his officers;and what manner of man the ruler of the city is, such are all they thatdwell therein.   

{10:3} An unwise king destroyeth his people; but through theprudence of them which are in authority the city shall be inhabited.   

{10:4} The power of the earth is in the hand of the Lord, and in duetime he will set over it one that is profitable.   

{10:5} In the hand of God is the prosperity of man: and upon theperson of the scribe shall he lay his honour.   

{10:6} Bear not hatred to thy neighbour for every wrong; and donothing at all by injurious practices.   

{10:7} Pride is hateful before God and man: and by both doth onecommit iniquity.   

{10:8} Because of unrighteous dealings, injuries, and riches got bydeceit, the kingdom is translated from one people to another.   

{10:9} Why is earth and ashes proud? There is not a more wickedthing than a covetous man: for such an one setteth his own soul tosale; because while he liveth he casteth away his bowels.   

{10:10} The physician cutteth off a long disease; and he that is today a king to morrow shall die.   

{10:11} For when a man is dead, he shall inherit creeping things,beasts, and worms.   

{10:12} The beginning of pride is when one departeth from God, andhis heart is turned away from his Maker.   

{10:13} For pride is the beginning of sin, and he that hath it shallpour out abomination: and therefore the Lord brought upon them strangecalamities, and overthrew them utterly.   

{10:14} The Lord hath cast down the thrones of proud princes, andset up the meek in their stead.   

{10:15} The Lord hath plucked up the roots of the proud nations, andplanted the lowly in their place.   

{10:16} The Lord overthrew countries of the heathen, and destroyedthem to the foundations of the earth.   

{10:17} He took some of them away, and destroyed them, and hath madetheir memorial to cease from the earth.   

{10:18} Pride was not made for men, nor furious anger for them thatare born of a woman.   

{10:19} They that fear the Lord are a sure seed, and they that lovehim an honourable plant: they that regard not the law are adishonourable seed; they that transgress the commandments are adeceivable seed.   

{10:20} Among brethren he that is chief is honorable; so are theythat fear the Lord in his eyes.   

{10:21} The fear of the Lord goeth before the obtaining ofauthority: but roughness and pride is the losing thereof.   

{10:22} Whether he be rich, noble, or poor, their glory is the fearof the Lord.   

{10:23} It is not meet to despise the poor man that hathunderstanding; neither is it convenient to magnify a sinful man.   

{10:24} Great men, and judges, and potentates, shall be honoured;yet is there none of them greater than he that feareth the Lord.   

{10:25} Unto the servant that is wise shall they that are free doservice: and he that hath knowledge will not grudge when he is reformed.   

{10:26} Be not overwise in doing thy business; and boast not thyselfin the time of thy distress.   

{10:27} Better is he that laboureth, and aboundeth in all things,than he that boasteth himself, and wanteth bread.   

{10:28} My son, glorify thy soul in meekness, and give it honouraccording to the dignity thereof.   

{10:29} Who will justify him that sinneth against his own soul? andwho will honour him that dishonoureth his own life?   

{10:30} The poor man is honoured for his skill, and the rich man ishonoured for his riches.   

{10:31} He that is honoured in poverty, how much more in riches? andhe that is dishonourable in riches, how much more in poverty?   

{11:1} Wisdom lifteth up the head of him that is of low degree, andmaketh him to sit among great men.   

{11:2} Commend not a man for his beauty; neither abhor a man for hisoutward appearance.   

{11:3} The bee is little among such as fly; but her fruit is thechief of sweet things.   

{11:4} Boast not of thy clothing and raiment, and exalt not thyselfin the day of honour: for the works of the Lord are wonderful, and hisworks among men are hidden.   

{11:5} Many kings have sat down upon the ground; and one that wasnever thought of hath worn the crown.   

{11:6} Many mighty men have been greatly disgraced; and thehonourable delivered into other men's hands.   

{11:7} Blame not before thou hast examined the truth: understandfirst, and then rebuke.   

{11:8} Answer not before thou hast heard the cause: neitherinterrupt men in the midst of their talk.   

{11:9} Strive not in a matter that concerneth thee not; and sit notin judgment with sinners.   

{11:10} My son, meddle not with many matters: for if thou meddlemuch, thou shalt not be innocent; and if thou follow after, thou shaltnot obtain, neither shalt thou escape by fleeing.   

{11:11} There is one that laboureth, and taketh pains, and makethhaste, and is so much the more behind.   

{11:12} Again, there is another that is slow, and hath need of help,wanting ability, and full of poverty; yet the eye of the Lord lookedupon him for good, and set him up from his low estate,   

{11:13} And lifted up his head from misery; so that many that sawfrom him is peace over all the   

{11:14} Prosperity and adversity, life and death, poverty andriches, come of the Lord.   

{11:15} Wisdom, knowledge, and understanding of the law, are of theLord: love, and the way of good works, are from him.   

{11:16} Error and darkness had their beginning together withsinners: and evil shall wax old with them that glory therein.   

{11:17} The gift of the Lord remaineth with the ungodly, and hisfavour bringeth prosperity for ever.   

{11:18} There is that waxeth rich by his wariness and pinching, andthis his the portion of his reward:   

{11:19} Whereas he saith, I have found rest, and now will eatcontinually of my goods; and yet he knoweth not what time shall comeupon him, and that he must leave those things to others, and die.   

{11:20} Be stedfast in thy covenant, and be conversant therein, andwax old in thy work.   

{11:21} Marvel not at the works of sinners; but trust in the Lord,and abide in thy labour: for it is an easy thing in the sight of theLord on the sudden to make a poor man rich.   

{11:22} The blessing of the Lord is in the reward of the godly, andsuddenly he maketh his blessing flourish.   

{11:23} Say not, What profit is there of my service? and what goodthings shall I have hereafter?   

{11:24} Again, say not, I have enough, and possess many things, andwhat evil shall I have hereafter?   

{11:25} In the day of prosperity there is a forgetfulness ofaffliction: and in the day of affliction there is no more remembranceof prosperity.   

{11:26} For it is an easy thing unto the Lord in the day of death toreward a man according to his ways.   

{11:27} The affliction of an hour maketh a man forget pleasure: andin his end his deeds shall be discovered.   

{11:28} Judge none blessed before his death: for a man shall beknown in his children.   

{11:29} Bring not every man into thine house: for the deceitful manhath many trains.   

{11:30} Like as a partridge taken [and kept] in a cage, so is theheart of the proud; and like as a spy, watcheth he for thy fall:   

{11:31} For he lieth in wait, and turneth good into evil, and inthings worthy praise will lay blame upon thee.   

{11:32} Of a spark of fire a heap of coals is kindled: and a sinfulman layeth wait for blood.   

{11:33} Take heed of a mischievous man, for he worketh wickedness;lest he bring upon thee a perpetual blot.   

{11:34} Receive a stranger into thine house, and he will disturbthee, and turn thee out of thine own.   

{12:1} When thou wilt do good know to whom thou doest it; so shaltthou be thanked for thy benefits.   

{12:2} Do good to the godly man, and thou shalt find a recompence;and if not from him, yet from the most High.   

{12:3} There can no good come to him that is always occupied inevil, nor to him that giveth no alms.   

{12:4} Give to the godly man, and help not a sinner.   

{12:5} Do well unto him that is lowly, but give not to the ungodly:hold back thy bread, and give it not unto him, lest he overmaster theethereby: for [else] thou shalt receive twice as much evil for all thegood thou shalt have done unto him.   

{12:6} For the most High hateth sinners, and will repay vengeanceunto the ungodly, and keepeth them against the mighty day of theirpunishment.   

{12:7} Give unto the good, and help not the sinner.   

{12:8} A friend cannot be known in prosperity: and an enemy cannotbe hidden in adversity.   

{12:9} In the prosperity of a man enemies will be grieved: but inhis adversity even a friend will depart.   

{12:10} Never trust thine enemy: for like as iron rusteth, so is hiswickedness.   

{12:11} Though he humble himself, and go crouching, yet take goodheed and beware of him, and thou shalt be unto him as if thou hadstwiped a lookingglass, and thou shalt know that his rust hath not beenaltogether wiped away.   

{12:12} Set him not by thee, lest, when he hath overthrown thee, hestand up in thy place; neither let him sit at thy right hand, lest heseek to take thy seat, and thou at the last remember my words, and bepricked therewith.   

{12:13} Who will pity a charmer that is bitten with a serpent, orany such as come nigh wild beasts?   

{12:14} So one that goeth to a sinner, and is defiled with him inhis sins, who will pity?   

{12:15} For a while he will abide with thee, but if thou begin tofall, he will not tarry.   

{12:16} An enemy speaketh sweetly with his lips, but in his heart heimagineth how to throw thee into a pit: he will weep with his eyes, butif he find opportunity, he will not be satisfied with blood.   

{12:17} If adversity come upon thee, thou shalt find him therefirst; and though he pretend to help thee, yet shall he undermine thee.   

{12:18} He will shake his head, and clap his hands, and whispermuch, and change his countenance.   

{13:1} He that toucheth pitch shall be defiled therewith; and hethat hath fellowship with a proud man shall be like unto him.   

{13:2} Burden not thyself above thy power while thou livest; andhave no fellowship with one that is mightier and richer than thyself:for how agree the kettle and the earthen pot together? for if the onebe smitten against the other, it shall be broken.   

{13:3} The rich man hath done wrong, and yet he threateneth withal:the poor is wronged, and he must intreat also.   

{13:4} If thou be for his profit, he will use thee: but if thou havenothing, he will forsake thee.   

{13:5} If thou have any thing, he will live with thee: yea, he willmake thee bare, and will not be sorry for it.   

{13:6} If he have need of thee, he will deceive thee, and smile uponthee, and put thee in hope; he will speak thee fair, and say, Whatwantest thou?   

{13:7} And he will shame thee by his meats, until he have drawn theedry twice or thrice, and at the last he will laugh thee to scornafterward, when he seeth thee, he will forsake thee, and shake his headat thee.   

{13:8} Beware that thou be not deceived and brought down in thyjollity.   

{13:9} If thou be invited of a mighty man, withdraw thyself, and somuch the more will he invite thee.   

{13:10} Press thou not upon him, lest thou be put back; stand notfar off, lest thou be forgotten.   

{13:11} Affect not to be made equal unto him in talk, and believenot his many words: for with much communication will he tempt thee, andsmiling upon thee will get out thy secrets:   

{13:12} But cruelly he will lay up thy words, and will not spare todo thee hurt, and to put thee in prison.   

{13:13} Observe, and take good heed, for thou walkest in peril ofthy overthrowing: when thou hearest these things, awake in thy sleep.   

{13:14} Love the Lord all thy life, and call upon him for thysalvation.   

{13:15} Every beast loveth his like, and every man loveth hisneighbor.   

{13:16} All flesh consorteth according to kind, and a man willcleave to his like.   

{13:17} What fellowship hath the wolf with the lamb? so the sinnerwith the godly.   

{13:18} What agreement is there between the hyena and a dog? andwhat peace between the rich and the poor?   

{13:19} As the wild ass is the lion's prey in the wilderness: so therich eat up the poor.   

{13:20} As the proud hate humility: so doth the rich abhor the poor.   

{13:21} A rich man beginning to fall is held up of his friends: buta poor man being down is thrust away by his friends.   

{13:22} When a rich man is fallen, he hath many helpers: he speakeththings not to be spoken, and yet men justify him: the poor man slipped,and yet they rebuked him too; he spake wisely, and could have no place.   

{13:23} When a rich man speaketh, every man holdeth his tongue, and,look, what he saith, they extol it to the clouds: but if the poor manspeak, they say, What fellow is this? and if he stumble, they will helpto overthrow him.   

{13:24} Riches are good unto him that hath no sin, and poverty isevil in the mouth of the ungodly.   

{13:25} The heart of a man changeth his countenance, whether it befor good or evil: and a merry heart maketh a cheerful countenance.   

{13:26} A cheerful countenance is a token of a heart that is inprosperity; and the finding out of parables is a wearisome labour ofthe mind.   

{14:1} Blessed is the man that hath not slipped with his mouth, andis not pricked with the multitude of sins.   

{14:2} Blessed is he whose conscience hath not condemned him, andwho is not fallen from his hope in the Lord.   

{14:3} Riches are not comely for a niggard: and what should anenvious man do with money?   

{14:4} He that gathereth by defrauding his own soul gathereth forothers, that shall spend his goods riotously.   

{14:5} He that is evil to himself, to whom will he be good? he shallnot take pleasure in his goods.   

{14:6} There is none worse than he that envieth himself; and this isa recompence of his wickedness.   

{14:7} And if he doeth good, he doeth it unwillingly; and at thelast he will declare his wickedness.   

{14:8} The envious man hath a wicked eye; he turneth away his face,and despiseth men.   

{14:9} A covetous man's eye is not satisfied with his portion; andthe iniquity of the wicked drieth up his soul.   

{14:10} A wicked eye envieth [his] bread, and he is a niggard at histable.   

{14:11} My son, according to thy ability do good to thyself, andgive the Lord his due offering.   

{14:12} Remember that death will not be long in coming, and that thecovenant of the grave is not shewed unto thee.   

{14:13} Do good unto thy friend before thou die, and according tothy ability stretch out thy hand and give to him.   

{14:14} Defraud not thyself of the good day, and let not the part ofa good desire overpass thee.   

{14:15} Shalt thou not leave thy travails unto another? and thylabours to be divided by lot?   

{14:16} Give, and take, and sanctify thy soul; for there is noseeking of dainties in the grave.   

{14:17} All flesh waxeth old as a garment: for the covenant from thebeginning is, Thou shalt die the death.   

{14:18} As of the green leaves on a thick tree, some fall, and somegrow; so is the generation of flesh and blood, one cometh to an end,and another is born.   

{14:19} Every work rotteth and consumeth away, and the workerthereof shall go withal.   

{14:20} Blessed is the man that doth meditate good things in wisdom,and that reasoneth of holy things by his understanding. ing.   

{14:21} He that considereth her ways in his heart shall also haveunderstanding in her secrets.   

{14:22} Go after her as one that traceth, and lie in wait in herways.   

{14:23} He that prieth in at her windows shall also hearken at herdoors.   

{14:24} He that doth lodge near her house shall also fasten a pin inher walls.   

{14:25} He shall pitch his tent nigh unto her, and shall lodge in alodging where good things are.   

{14:26} He shall set his children under her shelter, and shall lodgeunder her branches.   

{14:27} By her he shall be covered from heat, and in her glory shallhe dwell.   

{15:1} He that feareth the Lord will do good, and he that hath theknowledge of the law shall obtain her.   

{15:2} And as a mother shall she meet him, and receive him as a wifemarried of a virgin.   

{15:3} With the bread of understanding shall she feed him, and givehim the water of wisdom to drink.   

{15:4} He shall be stayed upon her, and shall not be moved; andshall rely upon her, and shall not be confounded.   

{15:5} She shall exalt him above his neighbours, and in the midst ofthe congregation shall she open his mouth.   

{15:6} He shall find joy and a crown of gladness, and she shallcause him to inherit an everlasting name.   

{15:7} But foolish men shall not attain unto her, and sinners shallnot see her.   

{15:8} For she is far from pride, and men that are liars cannotremember her.   

{15:9} Praise is not seemly in the mouth of a sinner, for it was notsent him of the Lord.   

{15:10} For praise shall be uttered in wisdom, and the Lord willprosper it.   

{15:11} Say not thou, It is through the Lord that I fell away: forthou oughtest not to do the things that he hateth.   

{15:12} Say not thou, He hath caused me to err: for he hath no needof the sinful man.   

{15:13} The Lord hateth all abomination; and they that fear God loveit not.   

{15:14} He himself made man from the beginning, and left him in thehand of his counsel;   

{15:15} If thou wilt, to keep the commandments, and to performacceptable faithfulness.   

{15:16} He hath set fire and water before thee: stretch forth thyhand unto whether thou wilt.   

{15:17} Before man is life and death; and whether him liketh shallbe given him.   

{15:18} For the wisdom of the Lord is great, and he is mighty inpower, and beholdeth all things:   

{15:19} And his eyes are upon them that fear him, and he knowethevery work of man.   

{15:20} He hath commanded no man to do wickedly, neither hath hegiven any man licence to sin.   

{16:1} Desire not a multitude of unprofitable children, neitherdelight in ungodly sons.   

{16:2} Though they multiply, rejoice not in them, except the fear ofthe Lord be with them.   

{16:3} Trust not thou in their life, neither respect theirmultitude: for one that is just is better than a thousand; and betterit is to die without children, than to have them that are ungodly.   

{16:4} For by one that hath understanding shall the city bereplenished: but the kindred of the wicked shall speedily becomedesolate.   

{16:5} Many such things have I seen with mine eyes, and mine earhath heard greater things than these.   

{16:6} In the congregation of the ungodly shall a fire be kindled;and in a rebellious nation wrath is set on fire.   

{16:7} He was not pacified toward the old giants, who fell away inthe strength of their foolishness.   

{16:8} Neither spared he the place where Lot sojourned, but abhorredthem for their pride.   

{16:9} He pitied not the people of perdition, who were taken away intheir sins:   

{16:10} Nor the six hundred thousand footmen, who were gatheredtogether in the hardness of their hearts.   

{16:11} And if there be one stiffnecked among the people, it ismarvel if he escape unpunished: for mercy and wrath are with him; he ismighty to forgive, and to pour out displeasure.   

{16:12} As his mercy is great, so is his correction also: he judgetha man according to his works   

{16:13} The sinner shall not escape with his spoils: and thepatience of the godly shall not be frustrate.   

{16:14} Make way for every work of mercy: for every man shall findaccording to his works.   

{16:15} The Lord hardened Pharaoh, that he should not know him, thathis powerful works might be known to the world.   

{16:16} His mercy is manifest to every creature; and he hathseparated his light from the darkness with an adamant.   

{16:17} Say not thou, I will hide myself from the Lord: shall anyremember me from above? I shall not be remembered among so many people:for what is my soul among such an infinite number of creatures?   

{16:18} Behold, the heaven, and the heaven of heavens, the deep, andthe earth, and all that therein is, shall be moved when he shall visit.   

{16:19} The mountains also and foundations of the earth be shakenwith trembling, when the Lord looketh upon them.   

{16:20} No heart can think upon these things worthily: and who isable to conceive his ways?   

{16:21} It is a tempest which no man can see: for the most part ofhis works are hid.   

{16:22} Who can declare the works of his justice? or who can endurethem? for his covenant is afar off, and the trial of all things is inthe end.   

{16:23} He that wanteth understanding will think upon vain things:and a foolish man erring imagineth follies.   

{16:24} by son, hearken unto me, and learn knowledge, and mark mywords with thy heart.   

{16:25} I will shew forth doctrine in weight, and declare hisknowledge exactly.   

{16:26} The works of the Lord are done in judgment from thebeginning: and from the time he made them he disposed the parts thereof.   

{16:27} He garnished his works for ever, and in his hand are thechief of them unto all generations: they neither labour, nor are weary,nor cease from their works.   

{16:28} None of them hindereth another, and they shall never disobeyhis word.   

{16:29} After this the Lord looked upon the earth, and filled itwith his blessings.   

{16:30} With all manner of living things hath he covered the facethereof; and they shall return into it again.   

{17:1} The Lord created man of the earth, and turned him into itagain.   

{17:2} He gave them few days, and a short time, and power also overthe things therein.   

{17:3} He endued them with strength by themselves, and made themaccording to his image,   

{17:4} And put the fear of man upon all flesh, and gave him dominionover beasts and fowls.   

{17:5} They received the use of the five operations of the Lord, andin the sixth place he imparted them understanding, and in the seventhspeech, an interpreter of the cogitations thereof.   

{17:6} Counsel, and a tongue, and eyes, ears, and a heart, gave hethem to understand.   

{17:7} Withal he filled them with the knowledge of understanding,and shewed them good and evil.   

{17:8} He set his eye upon their hearts, that he might shew them thegreatness of his works.   

{17:9} He gave them to glory in his marvellous acts for ever, thatthey might declare his works with understanding.   

{17:10} And the elect shall praise his holy name.   

{17:11} Beside this he gave them knowledge, and the law of life foran heritage.   

{17:12} He made an everlasting covenant with them, and shewed themhis judgments.   

{17:13} Their eyes saw the majesty of his glory, and their earsheard his glorious voice.   

{17:14} And he said unto them, Beware of all unrighteousness; and hegave every man commandment concerning his neighbour.   

{17:15} Their ways are ever before him, and shall not be hid fromhis eyes.   

{17:16} Every man from his youth is given to evil; neither couldthey make to themselves fleshy hearts for stony.   

{17:17} For in the division of the nations of the whole earth he seta ruler over every people; but Israel is the Lord's portion:   

{17:18} Whom, being his firstborn, he nourisheth with discipline,and giving him the light of his love doth not forsake him.   

{17:19} Therefore all their works are as the sun before him, and hiseyes are continually upon their ways.   

{17:20} None of their unrighteous deeds are hid from him, but alltheir sins are before the Lord   

{17:21} But the Lord being gracious and knowing his workmanship,neither left nor forsook them, but spared them.   

{17:22} The alms of a man is as a signet with him, and he will keepthe good deeds of man as the apple of the eye, and give repentance tohis sons and daughters.   

{17:23} Afterwards he will rise up and reward them, and render theirrecompence upon their heads.   

{17:24} But unto them that repent, he granted them return, andcomforted those that failed in patience.   

{17:25} Return unto the Lord, and forsake thy sins, make thy prayerbefore his face, and offend less.   

{17:26} Turn again to the most High, and turn away from iniquity:for he will lead thee out of darkness into the light of health, andhate thou abomination vehemently.   

{17:27} Who shall praise the most High in the grave, instead of themwhich live and give thanks?   

{17:28} Thanksgiving perisheth from the dead, as from one that isnot: the living and sound in heart shall praise the Lord.   

{17:29} How great is the lovingkindness of the Lord our God, and hiscompassion unto such as turn unto him in holiness!   

{17:30} For all things cannot be in men, because the son of man isnot immortal.   

{17:31} What is brighter than the sun? yet the light thereoffaileth; and flesh and blood will imagine evil.   

{17:32} He vieweth the power of the height of heaven; and all menare but earth and ashes.   

{18:1} He that liveth for ever Hath created all things in general.   

{18:2} The Lord only is righteous, and there is none other but he,   

{18:3} Who governeth the world with the palm of his hand, and allthings obey his will: for he is the King of all, by his power dividingholy things among them from profane.   

{18:4} To whom hath he given power to declare his works? and whoshall find out his noble acts?   

{18:5} Who shall number the strength of his majesty? and who shallalso tell out his mercies?   

{18:6} As for the wondrous works of the Lord, there may nothing betaken from them, neither may any thing be put unto them, neither canthe ground of them be found out.   

{18:7} When a man hath done, then he beginneth; and when he leavethoff, then he shall be doubtful.   

{18:8} What is man, and whereto serveth he? what is his good, andwhat is his evil?   

{18:9} The number of a man's days at the most are an hundred years.   

{18:10} As a drop of water unto the sea, and a gravelstone incomparison of the sand; so are a thousand years to the days of eternity.   

{18:11} Therefore is God patient with them, and poureth forth hismercy upon them.   

{18:12} He saw and perceived their end to be evil; therefore hemultiplied his compassion.   

{18:13} The mercy of man is toward his neighbour; but the mercy ofthe Lord is upon all flesh: he reproveth, and nurtureth, and teachethand bringeth again, as a shepherd his flock.   

{18:14} He hath mercy on them that receive discipline, and thatdiligently seek after his judgments.   

{18:15} My son, blemish not thy good deeds, neither useuncomfortable words when thou givest any thing.   

{18:16} Shall not the dew asswage the heat? so is a word better thana gift.   

{18:17} Lo, is not a word better than a gift? but both are with agracious man.   

{18:18} A fool will upbraid churlishly, and a gift of the enviousconsumeth the eyes.   

{18:19} Learn before thou speak, and use physick or ever thou besick.   

{18:20} Before judgment examine thyself, and in the day ofvisitation thou shalt find mercy.   

{18:21} Humble thyself before thou be sick, and in the time of sinsshew repentance.   

{18:22} Let nothing hinder thee to pay thy vow in due time, anddefer not until death to be justified.   

{18:23} Before thou prayest, prepare thyself; and be not as one thattempteth the Lord.   

{18:24} Think upon the wrath that shall be at the end, and the timeof vengeance, when he shall turn away his face.   

{18:25} When thou hast enough, remember the time of hunger: and whenthou art rich, think upon poverty and need.   

{18:26} From the morning until the evening the time is changed, andall things are soon done before the Lord.   

{18:27} A wise man will fear in every thing, and in the day ofsinning he will beware of offence: but a fool will not observe time.   

{18:28} Every man of understanding knoweth wisdom, and will givepraise unto him that found her.   

{18:29} They that were of understanding in sayings became also wisethemselves, and poured forth exquisite parables.   

{18:30} Go not after thy lusts, but refrain thyself from thineappetites.   

{18:31} If thou givest thy soul the desires that please her, shewill make thee a laughingstock to thine enemies that malign thee.   

{18:32} Take not pleasure in much good cheer, neither be tied to theexpence thereof.   

{18:33} Be not made a beggar by banqueting upon borrowing, when thouhast nothing in thy purse: for thou shalt lie in wait for thine ownlife, and be talked on.   

{19:1} A labouring man that A is given to drunkenness shall not berich: and he that contemneth small things shall fall by little andlittle.   

{19:2} Wine and women will make men of understanding to fall away:and he that cleaveth to harlots will become impudent.   

{19:3} Moths and worms shall have him to heritage, and a bold manshall be taken away.   

{19:4} He that is hasty to give credit is lightminded; and he thatsinneth shall offend against his own soul.   

{19:5} Whoso taketh pleasure in wickedness shall be condemned: buthe that resisteth pleasures crowneth his life.   

{19:6} He that can rule his tongue shall live without strife; and hethat hateth babbling shall have less evil.   

{19:7} Rehearse not unto another that which is told unto thee, andthou shalt fare never the worse.   

{19:8} Whether it be to friend or foe, talk not of other men'slives; and if thou canst without offence, reveal them not.   

{19:9} For he heard and observed thee, and when time cometh he willhate thee.   

{19:10} If thou hast heard a word, let it die with thee; and bebold, it will not burst thee.   

{19:11} A fool travaileth with a word, as a woman in labour of achild.   

{19:12} As an arrow that sticketh in a man's thigh, so is a wordwithin a fool's belly.   

{19:13} Admonish a friend, it may be he hath not done it: and if hehave done it, that he do it no more.   

{19:14} Admonish thy friend, it may be he hath not said it: and ifhe have, that he speak it not again.   

{19:15} Admonish a friend: for many times it is a slander, andbelieve not every tale.   

{19:16} There is one that slippeth in his speech, but not from hisheart; and who is he that hath not offended with his tongue?   

{19:17} Admonish thy neighbour before thou threaten him; and notbeing angry, give place to the law of the most High.   

{19:18} The fear of the Lord is the first step to be accepted [ofhim,] and wisdom obtaineth his love.   

{19:19} The knowledge of the commandments of the Lord is thedoctrine of life: and they that do things that please him shall receivethe fruit of the tree of immortality.   

{19:20} The fear of the Lord is all wisdom; and in all wisdom is theperformance of the law, and the knowledge of his omnipotency.   

{19:21} If a servant say to his master, I will not do as it pleaseththee; though afterward he do it, he angereth him that nourisheth him.   

{19:22} The knowledge of wickedness is not wisdom, neither at anytime the counsel of sinners prudence.   

{19:23} There is a wickedness, and the same an abomination; andthere is a fool wanting in wisdom.   

{19:24} He that hath small understanding, and feareth God, is betterthan one that hath much wisdom, and transgresseth the law of the mostHigh.   

{19:25} There is an exquisite subtilty, and the same is unjust; andthere is one that turneth aside to make judgment appear; and there is awise man that justifieth in judgment.   

{19:26} There is a wicked man that hangeth down his head sadly; butinwardly he is full of deceit,   

{19:27} Casting down his countenance, and making as if he heard not:where he is not known, he will do thee a mischief before thou be aware.   

{19:28} And if for want of power he be hindered from sinning, yetwhen he findeth opportunity he will do evil.   

{19:29} A man may be known by his look, and one that hathunderstanding by his countenance, when thou meetest him.   

{19:30} A man's attire, and excessive laughter, and gait, shew whathe is.   

{20:1} There is a reproof that is not comely: again, some manholdeth his tongue, and he is wise.   

{20:2} It is much better to reprove, than to be angry secretly: andhe that confesseth his fault shall be preserved from hurt.   

{20:3} How good is it, when thou art reproved, to shew repentance!for so shalt thou escape wilful sin.   

{20:4} As is the lust of an eunuch to deflower a virgin; so is hethat executeth judgment with violence.   

{20:5} There is one that keepeth silence, and is found wise: andanother by much babbling becometh hateful.   

{20:6} Some man holdeth his tongue, because he hath not to answer:and some keepeth silence, knowing his time.   

{20:7} A wise man will hold his tongue till he see opportunity: buta babbler and a fool will regard no time.   

{20:8} He that useth many words shall be abhorred; and he thattaketh to himself authority therein shall be hated.   

{20:9} There is a sinner that hath good success in evil things; andthere is a gain that turneth to loss.   

{20:10} There is a gift that shall not profit thee; and there is agift whose recompence is double.   

{20:11} There is an abasement because of glory; and there is thatlifteth up his head from a low estate.   

{20:12} There is that buyeth much for a little, and repayeth itsevenfold.   

{20:13} A wise man by his words maketh him beloved: but the gracesof fools shall be poured out.   

{20:14} The gift of a fool shall do thee no good when thou hast it;neither yet of the envious for his necessity: for he looketh to receivemany things for one.   

{20:15} He giveth little, and upbraideth much; he openeth his mouthlike a crier; to day he lendeth, and to morrow will he ask it again:such an one is to be hated of God and man.   

{20:16} The fool saith, I have no friends, I have no thank for allmy good deeds, and they that eat my bread speak evil of me.   

{20:17} How oft, and of how many shall he be laughed to scorn! forhe knoweth not aright what it is to have; and it is all one unto him asif he had it not.   

{20:18} To slip upon a pavement is better than to slip with thetongue: so the fall of the wicked shall come speedily.   

{20:19} An unseasonable tale will always be in the mouth of theunwise.   

{20:20} A wise sentence shall be rejected when it cometh out of afool's mouth; for he will not speak it in due season.   

{20:21} There is that is hindered from sinning through want: andwhen he taketh rest, he shall not be troubled.   

{20:22} There is that destroyeth his own soul through bashfulness,and by accepting of persons overthroweth himself.   

{20:23} There is that for bashfulness promiseth to his friend, andmaketh him his enemy for nothing.   

{20:24} A lie is a foul blot in a man, yet it is continually in themouth of the untaught.   

{20:25} A thief is better than a man that is accustomed to lie: butthey both shall have destruction to heritage.   

{20:26} The disposition of a liar is dishonourable, and his shame isever with him.   

{20:27} A wise man shall promote himself to honour with his words:and he that hath understanding will please great men.   

{20:28} He that tilleth his land shall increase his heap: and hethat pleaseth great men shall get pardon for iniquity.   

{20:29} Presents and gifts blind the eyes of the wise, and stop uphis mouth that he cannot reprove.   

{20:30} Wisdom that is hid, and treasure that is hoarded up, whatprofit is in them both?   

{20:31} Better is he that hideth his folly than a man that hidethhis wisdom.   

{20:32} Necessary patience in seeking ing the Lord is better than hethat leadeth his life without a guide.   

{21:1} My son, hast thou sinned? do so no more, but ask pardon forthy former sins.   

{21:2} Flee from sin as from the face of a serpent: for if thoucomest too near it, it will bite thee: the teeth thereof are as theteeth of a lion, slaying the souls of men.   

{21:3} All iniquity is as a two edged sword, the wounds whereofcannot be healed.   

{21:4} To terrify and do wrong will waste riches: thus the house ofproud men shall be made desolate.   

{21:5} A prayer out of a poor man's mouth reacheth to the ears ofGod, and his judgment cometh speedily.   

{21:6} He that hateth to be reproved is in the way of sinners: buthe that feareth the Lord will repent from his heart.   

{21:7} An eloquent man is known far and near; but a man ofunderstanding knoweth when he slippeth.   

{21:8} He that buildeth his house with other men's money is like onethat gathereth himself stones for the tomb of his burial.   

{21:9} The congregation of the wicked is like tow wrapped together:and the end of them is a flame of fire to destroy them.   

{21:10} The way of sinners is made plain with stones, but at the endthereof is the pit of hell.   

{21:11} He that keepeth the law of the Lord getteth theunderstanding thereof: and the perfection of the fear of the Lord iswisdom.   

{21:12} He that is not wise will not be taught: but there is awisdom which multiplieth bitterness.   

{21:13} The knowledge of a wise man shall abound like a flood: andhis counsel is like a pure fountain of life.   

{21:14} The inner parts of a fool are like a broken vessel, and hewill hold no knowledge as long as he liveth.   

{21:15} If a skilful man hear a wise word, he will commend it, andadd unto it: but as soon as one of no understanding heareth it, itdispleaseth him, and he casteth it behind his back.   

{21:16} The talking of a fool is like a burden in the way: but graceshall be found in the lips of the wise.   

{21:17} They enquire at the mouth of the wise man in thecongregation, and they shall ponder his words in their heart.   

{21:18} As is a house that is destroyed, so is wisdom to a fool: andthe knowledge of the unwise is as talk without sense.   

{21:19} Doctrine unto fools is as fetters on the feet, and likemanacles on the right hand.   

{21:20} A fool lifteth up his voice with laughter; but a wise mandoth scarce smile a little.   

{21:21} Learning is unto a wise man as an ornament of gold, and likea bracelet upon his right arm.   

{21:22} A foolish man's foot is soon in his [neighbour's] house: buta man of experience is ashamed of him.   

{21:23} A fool will peep in at the door into the house: but he thatis well nurtured will stand without.   

{21:24} It is the rudeness of a man to hearken at the door: but awise man will be grieved with the disgrace.   

{21:25} The lips of talkers will be telling such things as pertainnot unto them: but the words of such as have understanding are weighedin the balance.   

{21:26} The heart of fools is in their mouth: but the mouth of thewise is in their heart.   

{21:27} When the ungodly curseth Satan, he curseth his own soul.   

{21:28} A whisperer defileth his own soul, and is hated wheresoeverhe dwelleth.   

{22:1} A slothful man is compared to a filthy stone, and every onewill hiss him out to his disgrace.   

{22:2} A slothful man is compared to the filth of a dunghill: everyman that takes it up will shake his hand.   

{22:3} An evilnurtured man is the dishonour of his father that begathim: and a [foolish] daughter is born to his loss.   

{22:4} A wise daughter shall bring an inheritance to her husband:but she that liveth dishonestly is her father's heaviness.   

{22:5} She that is bold dishonoureth both her father and herhusband, but they both shall despise her.   

{22:6} A tale out of season [is as] musick in mourning: but stripesand correction of wisdom are never out of time.   

{22:7} Whoso teacheth a fool is as one that glueth a potsherdtogether, and as he that waketh one from a sound sleep.   

{22:8} He that telleth a tale to a fool speaketh to one in aslumber: when he hath told his tale, he will say, What is the matter?   

{22:9} If children live honestly, and have wherewithal, they shallcover the baseness of their parents.   

{22:10} But children, being haughty, through disdain and want ofnurture do stain the nobility of their kindred.   

{22:11} Weep for the dead, for he hath lost the light: and weep forthe fool, for he wanteth understanding: make little weeping for thedead, for he is at rest: but the life of the fool is worse than death.   

{22:12} Seven days do men mourn for him that is dead; but for a fooland an ungodly man all the days of his life.   

{22:13} Talk not much with a fool, and go not to him that hath nounderstanding: beware of him, lest thou have trouble, and thou shaltnever be defiled with his fooleries: depart from him, and thou shaltfind rest, and never be disquieted with madness.   

{22:14} What is heavier than lead? and what is the name thereof, buta fool?   

{22:15} Sand, and salt, and a mass of iron, is easier to bear, thana man without understanding.   

{22:16} As timber girt and bound together in a building cannot beloosed with shaking: so the heart that is stablished by advised counselshall fear at no time.   

{22:17} A heart settled upon a thought of understanding is as a fairplaistering on the wall of a gallery.   

{22:18} Pales set on an high place will never stand against thewind: so a fearful heart in the imagination of a fool cannot standagainst any fear.   

{22:19} He that pricketh the eye will make tears to fall: and hethat pricketh the heart maketh it to shew her knowledge.   

{22:20} Whoso casteth a stone at the birds frayeth them away: and hethat upbraideth his friend breaketh friendship.   

{22:21} Though thou drewest a sword at thy friend, yet despair not:for there may be a returning [to favour.]   

{22:22} If thou hast opened thy mouth against thy friend, fear not;for there may be a reconciliation: except for upbraiding, or pride, ordisclosing of secrets, or a treacherous wound: for for these thingsevery friend will depart.   

{22:23} Be faithful to thy neighbour in his poverty, that thoumayest rejoice in his prosperity: abide stedfast unto him in the timeof his trouble, that thou mayest be heir with him in his heritage: fora mean estate is not always to be contemned: nor the rich that isfoolish to be had in admiration.   

{22:24} As the vapour and smoke of a furnace goeth before the fire;so reviling before blood.   

{22:25} I will not be ashamed to defend a friend; neither will Ihide myself from him.   

{22:26} And if any evil happen unto me by him, every one thatheareth it will beware of him.   

{22:27} Who shall set a watch before my mouth, and a seal of wisdomupon my lips, that I fall not suddenly by them, and that my tonguedestroy me not?   

{23:1} O Lord, Father and Governor of all my whole life, leave menot to their counsels, and let me not fall by them.   

{23:2} Who will set scourges over my thoughts, and the discipline ofwisdom over mine heart? that they spare me not for mine ignorances, andit pass not by my sins:   

{23:3} Lest mine ignorances increase, and my sins abound to mydestruction, and I fall before mine adversaries, and mine enemy rejoiceover me, whose hope is far from thy mercy.   

{23:4} O Lord, Father and God of my life, give me not a proud look,but turn away from thy servants always a haughty mind.   

{23:5} Turn away from me vain hopes and concupiscence, and thoushalt hold him up that is desirous always to serve thee.   

{23:6} Let not the greediness of the belly nor lust of the fleshtake hold of me; and give not over me thy servant into an impudent mind.   

{23:7} Hear, O ye children, the discipline of the mouth: he thatkeepeth it shall never be taken in his lips.   

{23:8} The sinner shall be left in his foolishness: both the evilspeaker and the proud shall fall thereby.   

{23:9} Accustom not thy mouth to swearing; neither use thyself tothe naming of the Holy One.   

{23:10} For as a servant that is continually beaten shall not bewithout a blue mark: so he that sweareth and nameth God continuallyshall not be faultless.   

{23:11} A man that useth much swearing shall be filled withiniquity, and the plague shall never depart from his house: if he shalloffend, his sin shall be upon him: and if he acknowledge not his sin,he maketh a double offence: and if he swear in vain, he shall not beinnocent, but his house shall be full of calamities.   

{23:12} There is a word that is clothed about with death: God grantthat it be not found in the heritage of Jacob; for all such thingsshall be far from the godly, and they shall not wallow in their sins.   

{23:13} Use not thy mouth to intemperate swearing, for therein isthe word of sin.   

{23:14} Remember thy father and thy mother, when thou sittest amonggreat men. Be not forgetful before them, and so thou by thy custombecome a fool, and wish that thou hadst not been born, and curse theyday of thy nativity.   

{23:15} The man that is accustomed to opprobrious words will neverbe reformed all the days of his life.   

{23:16} Two sorts of men multiply sin, and the third will bringwrath: a hot mind is as a burning fire, it will never be quenched tillit be consumed: a fornicator in the body of his flesh will never ceasetill he hath kindled a fire.   

{23:17} All bread is sweet to a whoremonger, he will not leave offtill he die.   

{23:18} A man that breaketh wedlock, saying thus in his heart, Whoseeth me? I am compassed about with darkness, the walls cover me, andno body seeth me; what need I to fear? the most High will not remembermy sins:   

{23:19} Such a man only feareth the eyes of men, and knoweth notthat the eyes of the Lord are ten thousand times brighter than the sun,beholding all the ways of men, and considering the most secret parts.   

{23:20} He knew all things ere ever they were created; so also afterthey were perfected he looked upon them all.   

{23:21} This man shall be punished in the streets of the city, andwhere he suspecteth not he shall be taken.   

{23:22} Thus shall it go also with the wife that leaveth herhusband, and bringeth in an heir by another.   

{23:23} For first, she hath disobeyed the law of the most High; andsecondly, she hath trespassed against her own husband; and thirdly, shehath played the whore in adultery, and brought children by another man.   

{23:24} She shall be brought out into the congregation, andinquisition shall be made of her children.   

{23:25} Her children shall not take root, and her branches shallbring forth no fruit.   

{23:26} She shall leave her memory to be cursed, and her reproachshall not be blotted out.   

{23:27} And they that remain shall know that there is nothing betterthan the fear of the Lord, and that there is nothing sweeter than totake heed unto the commandments of the Lord.   

{23:28} It is great glory to follow the Lord, and to be received ofhim is long life.   

{24:1} Wisdom shall praise herself, and shall glory in the midst ofher people.   

{24:2} In the congregation of the most High shall she open hermouth, and triumph before his power.   

{24:3} I came out of the mouth of the most High, and covered theearth as a cloud.   

{24:4} I dwelt in high places, and my throne is in a cloudy pillar.   

{24:5} I alone compassed the circuit of heaven, and walked in thebottom of the deep.   

{24:6} In the waves of the sea and in all the earth, and in everypeople and nation, I got a possession.   

{24:7} With all these I sought rest: and in whose inheritance shallI abide?   

{24:8} So the Creator of all things gave me a commandment, and hethat made me caused my tabernacle to rest, and said, Let thy dwellingbe in Jacob, and thine inheritance in Israel.   

{24:9} He created me from the beginning before the world, and Ishall never fail.   

{24:10} In the holy tabernacle I served before him; and so was Iestablished in Sion.   

{24:11} Likewise in the beloved city he gave me rest, and inJerusalem was my power.   

{24:12} And I took root in an honourable people, even in the portionof the Lord's inheritance.   

{24:13} I was exalted like a cedar in Libanus, and as a cypress treeupon the mountains of Hermon.   

{24:14} I was exalted like a palm tree in En-gaddi, and as a roseplant in Jericho, as a fair olive tree in a pleasant field, and grew upas a plane tree by the water.   

{24:15} I gave a sweet smell like cinnamon and aspalathus, and Iyielded a pleasant odour like the best myrrh, as galbanum, and onyx,and sweet storax, and as the fume of frankincense in the tabernacle.   

{24:16} As the turpentine tree I stretched out my branches, and mybranches are the branches of honour and grace.   

{24:17} As the vine brought I forth pleasant savour, and my flowersare the fruit of honour and riches.   

{24:18} I am the mother of fair love, and fear, and knowledge, andholy hope: I therefore, being eternal, am given to all my childrenwhich are named of him.   

{24:19} Come unto me, all ye that be desirous of me, and fillyourselves with my fruits.   

{24:20} For my memorial is sweeter than honey, and mine inheritancethan the honeycomb.   

{24:21} They that eat me shall yet be hungry, and they that drink meshall yet be thirsty.   

{24:22} He that obeyeth me shall never be confounded, and they thatwork by me shall not do amiss.   

{24:23} All these things are the book of the covenant of the mosthigh God, even the law which Moses commanded for an heritage unto thecongregations of Jacob.   

{24:24} Faint not to be strong in the Lord; that he may confirm you,cleave unto him: for the Lord Almighty is God alone, and beside himthere is no other Saviour.   

{24:25} He filleth all things with his wisdom, as Phison and asTigris in the time of the new fruits.   

{24:26} He maketh the understanding to abound like Euphrates, and asJordan in the time of the harvest.   

{24:27} He maketh the doctrine of knowledge appear as the light, andas Geon in the time of vintage.   

{24:28} The first man knew her not perfectly: no more shall the lastfind her out.   

{24:29} For her thoughts are more than the sea, and her counselsprofounder than the great deep.   

{24:30} I also came out as a brook from a river, and as a conduitinto a garden.   

{24:31} I said, I will water my best garden, and will waterabundantly my garden bed: and, lo, my brook became a river, and myriver became a sea.   

{24:32} I will yet make doctrine to shine as the morning, and willsend forth her light afar off.   

{24:33} I will yet pour out doctrine as prophecy, and leave it toall ages for ever.   

{24:34} Behold that I have not laboured for myself only, but for allthem that seek wisdom.   

{25:1} In three things I was beautified, and stood up beautiful bothbefore God and men: the unity of brethren, the love of neighbours, aman and a wife that agree together.   

{25:2} Three sorts of men my soul hateth, and I am greatly offendedat their life: a poor man that is proud, a rich man that is a liar, andan old adulterer that doateth.   

{25:3} If thou hast gathered nothing in thy youth, how canst thoufind any thing in thine age?   

{25:4} O how comely a thing is judgment for gray hairs, and forancient men to know counsel!   

{25:5} O how comely is the wisdom of old men, and understanding andcounsel to men of honour.   

{25:6} Much experience is the crown of old men, and the fear of Godis their glory.   

{25:7} There be nine things which I have judged in mine heart to behappy, and the tenth I will utter with my tongue: A man that hath joyof his children; and he that liveth to see the fall of his enemy:   

{25:8} Well is him that dwelleth with a wife of understanding, andthat hath not slipped with his tongue, and that hath not served a manmore unworthy than himself:   

{25:9} Well is him that hath found prudence, and he that speaketh inthe ears of them that will hear:   

{25:10} O how great is he that findeth wisdom! yet is there noneabove him that feareth the Lord.   

{25:11} But the love of the Lord passeth all things forillumination: he that holdeth it, whereto shall he be likened?   

{25:12} The fear of the Lord is the beginning of his love: and faithis the beginning of cleaving unto him.   

{25:13} [Give me] any plague, but the plague of the heart: and anywickedness, but the wickedness of a woman:   

{25:14} And any affliction, but the affliction from them that hateme: and any revenge, but the revenge of enemies.   

{25:15} There is no head above the head of a serpent; and there isno wrath above the wrath of an enemy.   

{25:16} I had rather dwell with a lion and a dragon, than to keephouse with a wicked woman.   

{25:17} The wickedness of a woman changeth her face, and darkenethher countenance like sackcloth.   

{25:18} Her husband shall sit among his neighbours; and when heheareth it shall sigh bitterly.   

{25:19} All wickedness is but little to the wickedness of a woman:let the portion of a sinner fall upon her.   

{25:20} As the climbing up a sandy way is to the feet of the aged,so is a wife full of words to a quiet man.   

{25:21} Stumble not at the beauty of a woman, and desire her not forpleasure.   

{25:22} A woman, if she maintain her husband, is full of anger,impudence, and much reproach.   

{25:23} A wicked woman abateth the courage, maketh an heavycountenance and a wounded heart: a woman that will not comfort herhusband in distress maketh weak hands and feeble knees.   

{25:24} Of the woman came the beginning of sin, and through her weall die.   

{25:25} Give the water no passage; neither a wicked woman liberty togad abroad.   

{25:26} If she go not as thou wouldest have her, cut her off fromthy flesh, and give her a bill of divorce, and let her go.   

{26:1} Blessed is the man that hath a virtuous wife, for the numberof his days shall be double.   

{26:2} A virtuous woman rejoiceth her husband, and he shall fulfilthe years of his life in peace.   

{26:3} A good wife is a good portion, which shall be given in theportion of them that fear the Lord.   

{26:4} Whether a man be rich or poor, if he have a good heart towardthe Lord, he shall at all times rejoice with a cheerful countenance.   

{26:5} There be three things that mine heart feareth; and for thefourth I was sore afraid: the slander of a city, the gathering togetherof an unruly multitude, and a false accusation: all these are worsethan death.   

{26:6} But a grief of heart and sorrow is a woman that is jealousover another woman, and a scourge of the tongue which communicatethwith all.   

{26:7} An evil wife is a yoke shaken to and fro: he that hath holdof her is as though he held a scorpion.   

{26:8} A drunken woman and a gadder abroad causeth great anger, andshe will not cover her own shame.   

{26:9} The whoredom of a woman may be known in her haughty looks andeyelids.   

{26:10} If thy daughter be shameless, keep her in straitly, lest sheabuse herself through overmuch liberty.   

{26:11} Watch over an impudent eye: and marvel not if she trespassagainst thee.   

{26:12} She will open her mouth, as a thirsty traveller when he hathfound a fountain, and drink of every water near her: by every hedgewill she sit down, and open her quiver against every arrow.   

{26:13} The grace of a wife delighteth her husband, and herdiscretion will fatten his bones.   

{26:14} A silent and loving woman is a gift of the Lord; and thereis nothing so much worth as a mind well instructed.   

{26:15} A shamefaced and faithful woman is a double grace, and hercontinent mind cannot be valued.   

{26:16} As the sun when it ariseth in the high heaven; so is thebeauty of a good wife in the ordering of her house.   

{26:17} As the clear light is upon the holy candlestick; so is thebeauty of the face in ripe age.   

{26:18} As the golden pillars are upon the sockets of silver; so arethe fair feet with a constant heart.   

{26:19} My son, keep the flower of thine age sound; and give not thystrength to strangers.   

{26:20} When thou hast gotten a fruitful possession through all thefield, sow it with thine own seed, trusting in the goodness of thystock.   

{26:21} So thy race which thou leavest shall be magnified, havingthe confidence of their good descent.   

{26:22} An harlot shall be accounted as spittle; but a married womanis a tower against death to her husband.   

{26:23} A wicked woman is given as a portion to a wicked man: but agodly woman is given to him that feareth the Lord.   

{26:24} A dishonest woman contemneth shame: but an honest woman willreverence her husband.   

{26:25} A shameless woman shall be counted as a dog; but she that isshamefaced will fear the Lord.   

{26:26} A woman that honoureth her husband shall be judged wise ofall; but she that dishonoureth him in her pride shall be countedungodly of all.   

{26:27} A loud crying woman and a scold shall be sought out to driveaway the enemies.   

{26:28} There be two things that grieve my heart; and the thirdmaketh me angry: a man of war that suffereth poverty; and men ofunderstanding that are not set by; and one that returneth fromrighteousness to sin; the Lord prepareth such an one for the sword.   

{26:29} A merchant shall hardly keep himself from doing wrong; andan huckster shall not be freed from sin.   

{27:1} Many have sinned for a small matter; and he that seeketh forabundance will turn his eyes away.   

{27:2} As a nail sticketh fast between the joinings of the stones;so doth sin stick close between buying and selling.   

{27:3} Unless a man hold himself diligently in the fear of the Lord,his house shall soon be overthrown.   

{27:4} As when one sifteth with a sieve, the refuse remaineth; sothe filth of man in his talk.   

{27:5} The furnace proveth the potter's vessels; so the trial of manis in his reasoning.   

{27:6} The fruit declareth if the tree have been dressed; so is theutterance of a conceit in the heart of man.   

{27:7} Praise no man before thou hearest him speak; for this is thetrial of men.   

{27:8} If thou followest righteousness, thou shalt obtain her, andput her on, as a glorious long robe.   

{27:9} The birds will resort unto their like; so will truth returnunto them that practise in her.   

{27:10} As the lion lieth in wait for the prey; so sin for them thatwork iniquity.   

{27:11} The discourse of a godly man is always with wisdom; but afool changeth as the moon.   

{27:12} If thou be among the indiscreet, observe the time; but becontinually among men of understanding.   

{27:13} The discourse of fools is irksome, and their sport is thewantonness of sin.   

{27:14} The talk of him that sweareth much maketh the hair standupright; and their brawls make one stop his ears.   

{27:15} The strife of the proud is bloodshedding, and theirrevilings are grievous to the ear.   

{27:16} Whoso discovereth secrets loseth his credit; and shall neverfind friend to his mind.   

{27:17} Love thy friend, and be faithful unto him: but if thoubetrayest his secrets, follow no more after him.   

{27:18} For as a man hath destroyed his enemy; so hast thou lost thelove of thy neighbor.   

{27:19} As one that letteth a bird go out of his hand, so hast thoulet thy neighbour go, and shalt not get him again   

{27:20} Follow after him no more, for he is too far off; he is as aroe escaped out of the snare.   

{27:21} As for a wound, it may be bound up; and after reviling theremay be reconcilement: but he that betrayeth secrets is without hope.   

{27:22} He that winketh with the eyes worketh evil: and he thatknoweth him will depart from him.   

{27:23} When thou art present, he will speak sweetly, and willadmire thy words: but at the last he will writhe his mouth, and slanderthy sayings.   

{27:24} I have hated many things, but nothing like him; for the Lordwill hate him.   

{27:25} Whoso casteth a stone on high casteth it on his own head;and a deceitful stroke shall make wounds.   

{27:26} Whoso diggeth a pit shall fall therein: and he that settetha trap shall be taken therein.   

{27:27} He that worketh mischief, it shall fall upon him, and heshall not know whence it cometh.   

{27:28} Mockery and reproach are from the proud; but vengeance, as alion, shall lie in wait for them.   

{27:29} They that rejoice at the fall of the righteous shall betaken in the snare; and anguish shall consume them before they die.   

{27:30} Malice and wrath, even these are abominations; and thesinful man shall have them both.   

{28:1} He that revengeth shall find vengeance from the Lord, and hewill surely keep his sins [in remembrance.]   

{28:2} Forgive thy neighbour the hurt that he hath done unto thee,so shall thy sins also be forgiven when thou prayest.   

{28:3} One man beareth hatred against another, and doth he seekpardon from the Lord?   

{28:4} He sheweth no mercy to a man, which is like himself: and dothhe ask forgiveness of his own sins?   

{28:5} If he that is but flesh nourish hatred, who will intreat forpardon of his sins?   

{28:6} Remember thy end, and let enmity cease; [remember] corruptionand death, and abide in the commandments.   

{28:7} Remember the commandments, and bear no malice to thyneighbour: [remember] the covenant of the Highest, and wink atignorance.   

{28:8} Abstain from strife, and thou shalt diminish thy sins: for afurious man will kindle strife,   

{28:9} A sinful man disquieteth friends, and maketh debate amongthem that be at peace.   

{28:10} As the matter of the fire is, so it burneth: and as a man'sstrength is, so is his wrath; and according to his riches his angerriseth; and the stronger they are which contend, the more they will beinflamed.   

{28:11} An hasty contention kindleth a fire: and an hasty fightingsheddeth blood.   

{28:12} If thou blow the spark, it shall burn: if thou spit upon it,it shall be quenched: and both these come out of thy mouth.   

{28:13} Curse the whisperer and doubletongued: for such havedestroyed many that were at peace.   

{28:14} A backbiting tongue hath disquieted many, and driven themfrom nation to nation: strong cities hath it pulled down, andoverthrown the houses of great men.   

{28:15} A backbiting tongue hath cast out virtuous women, anddeprived them of their labours.   

{28:16} Whoso hearkeneth unto it shall never find rest, and neverdwell quietly.   

{28:17} The stroke of the whip maketh marks in the flesh: but thestroke of the tongue breaketh the bones.   

{28:18} Many have fallen by the edge of the sword: but not so manyas have fallen by the tongue.   

{28:19} Well is he that is defended through the venom thereof; whohath not drawn the yoke thereof, nor hath been bound in her bands.   

{28:20} For the yoke thereof is a yoke of iron, and the bandsthereof are bands of brass.   

{28:21} The death thereof is an evil death, the grave were betterthan it.   

{28:22} It shall not have rule over them that fear God, neithershall they be burned with the flame thereof.   

{28:23} Such as forsake the Lord shall fall into it; and it shallburn in them, and not be quenched; it shall be sent upon them as alion, and devour them as a leopard.   

{28:24} Look that thou hedge thy possession about with thorns, andbind up thy silver and gold,   

{28:25} And weigh thy words in a balance, and make a door and barfor thy mouth.   

{28:26} Beware thou slide not by it, lest thou fall before him thatlieth in wait.   

{29:1} He that is merciful will lend unto his neighbour; and he thatstrengtheneth his hand keepeth the commandments.   

{29:2} Lend to thy neighbour in time of his need, and pay thou thyneighbour again in due season.   

{29:3} Keep thy word, and deal faithfully with him, and thou shaltalways find the thing that is necessary for thee.   

{29:4} Many, when a thing was lent them, reckoned it to be found,and put them to trouble that helped them.   

{29:5} Till he hath received, he will kiss a man's hand; and for hisneighbour's money he will speak submissly: but when he should repay, hewill prolong the time, and return words of grief, and complain of thetime.   

{29:6} If he prevail, he shall hardly receive the half, and he willcount as if he had found it: if not, he hath deprived him of his money,and he hath gotten him an enemy without cause: he payeth him withcursings and railings; and for honour he will pay him disgrace.   

{29:7} Many therefore have refused to lend for other men's illdealing, fearing to be defrauded.   

{29:8} Yet have thou patience with a man in poor estate, and delaynot to shew him mercy.   

{29:9} Help the poor for the commandment's sake, and turn him notaway because of his poverty.   

{29:10} Lose thy money for thy brother and thy friend, and let itnot rust under a stone to be lost.   

{29:11} Lay up thy treasure according to the commandments of themost High, and it shall bring thee more profit than gold.   

{29:12} Shut up alms in thy storehouses: and it shall deliver theefrom all affliction.   

{29:13} It shall fight for thee against thine enemies better than amighty shield and strong spear.   

{29:14} An honest man is surety for his neighbour: but he that isimpudent will forsake him.   

{29:15} Forget not the friendship of thy surety, for he hath givenhis life for thee.   

{29:16} A sinner will overthrow the good estate of his surety:   

{29:17} And he that is of an unthankful mind will leave him [indanger] that delivered him.   

{29:18} Suretiship hath undone many of good estate, and shaken themas a wave of the sea: mighty men hath it driven from their houses, sothat they wandered among strange nations.   

{29:19} A wicked man transgressing the commandments of the Lordshall fall into suretiship: and he that undertaketh and followeth othermen's business for gain shall fall into suits.   

{29:20} Help thy neighbour according to thy power, and beware thatthou thyself fall not into the same.   

{29:21} The chief thing for life is water, and bread, and clothing,and an house to cover shame.   

{29:22} Better is the life of a poor man in a mean cottage, thandelicate fare in another man's house.   

{29:23} Be it little or much, hold thee contented, that thou hearnot the reproach of thy house.   

{29:24} For it is a miserable life to go from house to house: forwhere thou art a stranger, thou darest not open thy mouth.   

{29:25} Thou shalt entertain, and feast, and have no thanks:moreover thou shalt hear bitter words:   

{29:26} Come, thou stranger, and furnish a table, and feed me ofthat thou hast ready.   

{29:27} Give place, thou stranger, to an honourable man; my brothercometh to be lodged, and I have need of mine house.   

{29:28} These things are grievous to a man of understanding; theupbraiding of houseroom, and reproaching of the lender.   

{30:1} He that loveth his son causeth him oft to feel the rod, thathe may have joy of him in the end.   

{30:2} He that chastiseth his son shall have joy in him, and shallrejoice of him among his acquaintance.   

{30:3} He that teacheth his son grieveth the enemy: and before hisfriends he shall rejoice of him.   

{30:4} Though his father die, yet he is as though he were not dead:for he hath left one behind him that is like himself.   

{30:5} While he lived, he saw and rejoiced in him: and when he died,he was not sorrowful.   

{30:6} He left behind him an avenger against his enemies, and onethat shall requite kindness to his friends.   

{30:7} He that maketh too much of his son shall bind up his wounds;and his bowels will be troubled at every cry.   

{30:8} An horse not broken becometh headstrong: and a child left tohimself will be wilful.   

{30:9} Cocker thy child, and he shall make thee afraid: play withhim, and he will bring thee to heaviness.   

{30:10} Laugh not with him, lest thou have sorrow with him, and lestthou gnash thy teeth in the end.   

{30:11} Give him no liberty in his youth, and wink not at hisfollies.   

{30:12} Bow down his neck while he is young, and beat him on thesides while he is a child, lest he wax stubborn, and be disobedientunto thee, and so bring sorrow to thine heart.   

{30:13} Chastise thy son, and hold him to labour, lest his lewdbehaviour be an offence unto thee.   

{30:14} Better is the poor, being sound and strong of constitution,than a rich man that is afflicted in his body.   

{30:15} Health and good estate of body are above all gold, and astrong body above infinite wealth.   

{30:16} There is no riches above a sound body, and no joy above thejoy of the heart.   

{30:17} Death is better than a bitter life or continual sickness.   

{30:18} Delicates poured upon a mouth shut up are as messes of meatset upon a grave.   

{30:19} What good doeth the offering unto an idol? for neither canit eat nor smell: so is he that is persecuted of the Lord.   

{30:20} He seeth with his eyes and groaneth, as an eunuch thatembraceth a virgin and sigheth.   

{30:21} Give not over thy mind to heaviness, and afflict not thyselfin thine own counsel.   

{30:22} The gladness of the heart is the life of man, and thejoyfulness of a man prolongeth his days.   

{30:23} Love thine own soul, and comfort thy heart, remove sorrowfar from thee: for sorrow hath killed many, and there is no profittherein.   

{30:24} Envy and wrath shorten the life, and carefulness bringethage before the time.   

{30:25} A cheerful and good heart will have a care of his meat anddiet.   

{31:1} Watching for riches consumeth the flesh, and the care thereofdriveth away sleep.   

{31:2} Watching care will not let a man slumber, as a sore diseasebreaketh sleep,   

{31:3} The rich hath great labour in gathering riches together; andwhen he resteth, he is filled with his delicates.   

{31:4} The poor laboureth in his poor estate; and when he leavethoff, he is still needy.   

{31:5} He that loveth gold shall not be justified, and he thatfolloweth corruption shall have enough thereof.   

{31:6} Gold hath been the ruin of many, and their destruction waspresent.   

{31:7} It is a stumblingblock unto them that sacrifice unto it, andevery fool shall be taken therewith.   

{31:8} Blessed is the rich that is found without blemish, and hathnot gone after gold.   

{31:9} Who is he? and we will call him blessed: for wonderful thingshath he done among his people.   

{31:10} Who hath been tried thereby, and found perfect? then let himglory. Who might offend, and hath not offended? or done evil, and hathnot done it?   

{31:11} His goods shall be established, and the congregation shalldeclare his alms.   

{31:12} If thou sit at a bountiful table, be not greedy upon it, andsay not, There is much meat on it.   

{31:13} Remember that a wicked eye is an evil thing: and what iscreated more wicked than an eye? therefore it weepeth upon everyoccasion.   

{31:14} Stretch not thine hand whithersoever it looketh, and thrustit not with him into the dish.   

{31:15} Judge not thy neighbour by thyself: and be discreet in everypoint.   

{31:16} Eat as it becometh a man, those things which are set beforethee; and devour note, lest thou be hated.   

{31:17} Leave off first for manners' sake; and be not unsatiable,lest thou offend.   

{31:18} When thou sittest among many, reach not thine hand out firstof all.   

{31:19} A very little is sufficient for a man well nurtured, and hefetcheth not his wind short upon his bed.   

{31:20} Sound sleep cometh of moderate eating: he riseth early, andhis wits are with him: but the pain of watching, and choler, and pangsof the belly, are with an unsatiable man.   

{31:21} And if thou hast been forced to eat, arise, go forth, vomit,and thou shalt have rest.   

{31:22} My son, hear me, and despise me not, and at the last thoushalt find as I told thee: in all thy works be quick, so shall there nosickness come unto thee.   

{31:23} Whoso is liberal of his meat, men shall speak well of him;and the report of his good housekeeping will be believed.   

{31:24} But against him that is a niggard of his meat the whole cityshall murmur; and the testimonies of his niggardness shall not bedoubted of.   

{31:25} Shew not thy valiantness in wine; for wine hath destroyedmany.   

{31:26} The furnace proveth the edge by dipping: so doth wine thehearts of the proud by drunkeness.   

{31:27} Wine is as good as life to a man, if it be drunk moderately:what life is then to a man that is without wine? for it was made tomake men glad.   

{31:28} Wine measurably drunk and in season bringeth gladness of theheart, and cheerfulness of the mind:   

{31:29} But wine drunken with excess maketh bitterness of the mind,with brawling and quarrelling.   

{31:30} Drunkenness increaseth the rage of a fool till he offend: itdiminisheth strength, and maketh wounds.   

{31:31} Rebuke not thy neighbour at the wine, and despise him not inhis mirth: give him no despiteful words, and press not upon him withurging him [to drink.]   

{32:1} If thou be made the master [of a feast,] lift not thyself up,but be among them as one of the rest; take diligent care for them, andso sit down.   

{32:2} And when thou hast done all thy office, take thy place, thatthou mayest be merry with them, and receive a crown for thy wellordering of the feast.   

{32:3} Speak, thou that art the elder, for it becometh thee, butwith sound judgment; and hinder not musick.   

{32:4} Pour not out words where there is a musician, and shew notforth wisdom out of time.   

{32:5} A concert of musick in a banquet of wine is as a signet ofcarbuncle set in gold.   

{32:6} As a signet of an emerald set in a work of gold, so is themelody of musick with pleasant wine.   

{32:7} Speak, young man, if there be need of thee: and yet scarcelywhen thou art twice asked.   

{32:8} Let thy speech be short, comprehending much in few words; beas one that knoweth and yet holdeth his tongue.   

{32:9} If thou be among great men, make not thyself equal with them;and when ancient men are in place, use not many words.   

{32:10} Before the thunder goeth lightning; and before a shamefacedman shall go favour.   

{32:11} Rise up betimes, and be not the last; but get thee homewithout delay.   

{32:12} There take thy pastime, and do what thou wilt: but sin notby proud speech.   

{32:13} And for these things bless him that made thee, and hathreplenished thee with his good things.   

{32:14} Whoso feareth the Lord will receive his discipline; and theythat seek him early shall find favour.   

{32:15} He that seeketh the law shall be filled therewith: but thehypocrite will be offended thereat.   

{32:16} They that fear the Lord shall find judgment, and shallkindle justice as a light.   

{32:17} A sinful man will not be reproved, but findeth an excuseaccording to his will.   

{32:18} A man of counsel will be considerate; but a strange andproud man is not daunted with fear, even when of himself he hath donewithout counsel.   

{32:19} Do nothing without advice; and when thou hast once done,repent not.   

{32:20} Go not in a way wherein thou mayest fall, and stumble notamong the stones.   

{32:21} Be not confident in a plain way.   

{32:22} And beware of thine own children.   

{32:23} In every good work trust thy own soul; for this is thekeeping of the commandments.   

{32:24} He that believeth in the Lord taketh heed to thecommandment; and he that trusteth in him shall fare never the worse.   

{33:1} There shall no evil happen unto him that feareth the Lord;but in temptation even again he will deliver him.   

{33:2} A wise man hateth not the law; but he that is an hypocritetherein is as a ship in a storm.   

{33:3} A man of understanding trusteth in the law; and the law isfaithful unto him, as an oracle.   

{33:4} Prepare what to say, and so thou shalt be heard: and bind upinstruction, and then make answer.   

{33:5} The heart of the foolish is like a cartwheel; and histhoughts are like a rolling axletree.   

{33:6} A stallion horse is as a mocking friend, he neigheth underevery one that sitteth upon him.   

{33:7} Why doth one day excel another, when as all the light ofevery day in the year is of the sun?   

{33:8} By the knowledge of the Lord they were distinguished: and healtered seasons and feasts.   

{33:9} Some of them hath he made high days, and hallowed them, andsome of them hath he made ordinary days.   

{33:10} And all men are from the ground, and Adam was created ofearth:   

{33:11} In much knowledge the Lord hath divided them, and made theirways diverse.   

{33:12} Some of them hath he blessed and exalted and some of them hesanctified, and set near himself: but some of them hath he cursed andbrought low, and turned out of their places.   

{33:13} As the clay is in the potter's hand, to fashion it at hispleasure: so man is in the hand of him that made him, to render to themas liketh him best.   

{33:14} Good is set against evil, and life against death: so is thegodly against the sinner, and the sinner against the godly.   

{33:15} So look upon all the works of the most High; and there aretwo and two, one against another.   

{33:16} I awaked up last of all, as one that gathereth after thegrapegatherers: by the blessing of the Lord I profited, and tred mywinepress like a gatherer of grapes.   

{33:17} Consider that I laboured not for myself only, but for allthem that seek learning.   

{33:18} Hear me, O ye great men of the people, and hearken with yourears, ye rulers of the congregation.   

{33:19} Give not thy son and wife, thy brother and friend, powerover thee while thou livest, and give not thy goods to another: lest itrepent thee, and thou intreat for the same again.   

{33:20} As long as thou livest and hast breath in thee, give notthyself over to any.   

{33:21} For better it is that thy children should seek to thee, thanthat thou shouldest stand to their courtesy.   

{33:22} In all thy works keep to thyself the preeminence; leave nota stain in thine honour.   

{33:23} At the time when thou shalt end thy days, and finish thylife, distribute thine inheritance.   

{33:24} Fodder, a wand, and burdens, are for the ass; and bread,correction, and work, for a servant. .   

{33:25} If thou set thy servant to labour, thou shalt find rest: butif thou let him go idle, he shall seek liberty.   

{33:26} A yoke and a collar do bow the neck: so are tortures andtorments for an evil servant.   

{33:27} Send him to labour, that he be not idle; for idlenessteacheth much evil.   

{33:28} Set him to work, as is fit for him: if he be not obedient,put on more heavy fetters.   

{33:29} But be not excessive toward any; and without discretion donothing.   

{33:30} If thou have a servant, let him be unto thee as thyself,because thou hast bought him with a price.   

{33:31} If thou have a servant, entreat him as a brother: for thouhast need of him, as of thine own soul: if thou entreat him evil, andhe run from thee, which way wilt thou go to seek him?   

{34:1} The hopes of a man void of understanding are vain and false:and dreams lift up fools.   

{34:2} Whoso regardeth dreams is like him that catcheth at a shadow,and followeth after the wind.   

{34:3} The vision of dreams is the resemblance of one thing toanother, even as the likeness of a face to a face.   

{34:4} Of an unclean thing what can be cleansed? and from that thingwhich is false what truth can come?   

{34:5} Divinations, and soothsayings, and dreams, are vain: and theheart fancieth, as a woman's heart in travail.   

{34:6} If they be not sent from the most High in thy visitation, setnot thy heart upon them.   

{34:7} For dreams have deceived many, and they have failed that puttheir trust in them.   

{34:8} The law shall be found perfect without lies: and wisdom isperfection to a faithful mouth.   

{34:9} A man that hath travelled knoweth many things; and he thathath much experience will declare wisdom.   

{34:10} He that hath no experience knoweth little: but he that hathtravelled is full of prudence.   

{34:11} When I travelled, I saw many things; and I understand morethan I can express.   

{34:12} I was ofttimes in danger of death: yet I was deliveredbecause of these things.   

{34:13} The spirit of those that fear the Lord shall live; for theirhope is in him that saveth them.   

{34:14} Whoso feareth the Lord shall not fear nor be afraid; for heis his hope.   

{34:15} Blessed is the soul of him that feareth the Lord: to whomdoth he look? and who is his strength?   

{34:16} For the eyes of the Lord are upon them that love him, he istheir mighty protection and strong stay, a defence from heat, and acover from the sun at noon, a preservation from stumbling, and an helpfrom falling.   

{34:17} He raiseth up the soul, and lighteneth the eyes: he givethhealth, life, and blessing.   

{34:18} He that sacrificeth of a thing wrongfully gotten, hisoffering is ridiculous; and the gifts of unjust men are not accepted.   

{34:19} The most High is not pleased with the offerings of thewicked; neither is he pacified for sin by the multitude of sacrifices.   

{34:20} Whoso bringeth an offering of the goods of the poor doeth asone that killeth the son before his father's eyes.   

{34:21} The bread of the needy is their life: he that defraudeth himthereof is a man of blood.   

{34:22} He that taketh away his neighbour's living slayeth him; andhe that defraudeth the labourer of his hire is a bloodshedder.   

{34:23} When one buildeth, and another pulleth down, what profithave they then but labour?   

{34:24} When one prayeth, and another curseth, whose voice will theLord hear?   

{34:25} He that washeth himself after the touching of a dead body,if he touch it again, what availeth his washing?   

{34:26} So is it with a man that fasteth for his sins, and goethagain, and doeth the same: who will hear his prayer? or what doth hishumbling profit him?   

{35:1} He that keepeth the law bringeth offerings enough: he thattaketh heed to the commandment offereth a peace offering.   

{35:2} He that requiteth a goodturn offereth fine flour; and he thatgiveth alms sacrificeth praise.   

{35:3} To depart from wickedness is a thing pleasing to the Lord;and to forsake unrighteousness is a propitiation.   

{35:4} Thou shalt not appear empty before the Lord.   

{35:5} For all these things [are to be done] because of thecommandment.   

{35:6} The offering of the righteous maketh the altar fat, and thesweet savour thereof is before the most High.   

{35:7} The sacrifice of a just man is acceptable. and the memorialthereof shall never be forgotten.   

{35:8} Give the Lord his honour with a good eye, and diminish notthe firstfruits of thine hands.   

{35:9} In all thy gifts shew a cheerful countenance, and dedicatethy tithes with gladness.   

{35:10} Give unto the most High according as he hath enriched thee;and as thou hast gotten, give with a cheerful eye.   

{35:11} For the Lord recompenseth, and will give thee seven times asmuch.   

{35:12} Do not think to corrupt with gifts; for such he will notreceive: and trust not to unrighteous sacrifices; for the Lord isjudge, and with him is no respect of persons.   

{35:13} He will not accept any person against a poor man, but willhear the prayer of the oppressed.   

{35:14} He will not despise the supplication of the fatherless; northe widow, when she poureth out her complaint.   

{35:15} Do not the tears run down the widow's cheeks? and is not hercry against him that causeth them to fall?   

{35:16} He that serveth the Lord shall be accepted with favour, andhis prayer shall reach unto the clouds.   

{35:17} The prayer of the humble pierceth the clouds: and till itcome nigh, he will not be comforted; and will not depart, till the mostHigh shall behold to judge righteously, and execute judgment.   

{35:18} For the Lord will not be slack, neither will the Mighty bepatient toward them, till he have smitten in sunder the loins of theunmerciful, and repayed vengeance to the heathen; till he have takenaway the multitude of the proud, and broken the sceptre of theunrighteous;   

{35:19} Till he have rendered to every man according to his deeds,and to the works of men according to their devices; till he have judgedthe cause of his people, and made them to rejoice in his mercy.   

{35:20} Mercy is seasonable in the time of affliction, as clouds ofrain in the time of drought.   

{36:1} Have mercy upon us, O Lord God of all, and behold us:   

{36:2} And send thy fear upon all the nations that seek not afterthee.   

{36:3} Lift up thy hand against the strange nations, and let themsee thy power.   

{36:4} As thou wast sanctified in us before them: so be thoumagnified among them before us.   

{36:5} And let them know thee, as we have known thee, that there isno God but only thou, O God.   

{36:6} Shew new signs, and make other strange wonders: glorify thyhand and thy right arm, that they may set forth thy wondrous works.   

{36:7} Raise up indignation, and pour out wrath: take away theadversary, and destroy the enemy.   

{36:8} Sake the time short, remember the covenant, and let themdeclare thy wonderful works.   

{36:9} Let him that escapeth be consumed by the rage of the fire;and let them perish that oppress the people.   

{36:10} Smite in sunder the heads of the rulers of the heathen, thatsay, There is none other but we.   

{36:11} Gather all the tribes of Jacob together, and inherit thouthem, as from the beginning.   

{36:12} O Lord, have mercy upon the people that is called by thyname, and upon Israel, whom thou hast named thy firstborn.   

{36:13} O be merciful unto Jerusalem, thy holy city, the place ofthy rest.   

{36:14} Fill Sion with thine unspeakable oracles, and thy peoplewith thy glory:   

{36:15} Give testimony unto those that thou hast possessed from thebeginning, and raise up prophets that have been in thy name.   

{36:16} Reward them that wait for thee, and let thy prophets befound faithful.   

{36:17} O Lord, hear the prayer of thy servants, according to theblessing of Aaron over thy people, that all they which dwell upon theearth may know that thou art the Lord, the eternal God.   

{36:18} The belly devoureth all meats, yet is one meat better thananother.   

{36:19} As the palate tasteth divers kinds of venison: so doth anheart of understanding false speeches.   

{36:20} A froward heart causeth heaviness: but a man of experiencewill recompense him.   

{36:21} A woman will receive every man, yet is one daughter betterthan another.   

{36:22} The beauty of a woman cheereth the countenance, and a manloveth nothing better.   

{36:23} If there be kindness, meekness, and comfort, in her tongue,then is not her husband like other men.   

{36:24} He that getteth a wife beginneth a possession, a help likeunto himself, and a pillar of rest.   

{36:25} Where no hedge is, there the possession is spoiled: and hethat hath no wife will wander up and down mourning.   

{36:26} Who will trust a thief well appointed, that skippeth fromcity to city? so [who will believe] a man that hath no house, andlodgeth wheresoever the night taketh him?   

{37:1} Every friend saith, I am his friend also: but there is afriend, which is only a friend in name.   

{37:2} Is it not a grief unto death, when a companion and friend isturned to an enemy?   

{37:3} O wicked imagination, whence camest thou in to cover theearth with deceit?   

{37:4} There is a companion, which rejoiceth in the prosperity of afriend, but in the time of trouble will be against him.   

{37:5} There is a companion, which helpeth his friend for the belly,and taketh up the buckler against the enemy.   

{37:6} Forget not thy friend in thy mind, and be not unmindful ofhim in thy riches.   

{37:7} Every counsellor extolleth counsel; but there is some thatcounselleth for himself.   

{37:8} Beware of a counsellor, and know before what need he hath;for he will counsel for himself; lest he cast the lot upon thee,   

{37:9} And say unto thee, Thy way is good: and afterward he stand onthe other side, to see what shall befall thee.   

{37:10} Consult not with one that suspecteth thee: and hide thycounsel from such as envy thee.   

{37:11} Neither consult with a woman touching her of whom she isjealous; neither with a coward in matters of war; nor with a merchantconcerning exchange; nor with a buyer of selling; nor with an enviousman of thankfulness; nor with an unmerciful man touching kindness; norwith the slothful for any work; nor with an hireling for a year offinishing work; nor with an idle servant of much business: hearken notunto these in any matter of counsel.   

{37:12} But be continually with a godly man, whom thou knowest tokeep the commandments of the Lord, whose, mind is according to thymind, and will sorrow with thee, if thou shalt miscarry.   

{37:13} And let the counsel of thine own heart stand: for there isno man more faithful unto thee than it.   

{37:14} For a man's mind is sometime wont to tell him more thanseven watchmen, that sit above in an high tower.   

{37:15} And above all this pray to the most High, that he willdirect thy way in truth.   

{37:16} Let reason go before every enterprize, and counsel beforeevery action.   

{37:17} The countenance is a sign of changing of the heart.   

{37:18} Four manner of things appear: good and evil, life and death:but the tongue ruleth over them continually.   

{37:19} There is one that is wise and teacheth many, and yet isunprofitable to himself.   

{37:20} There is one that sheweth wisdom in words, and is hated: heshall be destitute of all food.   

{37:21} For grace is not given, him from the Lord, because he isdeprived of all wisdom.   

{37:22} Another is wise to himself; and the fruits of understandingare commendable in his mouth.   

{37:23} A wise man instructeth his people; and the fruits of hisunderstanding fail not.   

{37:24} A wise man shall be filled with blessing; and all they thatsee him shall count him happy.   

{37:25} The days of the life of man may be numbered: but the days ofIsrael are innumerable.   

{37:26} A wise man shall inherit glory among his people, and hisname shall be perpetual.   

{37:27} My son, prove thy soul in thy life, and see what is evil forit, and give not that unto it.   

{37:28} For all things are not profitable for all men, neither hathevery soul pleasure in every thing.   

{37:29} Be not unsatiable in any dainty thing, nor too greedy uponmeats:   

{37:30} For excess of meats bringeth sickness, and surfeiting willturn into choler.   

{37:31} By surfeiting have many perished; but he that taketh heedprolongeth his life.   

{38:1} Honour a physician with the honour due unto him for the useswhich ye may have of him: for the Lord hath created him.   

{38:2} For of the most High cometh healing, and he shall receivehonour of the king.   

{38:3} The skill of the physician shall lift up his head: and in thesight of great men he shall be in admiration.   

{38:4} The Lord hath created medicines out of the earth; and he thatis wise will not abhor them.   

{38:5} Was not the water made sweet with wood, that the virtuethereof might be known?   

{38:6} And he hath given men skill, that he might be honoured in hismarvellous works.   

{38:7} With such doth he heal [men,] and taketh away their pains.   

{38:8} Of such doth the apothecary make a confection; and of hisworks there is no end; and from him is peace over all the earth,   

{38:9} My son, in thy sickness be not negligent: but pray unto theLord, and he will make thee whole.   

{38:10} Leave off from sin, and order thine hands aright, andcleanse thy heart from all wickedness.   

{38:11} Give a sweet savour, and a memorial of fine flour; and makea fat offering, as not being.   

{38:12} Then give place to the physician, for the Lord hath createdhim: let him not go from thee, for thou hast need of him.   

{38:13} There is a time when in their hands there is good success.   

{38:14} For they shall also pray unto the Lord, that he wouldprosper that, which they give for ease and remedy to prolong life.   

{38:15} He that sinneth before his Maker, let him fall into the handof the physician.   

{38:16} My son, let tears fall down over the dead, and begin tolament, as if thou hadst suffered great harm thyself; and then coverhis body according to the custom, and neglect not his burial.   

{38:17} Weep bitterly, and make great moan, and use lamentation, ashe is worthy, and that a day or two, lest thou be evil spoken of: andthen comfort thyself for thy heaviness.   

{38:18} For of heaviness cometh death, and the heaviness of theheart breaketh strength.   

{38:19} In affliction also sorrow remaineth: and the life of thepoor is the curse of the heart.   

{38:20} Take no heaviness to heart: drive it away, and member thelast end.   

{38:21} Forget it not, for there is no turning again: thou shalt notdo him good, but hurt thyself.   

{38:22} Remember my judgment: for thine also shall be so; yesterdayfor me, and to day for thee.   

{38:23} When the dead is at rest, let his remembrance rest; and becomforted for him, when his Spirit is departed from him.   

{38:24} The wisdom of a learned man cometh by opportunity ofleisure: and he that hath little business shall become wise.   

{38:25} How can he get wisdom that holdeth the plough, and thatglorieth in the goad, that driveth oxen, and is occupied in theirlabours, and whose talk is of bullocks?   

{38:26} He giveth his mind to make furrows; and is diligent to givethe kine fodder.   

{38:27} So every carpenter and workmaster, that laboureth night andday: and they that cut and grave seals, and are diligent to make greatvariety, and give themselves to counterfeit imagery, and watch tofinish a work:   

{38:28} The smith also sitting by the anvil, and considering theiron work, the vapour of the fire wasteth his flesh, and he fightethwith the heat of the furnace: the noise of the hammer and the anvil isever in his ears, and his eyes look still upon the pattern of the thingthat he maketh; he setteth his mind to finish his work, and watcheth topolish it perfectly:   

{38:29} So doth the potter sitting at his work, and turning thewheel about with his feet, who is alway carefully set at his work, andmaketh all his work by number;   

{38:30} He fashioneth the clay with his arm, and boweth down hisstrength before his feet; he applieth himself to lead it over; and heis diligent to make clean the furnace:   

{38:31} All these trust to their hands: and every one is wise in hiswork.   

{38:32} Without these cannot a city be inhabited: and they shall notdwell where they will, nor go up and down:   

{38:33} They shall not be sought for in publick counsel, nor sithigh in the congregation: they shall not sit on the judges' seat, norunderstand the sentence of judgment: they cannot declare justice andjudgment; and they shall not be found where parables are spoken.   

{38:34} But they will maintain the state of the world, and [all]their desire is in the work of their craft.   

{39:1} But he that giveth his mind to the law of the most High, andis occupied in the meditation thereof, will seek out the wisdom of allthe ancient, and be occupied in prophecies.   

{39:2} He will keep the sayings of the renowned men: and wheresubtil parables are, he will be there also.   

{39:3} He will seek out the secrets of grave sentences, and beconversant in dark parables.   

{39:4} He shall serve among great men, and appear before princes: hewill travel through strange countries; for he hath tried the good andthe evil among men.   

{39:5} He will give his heart to resort early to the Lord that madehim, and will pray before the most High, and will open his mouth inprayer, and make supplication for his sins.   

{39:6} When the great Lord will, he shall be filled with the spiritof understanding: he shall pour out wise sentences, and give thanksunto the Lord in his prayer.   

{39:7} He shall direct his counsel and knowledge, and in his secretsshall he meditate.   

{39:8} He shall shew forth that which he hath learned, and shallglory in the law of the covenant of the Lord.   

{39:9} Many shall commend his understanding; and so long as theworld endureth, it shall not be blotted out; his memorial shall notdepart away, and his name shall live from generation to generation.   

{39:10} Nations shall shew forth his wisdom, and the congregationshall declare his praise.   

{39:11} If he die, he shall leave a greater name than a thousand:and if he live, he shall increase it.   

{39:12} Yet have I more to say, which I have thought upon; for I amfilled as the moon at the full.   

{39:13} Hearken unto me, ye holy children, and bud forth as a rosegrowing by the brook of the field:   

{39:14} And give ye a sweet savour as frankincense, and flourish asa lily, send forth a smell, and sing a song of praise, bless the Lordin all his works.   

{39:15} Magnify his name, and shew forth his praise with the songsof your lips, and with harps, and in praising him ye shall say afterthis manner:   

{39:16} All the works of the Lord are exceeding good, and whatsoeverhe commandeth shall be accomplished in due season.   

{39:17} And none may say, What is this? wherefore is that? for attime convenient they shall all be sought out: at his commandment thewaters stood as an heap, and at the words of his mouth the receptaclesof waters.   

{39:18} At his commandment is done whatsoever pleaseth him; and nonecan hinder, when he will save.   

{39:19} The works of all flesh are before him, and nothing can behid from his eyes.   

{39:20} He seeth from everlasting to everlasting; and there isnothing wonderful before him.   

{39:21} A man need not to say, What is this? wherefore is that? forhe hath made all things for their uses.   

{39:22} His blessing covered the dry land as a river, and watered itas a flood.   

{39:23} As he hath turned the waters into saltness: so shall theheathen inherit his wrath.   

{39:24} As his ways are plain unto the holy; so are theystumblingblocks unto the wicked.   

{39:25} For the good are good things created from the beginning: soevil things for sinners.   

{39:26} The principal things for the whole use of man's life arewater, fire, iron, and salt, flour of wheat, honey, milk, and the bloodof the grape, and oil, and clothing.   

{39:27} All these things are for good to the godly: so to thesinners they are turned into evil.   

{39:28} There be spirits that are created for vengeance, which intheir fury lay on sore strokes; in the time of destruction they pourout their force, and appease the wrath of him that made them.   

{39:29} Fire, and hail, and famine, and death, all these werecreated for vengeance;   

{39:30} Teeth of wild beasts, and scorpions, serpents, and the swordpunishing the wicked to destruction.   

{39:31} They shall rejoice in his commandment, and they shall beready upon earth, when need is; and when their time is come, they shallnot transgress his word.   

{39:32} Therefore from the beginning I was resolved, and thoughtupon these things, and have left them in writing.   

{39:33} All the works of the Lord are good: and he will give everyneedful thing in due season.   

{39:34} So that a man cannot say, This is worse than that: for intime they shall all be well approved.   

{39:35} And therefore praise ye the Lord with the whole heart andmouth, and bless the name of the Lord.   

{40:1} Great travail is created for every man, and an heavy yoke isupon the sons of Adam, from the day that they go out of their mother'swomb, till the day that they return to the mother of all things.   

{40:2} Their imagination of things to come, and the day of death,[trouble] their thoughts, and [cause] fear of heart;   

{40:3} From him that sitteth on a throne of glory, unto him that ishumbled in earth and ashes;   

{40:4} From him that weareth purple and a crown, unto him that isclothed with a linen frock.   

{40:5} Wrath, and envy, trouble, and unquietness, fear of death, andanger, and strife, and in the time of rest upon his bed his nightsleep, do change his knowledge.   

{40:6} A little or nothing is his rest, and afterward he is in hissleep, as in a day of keeping watch, troubled in the vision of hisheart, as if he were escaped out of a battle.   

{40:7} When all is safe, he awaketh, and marvelleth that the fearwas nothing.   

{40:8} [Such things happen] unto all flesh, both man and beast, andthat is sevenfold more upon sinners.   

{40:9} Death, and bloodshed, strife, and sword, calamities, famine,tribulation, and the scourge;   

{40:10} These things are created for the wicked, and for their sakescame the flood.   

{40:11} All things that are of the earth shall turn to the earthagain: and that which is of the waters doth return into the sea.   

{40:12} All bribery and injustice shall be blotted out: but truedealing shall endure for ever.   

{40:13} The goods of the unjust shall be dried up like a river, andshall vanish with noise, like a great thunder in rain.   

{40:14} While he openeth his hand he shall rejoice: so shalltransgressors come to nought.   

{40:15} The children of the ungodly shall not bring forth manybranches: but are as unclean roots upon a hard rock.   

{40:16} The weed growing upon every water and bank of a river shallbe pulled up before all grass.   

{40:17} Bountifulness is as a most fruitful garden, and mercifulnessendureth for ever.   

{40:18} To labour, and to be content with that a man hath, is asweet life: but he that findeth a treasure is above them both.   

{40:19} Children and the building of a city continue a man's name:but a blameless wife is counted above them both.   

{40:20} Wine and musick rejoice the heart: but the love of wisdom isabove them both.   

{40:21} The pipe and the psaltery make sweet melody: but a pleasanttongue is above them both.   

{40:22} Thine eye desireth favour and beauty: but more than bothcorn while it is green.   

{40:23} A friend and companion never meet amiss: but above both is awife with her husband.   

{40:24} Brethren and help are against time of trouble: but almsshall deliver more than them both.   

{40:25} Gold and silver make the foot stand sure: but counsel isesteemed above them both.   

{40:26} Riches and strength lift up the heart: but the fear of theLord is above them both: there is no want in the fear of the Lord, andit needeth not to seek help.   

{40:27} The fear of the Lord is a fruitful garden, and covereth himabove all glory.   

{40:28} My son, lead not a beggar's life; for better it is to diethan to beg.   

{40:29} The life of him that dependeth on another man's table is notto be counted for a life; for he polluteth himself with other men'smeat: but a wise man well nurtured will beware thereof.   

{40:30} Begging is sweet in the mouth of the shameless: but in hisbelly there shall burn a fire.   

{41:1} O death, how bitter is the remembrance of thee to a man thatliveth at rest in his possessions, unto the man that hath nothing tovex him, and that hath prosperity in all things: yea, unto him that isyet able to receive meat!   

{41:2} O death, acceptable is thy sentence unto the needy, and untohim whose strength faileth, that is now in the last age, and is vexedwith all things, and to him that despaireth, and hath lost patience!   

{41:3} Fear not the sentence of death, remember them that have beenbefore thee, and that come after; for this is the sentence of the Lordover all flesh.   

{41:4} And why art thou against the pleasure of the most High? thereis no inquisition in the grave, whether thou have lived ten, or anhundred, or a thousand years.   

{41:5} The children of sinners are abominable children, and theythat are conversant in the dwelling of the ungodly.   

{41:6} The inheritance of sinners' children shall perish, and theirposterity shall have a perpetual reproach.   

{41:7} The children will complain of an ungodly father, because theyshall be reproached for his sake.   

{41:8} Woe be unto you, ungodly men, which have forsaken the law ofthe most high God! for if ye increase, it shall be to your destruction:   

{41:9} And if ye be born, ye shall be born to a curse: and if yedie, a curse shall be your portion.   

{41:10} All that are of the earth shall turn to earth again: so theungodly shall go from a curse to destruction.   

{41:11} The mourning of men is about their bodies: but an ill nameof sinners shall be blotted out.   

{41:12} Have regard to thy name; for that shall continue with theeabove a thousand great treasures of gold.   

{41:13} A good life hath but few days: but a good name endureth forever.   

{41:14} My children, keep discipline in peace: for wisdom that ishid, and a treasure that is not seen, what profit is in them both?   

{41:15} A man that hideth his foolishness is better than a man thathideth his wisdom.   

{41:16} Therefore be shamefaced according to my word: for it is notgood to retain all shamefacedness; neither is it altogether approved inevery thing.   

{41:17} Be ashamed of whoredom before father and mother: and of alie before a prince and a mighty man;   

{41:18} Of an offence before a judge and ruler; of iniquity before acongregation and people; of unjust dealing before thy partner andfriend;   

{41:19} And of theft in regard of the place where thou sojournest,and in regard of the truth of God and his covenant; and to lean withthine elbow upon the meat; and of scorning to give and take;   

{41:20} And of silence before them that salute thee; and to lookupon an harlot;   

{41:21} And to turn away thy face from thy kinsman; or to take awaya portion or a gift; or to gaze upon another man's wife.   

{41:22} Or to be overbusy with his maid, and come not near her bed;or of upbraiding speeches before friends; and after thou hast given,upbraid not;   

{41:23} Or of iterating and speaking again that which thou hastheard; and of revealing of secrets.   

{41:24} So shalt thou be truly shamefaced and find favour before allmen.   

{42:1} Of these things be not thou ashamed, and accept no person tosin thereby:   

{42:2} Of the law of the most High, and his covenant; and ofjudgment to justify the ungodly;   

{42:3} Of reckoning with thy partners and travellers; or of the giftof the heritage of friends;   

{42:4} Of exactness of balance and weights; or of getting much orlittle;   

{42:5} And of merchants' indifferent selling; of much correction ofchildren; and to make the side of an evil servant to bleed.   

{42:6} Sure keeping is good, where an evil wife is; and shut up,where many hands are.   

{42:7} Deliver all things in number and weight; and put all inwriting that thou givest out, or receivest in.   

{42:8} Be not ashamed to inform the unwise and foolish, and theextreme aged that contendeth with those that are young: thus shalt thoube truly learned, and approved of all men living.   

{42:9} The father waketh for the daughter, when no man knoweth; andthe care for her taketh away sleep: when she is young, lest she passaway the flower of her age; and being married, lest she should be hated:   

{42:10} In her virginity, lest she should be defiled and gotten withchild in her father's house; and having an husband, lest she shouldmisbehave herself; and when she is married, lest she should be barren.   

{42:11} Keep a sure watch over a shameless daughter, lest she makethee a laughingstock to thine enemies, and a byword in the city, and areproach among the people, and make thee ashamed before the multitude.   

{42:12} Behold not every body's beauty, and sit not in the midst ofwomen.   

{42:13} For from garments cometh a moth, and from women wickedness.   

{42:14} Better is the churlishness of a man than a courteous woman,a woman, I say, which bringeth shame and reproach.   

{42:15} I will now remember the works of the Lord, and declare thethings that I have seen: In the words of the Lord are his works.   

{42:16} The sun that giveth light looketh upon all things, and thework thereof is full of the glory of the Lord.   

{42:17} The Lord hath not given power to the saints to declare allhis marvellous works, which the Almighty Lord firmly settled, thatwhatsoever is might be established for his glory.   

{42:18} He seeketh out the deep, and the heart, and considereththeir crafty devices: for the Lord knoweth all that may be known, andhe beholdeth the signs of the world.   

{42:19} He declareth the things that are past, and for to come, andrevealeth the steps of hidden things.   

{42:20} No thought escapeth him, neither any word is hidden from him.   

{42:21} He hath garnished the excellent works of his wisdom, and heis from everlasting to everlasting: unto him may nothing be added,neither can he be diminished, and he hath no need of any counsellor.   

{42:22} Oh how desirable are all his works! and that a man may seeeven to a spark.   

{42:23} All these things live and remain for ever for all uses, andthey are all obedient.   

{42:24} All things are double one against another: and he hath madenothing imperfect.   

{42:25} One thing establisheth the good or another: and who shall befilled with beholding his glory?   

{43:1} The pride of the height, the clear firmament, the beauty ofheaven, with his glorious shew;   

{43:2} The sun when it appeareth, declaring at his rising amarvellous instrument, the work of the most High:   

{43:3} At noon it parcheth the country, and who can abide theburning heat thereof?   

{43:4} A man blowing a furnace is in works of heat, but the sunburneth the mountains three times more; breathing out fiery vapours,and sending forth bright beams, it dimmeth the eyes.   

{43:5} Great is the Lord that made it; and at his commandmentrunneth hastily.   

{43:6} He made the moon also to serve in her season for adeclaration of times, and a sign of the world.   

{43:7} From the moon is the sign of feasts, a light that decreasethin her perfection.   

{43:8} The month is called after her name, increasing wonderfully inher changing, being an instrument of the armies above, shining in thefirmament of heaven;   

{43:9} The beauty of heaven, the glory of the stars, an ornamentgiving light in the highest places of the Lord.   

{43:10} At the commandment of the Holy One they will stand in theirorder, and never faint in their watches.   

{43:11} Look upon the rainbow, and praise him that made it; verybeautiful it is in the brightness thereof.   

{43:12} It compasseth the heaven about with a glorious circle, andthe hands of the most High have bended it.   

{43:13} By his commandment he maketh the snow to fall aplace, andsendeth swiftly the lightnings of his judgment.   

{43:14} Through this the treasures are opened: and clouds fly forthas fowls.   

{43:15} By his great power he maketh the clouds firm, and thehailstones are broken small.   

{43:16} At his sight the mountains are shaken, and at his will thesouth wind bloweth.   

{43:17} The noise of the thunder maketh the earth to tremble: sodoth the northern storm and the whirlwind: as birds flying hescattereth the snow, and the falling down thereof is as the lighting ofgrasshoppers:   

{43:18} The eye marvelleth at the beauty of the whiteness thereof,and the heart is astonished at the raining of it.   

{43:19} The hoarfrost also as salt he poureth on the earth, andbeing congealed, it lieth on the top of sharp stakes.   

{43:20} When the cold north wind bloweth, and the water is congealedinto ice, it abideth upon every gathering together of water, andclotheth the water as with a breastplate.   

{43:21} It devoureth the mountains, and burneth the wilderness, andconsumeth the grass as fire.   

{43:22} A present remedy of all is a mist coming speedily, a dewcoming after heat refresheth.   

{43:23} By his counsel he appeaseth the deep, and planteth islandstherein.   

{43:24} They that sail on the sea tell of the danger thereof; andwhen we hear it with our ears, we marvel thereat.   

{43:25} For therein be strange and wondrous works, variety of allkinds of beasts and whales created.   

{43:26} By him the end of them hath prosperous success, and by hisword all things consist.   

{43:27} We may speak much, and yet come short: wherefore in sum, heis all.   

{43:28} How shall we be able to magnify him? for he is great aboveall his works.   

{43:29} The Lord is terrible and very great, and marvellous is hispower.   

{43:30} When ye glorify the Lord, exalt him as much as ye can; foreven yet will he far exceed: and when ye exalt him, put forth all yourstrength, and be not weary; for ye can never go far enough.   

{43:31} Who hath seen him, that he might tell us? and who canmagnify him as he is?   

{43:32} There are yet hid greater things than these be, for we haveseen but a few of his works.   

{43:33} For the Lord hath made all things; and to the godly hath hegiven wisdom.   

{44:1} Let us now praise famous men, and our fathers that begat us.   

{44:2} The Lord hath wrought great glory by them through his greatpower from the beginning.   

{44:3} Such as did bear rule in their kingdoms, men renowned fortheir power, giving counsel by their understanding, and declaringprophecies:   

{44:4} Leaders of the people by their counsels, and by theirknowledge of learning meet for the people, wise and eloquent are theirinstructions:   

{44:5} Such as found out musical tunes, and recited verses inwriting:   

{44:6} Rich men furnished with ability, living peaceably in theirhabitations:   

{44:7} All these were honoured in their generations, and were theglory of their times.   

{44:8} There be of them, that have left a name behind them, thattheir praises might be reported.   

{44:9} And some there be, which have no memorial; who are perished,as though they had never been; and are become as though they had neverbeen born; and their children after them.   

{44:10} But these were merciful men, whose righteousness hath notbeen forgotten.   

{44:11} With their seed shall continually remain a good inheritance,and their children are within the covenant.   

{44:12} Their seed standeth fast, and their children for their sakes.   

{44:13} Their seed shall remain for ever, and their glory shall notbe blotted out.   

{44:14} Their bodies are buried in peace; but their name liveth forevermore.   

{44:15} The people will tell of their wisdom, and the congregationwill shew forth their praise.   

{44:16} Enoch pleased the Lord, and was translated, being an exampleof repentance to all generations.   

{44:17} Noah was found perfect and righteous; in the time of wrathhe was taken in exchange [for the world;] therefore was he left as aremnant unto the earth, when the flood came.   

{44:18} An everlasting covenant was made with him, that all fleshshould perish no more by the flood.   

{44:19} Abraham was a great father of many people: in glory wasthere none like unto him;   

{44:20} Who kept the law of the most High, and was in covenant withhim: he established the covenant in his flesh; and when he was proved,he was found faithful.   

{44:21} Therefore he assured him by an oath, that he would bless thenations in his seed, and that he would multiply him as the dust of theearth, and exalt his seed as the stars, and cause them to inherit fromsea to sea, and from the river unto the utmost part of the land.   

{44:22} With Isaac did he establish likewise [for Abraham hisfather's sake] the blessing of all men, and the covenant, And made itrest upon the head of Jacob. He acknowledged him in his blessing, andgave him an heritage, and divided his portions; among the twelve tribesdid he part them.   

{45:1} And he brought out of him a merciful man, which found favourin the sight of all flesh, even Moses, beloved of God and men, whosememorial is blessed.   

{45:2} He made him like to the glorious saints, and magnified him,so that his enemies stood in fear of him.   

{45:3} By his words he caused the wonders to cease, and he made himglorious in the sight of kings, and gave him a commandment for hispeople, and shewed him part of his glory.   

{45:4} He sanctified him in his faithfuless and meekness, and chosehim out of all men.   

{45:5} He made him to hear his voice, and brought him into the darkcloud, and gave him commandments before his face, even the law of lifeand knowledge, that he might teach Jacob his covenants, and Israel hisjudgments.   

{45:6} He exalted Aaron, an holy man like unto him, even hisbrother, of the tribe of Levi.   

{45:7} An everlasting covenant he made with him and gave him thepriesthood among the people; he beautified him with comely ornaments,and clothed him with a robe of glory.   

{45:8} He put upon him perfect glory; and strengthened him with richgarments, with breeches, with a long robe, and the ephod.   

{45:9} And he compassed him with pomegranates, and with many goldenbells round about, that as he went there might be a sound, and a noisemade that might be heard in the temple, for a memorial to the childrenof his people;   

{45:10} With an holy garment, with gold, and blue silk, and purple,the work of the embroidere, with a breastplate of judgment, and withUrim and Thummim;   

{45:11} With twisted scarlet, the work of the cunning workman, withprecious stones graven like seals, and set in gold, the work of thejeweller, with a writing engraved for a memorial, after the number ofthe tribes of Israel.   

{45:12} He set a crown of gold upon the mitre, wherein was engravedHoliness, an ornament of honour, a costly work, the desires of theeyes, goodly and beautiful.   

{45:13} Before him there were none such, neither did ever anystranger put them on, but only his children and his children's childrenperpetually.   

{45:14} Their sacrifices shall be wholly consumed every day twicecontinually.   

{45:15} Moses consecrated him, and anointed him with holy oil: thiswas appointed unto him by an everlasting covenant, and to his seed, solong as the heavens should remain, that they should minister unto him,and execute the office of the priesthood, and bless the people in hisname.   

{45:16} He chose him out of all men living to offer sacrifices tothe Lord, incense, and a sweet savour, for a memorial, to makereconciliation for his people.   

{45:17} He gave unto him his commandments, and authority in thestatutes of judgments, that he should teach Jacob the testimonies, andinform Israel in his laws.   

{45:18} Strangers conspired together against him, and maligned himin the wilderness, even the men that were of Dathan's and Abiron'sside, and the congregation of Core, with fury and wrath.   

{45:19} This the Lord saw, and it displeased him, and in hiswrathful indignation were they consumed: he did wonders upon them, toconsume them with the fiery flame.   

{45:20} But he made Aaron more honourable, and gave him an heritage,and divided unto him the firstfruits of the increase; especially heprepared bread in abundance:   

{45:21} For they eat of the sacrifices of the Lord, which he gaveunto him and his seed.   

{45:22} Howbeit in the land of the people he had no inheritance,neither had he any portion among the people: for the Lord himself ishis portion and inheritance.   

{45:23} The third in glory is Phinees the son of Eleazar, because hehad zeal in the fear of the Lord, and stood up with good courage ofheart: when the people were turned back, and made reconciliation forIsrael.   

{45:24} Therefore was there a covenant of peace made with him, thathe should be the chief of the sanctuary and of his people, and that heand his posterity should have the dignity of the priesthood for ever:   

{45:25} According to the covenant made with David son of Jesse, ofthe tribe of Juda, that the inheritance of the king should be to hisposterity alone: so the inheritance of Aaron should also be unto hisseed.   

{45:26} God give you wisdom in your heart to judge his people inrighteousness, that their good things be not abolished, and that theirglory may endure for ever.   

{46:1} Jesus the son a Nave was valiant in the wars, and was thesuccessor of Moses in prophecies, who according to his name was madegreat for the saving of the elect of God, and taking vengeance of theenemies that rose up against them, that he might set Israel in theirinheritance.   

{46:2} How great glory gat he, when he did lift up his hands, andstretched out his sword against the cities!   

{46:3} Who before him so stood to it? for the Lord himself broughthis enemies unto him.   

{46:4} Did not the sun go back by his means? and was not one day aslong as two?   

{46:5} He called upon the most high Lord, when the enemies pressedupon him on every side; and the great Lord heard him.   

{46:6} And with hailstones of mighty power he made the battle tofall violently upon the nations, and in the descent [of Beth-horon] hedestroyed them that resisted, that the nations might know all theirstrength, because he fought in the sight of the Lord, and he followedthe Mighty One.   

{46:7} In the time of Moses also he did a work of mercy, he andCaleb the son of Jephunne, in that they withstood the congregation, andwithheld the people from sin, and appeased the wicked murmuring.   

{46:8} And of six hundred thousand people on foot, they two werepreserved to bring them in to the heritage, even unto the land thatfloweth with milk and honey.   

{46:9} The Lord gave strength also unto Caleb, which remained withhim unto his old age: so that he entered upon the high places of theland, and his seed obtained it for an heritage:   

{46:10} That all the children of Israel might see that it is good tofollow the Lord.   

{46:11} And concerning the judges, every one by name, whose heartwent not a whoring, nor departed from the Lord, let their memory beblessed.   

{46:12} Let their bones flourish out of their place, and let thename of them that were honoured be continued upon their children.   

{46:13} Samuel, the prophet of the Lord, beloved of his Lord,established a kingdom, and anointed princes over his people.   

{46:14} By the law of the Lord he judged the congregation, and theLord had respect unto Jacob.   

{46:15} By his faithfulness he was found a true prophet, and by hisword he was known to be faithful in vision.   

{46:16} He called upon the mighty Lord, when his enemies pressedupon him on every side, when he offered the sucking lamb.   

{46:17} And the Lord thundered from heaven, and with a great noisemade his voice to be heard.   

{46:18} And he destroyed the rulers of the Tyrians, and all theprinces cf the Philistines.   

{46:19} And before his long sleep he made protestations in the sightof the Lord and his anointed, I have not taken any man's goods, so muchas a shoe: and no man did accuse him.   

{46:20} And after his death he prophesied, and shewed the king hisend, and lifted up his voice from the earth in prophecy, to blot outthe wickedness of the people.   

{47:1} And after him rose up Nathan to prophesy in the time of David.   

{47:2} As is the fat taken away from the peace offering, so wasDavid chosen out of the children of Israel.   

{47:3} He played with lions as with kids, and with bears as withlambs.   

{47:4} Slew he not a giant, when he was yet but young? and did henot take away reproach from the people, when he lifted up his hand withthe stone in the sling, and beat down the boasting of Goliath?   

{47:5} For he called upon the most high Lord; and he gave himstrength in his right hand to slay that mighty warrior, and set up thehorn of his people.   

{47:6} So the people honoured him with ten thousands, and praisedhim in the blessings of the Lord, in that he gave him a crown of glory.   

{47:7} For he destroyed the enemies on every side, and brought tonought the Philistines his adversaries, and brake their horn in sunderunto this day.   

{47:8} In all his works he praised the Holy One most high with wordsof glory; with his whole heart he sung songs, and loved him that madehim.   

{47:9} He set singers also before the altar, that by their voicesthey might make sweet melody, and daily sing praises in their songs.   

{47:10} He beautified their feasts, and set in order the solemntimes until the end, that they might praise his holy name, and that thetemple might sound from morning.   

{47:11} The Lord took away his sins, and exalted his horn for ever:he gave him a covenant of kings, and a throne of glory in Israel.   

{47:12} After him rose up a wise son, and for his sake he dwelt atlarge.   

{47:13} Solomon reigned in a peaceable time, and was honoured; forGod made all quiet round about him, that he might build an house in hisname, and prepare his sanctuary for ever.   

{47:14} How wise wast thou in thy youth and, as a flood, filled withunderstanding!   

{47:15} Thy soul covered the whole earth, and thou filledst it withdark parables.   

{47:16} Thy name went far unto the islands; and for thy peace thouwast beloved.   

{47:17} The countries marvelled at thee for thy songs, and proverbs,and parables, and interpretations.   

{47:18} By the name of the Lord God, which is called the Lord God ofIsrael, thou didst gather gold as tin and didst multiply silver as lead.   

{47:19} Thou didst bow thy loins unto women, and by thy body thouwast brought into subjection.   

{47:20} Thou didst stain thy honour, and pollute thy seed: so thatthou broughtest wrath upon thy children, and wast grieved for thy folly.   

{47:21} So the kingdom was divided, and out of Ephraim ruled arebellious kingdom.   

{47:22} But the Lord will never leave off his mercy, neither shallany of his works perish, neither will he abolish the posterity of hiselect, and the seed of him that loveth him he will not take away:wherefore he gave a remnant unto Jacob, and out of him a root untoDavid.   

{47:23} Thus rested Solomon with his fathers, and of his seed heleft behind him Roboam, even the foolishness of the people, and onethat had no understanding, who turned away the people through hiscounsel. There was also Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who caused Israel tosin, and shewed Ephraim the way of sin:   

{47:24} And their sins were multiplied exceedingly, that they weredriven out of the land.   

{47:25} For they sought out all wickedness, till the vengeance cameupon them.   

{48:1} Then stood up Elias the prophet as fire, and his word burnedlike a lamp.   

{48:2} He brought a sore famine upon them, and by his zeal hediminished their number.   

{48:3} By the word of the Lord he shut up the heaven, and also threetimes brought down fire.   

{48:4} O Elias, how wast thou honoured in thy wondrous deeds! andwho may glory like unto thee!   

{48:5} Who didst raise up a dead man from death, and his soul fromthe place of the dead, by the word of the most High:   

{48:6} Who broughtest kings to destruction, and honorable men fromtheir bed:   

{48:7} Who heardest the rebuke of the Lord in Sinai, and in Horebthe judgment of vengeance:   

{48:8} Who annointedst kings to take revenge, and prophets tosucceed after him:   

{48:9} Who was taken up in a whirlwind of fire, and in a chariot offiery horses:   

{48:10} Who wast ordained for reproofs in their times, to pacify thewrath of the Lord's judgment, before it brake forth into fury, and toturn the heart of the father unto the son, and to restore the tribes ofJacob.   

{48:11} Blessed are they that saw thee, and slept in love; for weshall surely live.   

{48:12} Elias it was, who was covered with a whirlwind: and Eliseuswas filled with his spirit: whilst he lived, he was not moved with thepresence of any prince, neither could any bring him into subjection.   

{48:13} No word could overcome him; and after his death his bodyprophesied.   

{48:14} He did wonders in his life, and at his death were his worksmarvellous.   

{48:15} For all this the people repented not, neither departed theyfrom their sins, till they were spoiled and carried out of their land,and were scattered through all the earth: yet there remained a smallpeople, and a ruler in the house of David:   

{48:16} Of whom some did that which was pleasing to God, and somemultiplied sins.   

{48:17} Ezekias fortified his city, and brought in water into themidst thereof: he digged the hard rock with iron, and made wells forwaters.   

{48:18} In his time Sennacherib came up, and sent Rabsaces, andlifted up his hand against Sion, and boasted proudly.   

{48:19} Then trembled their hearts and hands, and they were in pain,as women in travail.   

{48:20} But they called upon the Lord which is merciful, andstretched out their hands toward him: and immediately the Holy Oneheard them out of heaven, and delivered them by the ministry of Esay.   

{48:21} He smote the host of the Assyrians, and his angel destroyedthem.   

{48:22} For Ezekias had done the thing that pleased the Lord, andwas strong in the ways of David his father, as Esay the prophet, whowas great and faithful in his vision, had commanded him.   

{48:23} In his time the sun went backward, and he lengthened theking's life.   

{48:24} He saw by an excellent spirit what should come to pass atthe last, and he comforted them that mourned in Sion.   

{48:25} He shewed what should come to pass for ever, and secretthings or ever they came.   

{49:1} The remembrance of Josias is like the composition of theperfume that is made by the art of the apothecary: it is sweet as honeyin all mouths, and as musick at a banquet of wine.   

{49:2} He behaved himself uprightly in the conversion of the people,and took away the abominations of iniquity.   

{49:3} He directed his heart unto the Lord, and in the time of theungodly he established the worship of God.   

{49:4} All, except David and Ezekias and Josias, were defective: forthey forsook the law of the most High, even the kings of Juda failed.   

{49:5} Therefore he gave their power unto others, and their glory toa strange nation.   

{49:6} They burnt the chosen city of the sanctuary, and made thestreets desolate, according to the prophecy of Jeremias.   

{49:7} For they entreated him evil, who nevertheless was a prophet,sanctified in his mother's womb, that he might root out, and afflict,and destroy; and that he might build up also, and plant.   

{49:8} It was Ezekiel who saw the glorious vision, which was shewedhim upon the chariot of the cherubims.   

{49:9} For he made mention of the enemies under the figure of therain, and directed them that went right.   

{49:10} And of the twelve prophets let the memorial be blessed, andlet their bones flourish again out of their place: for they comfortedJacob, and delivered them by assured hope.   

{49:11} How shall we magnify Zorobabel? even he was as a signet onthe right hand:   

{49:12} So was Jesus the son of Josedec: who in their time buildedthe house, and set up an holy temple to the Lord, which was preparedfor everlasting glory.   

{49:13} And among the elect was Neemias, whose renown is great, whoraised up for us the walls that were fallen, and set up the gates andthe bars, and raised up our ruins again.   

{49:14} But upon the earth was no man created like Enoch; for he wastaken from the earth.   

{49:15} Neither was there a young man born like Joseph, a governorof his brethren, a stay of the people, whose bones were regarded of theLord.   

{49:16} Sem and Seth were in great honour among men, and so was Adamabove every living thing in creation.   

{50:1} Simon the high priest, the son of Onias, who in his liferepaired the house again, and in his days fortified the temple:   

{50:2} And by him was built from the foundation the double height,the high fortress of the wall about the temple:   

{50:3} In his days the cistern to receive water, being in compass asthe sea, was covered with plates of brass:   

{50:4} He took care of the temple that it should not fall, andfortified the city against besieging:   

{50:5} How was he honoured in the midst of the people in his comingout of the sanctuary!   

{50:6} He was as the morning star in the midst of a cloud, and asthe moon at the full:   

{50:7} As the sun shining upon the temple of the most High, and asthe rainbow giving light in the bright clouds:   

{50:8} And as the flower of roses in the spring of the year, aslilies by the rivers of waters, and as the branches of the frankincensetree in the time of summer:   

{50:9} As fire and incense in the censer, and as a vessel of beatengold set with all manner of precious stones:   

{50:10} And as a fair olive tree budding forth fruit, and as acypress tree which groweth up to the clouds.   

{50:11} When he put on the robe of honour, and was clothed with theperfection of glory, when he went up to the holy altar, he made thegarment of holiness honourable.   

{50:12} When he took the portions out of the priests' hands, hehimself stood by the hearth of the altar, compassed about, as a youngcedar in Libanus; and as palm trees compassed they him round about.   

{50:13} So were all the sons of Aaron in their glory, and theoblations of the Lord in their hands, before all the congregation ofIsrael.   

{50:14} And finishing the service at the altar, that he might adornthe offering of the most high Almighty,   

{50:15} He stretched out his hand to the cup, and poured of theblood of the grape, he poured out at the foot of the altar asweetsmelling savour unto the most high King of all.   

{50:16} Then shouted the sons of Aaron, and sounded the silvertrumpets, and made a great noise to be heard, for a remembrance beforethe most High.   

{50:17} Then all the people together hasted, and fell down to theearth upon their faces to worship their Lord God Almighty, the mostHigh.   

{50:18} The singers also sang praises with their voices, with greatvariety of sounds was there made sweet melody.   

{50:19} And the people besought the Lord, the most High, by prayerbefore him that is merciful, till the solemnity of the Lord was ended,and they had finished his service.   

{50:20} Then he went down, and lifted up his hands over the wholecongregation of the children of Israel, to give the blessing of theLord with his lips, and to rejoice in his name.   

{50:21} And they bowed themselves down to worship the second time,that they might receive a blessing from the most High.   

{50:22} Now therefore bless ye the God of all, which only doethwondrous things every where, which exalteth our days from the womb, anddealeth with us according to his mercy.   

{50:23} He grant us joyfulness of heart, and that peace may be inour days in Israel for ever:   

{50:24} That he would confirm his mercy with us, and deliver us athis time!   

{50:25} There be two manner of nations which my heart abhorreth, andthe third is no nation:   

{50:26} They that sit upon the mountain of Samaria, and they thatdwell among the Philistines, and that foolish people that dwell inSichem.   

{50:27} Jesus the son of Sirach of Jerusalem hath written in thisbook the instruction of understanding and knowledge, who out of hisheart poured forth wisdom.   

{50:28} Blessed is he that shall be exercised in these things; andhe that layeth them up in his heart shall become wise.   

{50:29} For if he do them, he shall be strong to all things: for thelight of the Lord leadeth him, who giveth wisdom to the godly. Blessedbe the name of the Lord for ever. Amen, Amen.   A Prayer of Jesus the son of Sirach.   

{51:1} I will thank thee, O Lord and King, and praise thee, O God mySaviour: I do give praise unto thy name:   

{51:2} For thou art my defender and helper, and has preserved mybody from destruction, and from the snare of the slanderous tongue, andfrom the lips that forge lies, and has been mine helper against mineadversaries:   

{51:3} And hast delivered me, according to the multitude of theymercies and greatness of thy name, from the teeth of them that wereready to devour me, and out of the hands of such as sought after mylife, and from the manifold afflictions which I had;   

{51:4} From the choking of fire on every side, and from the midst ofthe fire which I kindled not;   

{51:5} From the depth of the belly of hell, from an unclean tongue,and from lying words.   

{51:6} By an accusation to the king from an unrighteous tongue mysoul drew near even unto death, my life was near to the hell beneath.   

{51:7} They compassed me on every side, and there was no man to helpme: I looked for the succour of men, but there was none.   

{51:8} Then thought I upon thy mercy, O Lord, and upon thy acts ofold, how thou deliverest such as wait for thee, and savest them out ofthe hands of the enemies.   

{51:9} Then lifted I up my supplications from the earth, and prayedfor deliverance from death.   

{51:10} I called upon the Lord, the Father of my Lord, that he wouldnot leave me in the days of my trouble, and in the time of the proud,when there was no help.   

{51:11} I will praise thy name continually, and will sing praiseswith thanksgiving; and so my prayer was heard:   

{51:12} For thou savedst me from destruction, and deliveredst mefrom the evil time: therefore will I give thanks, and praise thee, andbless they name, O Lord.   

{51:13} When I was yet young, or ever I went abroad, I desiredwisdom openly in my prayer.   

{51:14} I prayed for her before the temple, and will seek her outeven to the end.   

{51:15} Even from the flower till the grape was ripe hath my heartdelighted in her: my foot went the right way, from my youth up sought Iafter her.   

{51:16} I bowed down mine ear a little, and received her, and gatmuch learning.   

{51:17} I profited therein, therefore will I ascribe glory unto himthat giveth me wisdom.   

{51:18} For I purposed to do after her, and earnestly I followedthat which is good; so shall I not be confounded.   

{51:19} My soul hath wrestled with her, and in my doings I wasexact: I stretched forth my hands to the heaven above, and bewailed myignorances of her.   

{51:20} I directed my soul unto her, and I found her in pureness: Ihave had my heart joined with her from the beginning, therefore shall Inot be foresaken.   

{51:21} My heart was troubled in seeking her: therefore have Igotten a good possession.   

{51:22} The Lord hath given me a tongue for my reward, and I willpraise him therewith.   

{51:23} Draw near unto me, ye unlearned, and dwell in the house oflearning.   

{51:24} Wherefore are ye slow, and what say ye to these things,seeing your souls are very thirsty?   

{51:25} I opened my mouth, and said, Buy her for yourselves withoutmoney.   

{51:26} Put your neck under the yoke, and let your soul receiveinstruction: she is hard at hand to find.   

{51:27} Behold with your eyes, how that I have but little labour,and have gotten unto me much rest.   

{51:28} Get learning with a great sum of money, and get much gold byher.   

{51:29} Let your soul rejoice in his mercy, and be not ashamed ofhis praise.   

{51:30} Work your work betimes, and in his time he will give youyour reward.The Book of Baruch   

{1:1} And these are the words of the book, which Baruch the son ofNerias, the son of Maasias, the son of Sedecias, the son of Asadias,the son of Chelcias, wrote in Babylon,   

{1:2} In the fifth year, and in the seventh day of the month, whattime as the Chaldeans took Jerusalem, and burnt it with fire.   

{1:3} And Baruch did read the words of this book in the hearing ofJechonias the son of Joachim king of Juda, and in the ears of all thepeople that came to hear the book,   

{1:4} And in the hearing of the nobles, and of the king's sons, andin the hearing of the elders, and of all the people, from the lowestunto the highest, even of all them that dwelt at Babylon by the riverSud.   

{1:5} Whereupon they wept, fasted, and prayed before the Lord.   

{1:6} They made also a collection of money according to every man'spower:   

{1:7} And they sent it to Jerusalem unto Joachim the high priest,the son of Chelcias, son of Salom, and to the priests, and to all thepeople which were found with him at Jerusalem,   

{1:8} At the same time when he received the vessels of the house ofthe Lord, that were carried out of the temple, to return them into theland of Juda, the tenth day of the month Sivan, namely, silver vessels,which Sedecias the son of Josias king of Jada had made,   

{1:9} After that Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon had carried awayJechonias, and the princes, and the captives, and the mighty men, andthe people of the land, from Jerusalem, and brought them unto Babylon.   

{1:10} And they said, Behold, we have sent you money to buy youburnt offerings, and sin offerings, and incense, and prepare ye manna,and offer upon the altar of the Lord our God;   

{1:11} And pray for the life of Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon, andfor the life of Balthasar his son, that their days may be upon earth asthe days of heaven:   

{1:12} And the Lord will give us strength, and lighten our eyes, andwe shall live under the shadow of Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon, andunder the shadow of Balthasar his son, and we shall serve them manydays, and find favour in their sight.   

{1:13} Pray for us also unto the Lord our God, for we have sinnedagainst the Lord our God; and unto this day the fury of the Lord andhis wrath is not turned from us.   

{1:14} And ye shall read this book which we have sent unto you, tomake confession in the house of the Lord, upon the feasts and solemndays.   

{1:15} And ye shall say, To the Lord our God belongethrighteousness, but unto us the confusion of faces, as it is come topass this day, unto them of Juda, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem,   

{1:16} And to our kings, and to our princes, and to our priests, andto our prophets, and to our fathers:   

{1:17} For we have sinned before the Lord,   

{1:18} And disobeyed him, and have not hearkened unto the voice ofthe Lord our God, to walk in the commandments that he gave us openly:   

{1:19} Since the day that the Lord brought our forefathers out ofthe land of Egypt, unto this present day, we have been disobedient untothe Lord our God, and we have been negligent in not hearing his voice.   

{1:20} Wherefore the evils cleaved unto us, and the curse, which theLord appointed by Moses his servant at the time that he brought ourfathers out of the land of Egypt, to give us a land that floweth withmilk and honey, like as it is to see this day.   

{1:21} Nevertheless we have not hearkened unto the voice of the Lordour God, according unto all the words of the prophets, whom he sentunto us:   

{1:22} But every man followed the imagination of his own wickedheart, to serve strange gods, and to do evil in the sight of the Lordour God.   

{2:1} Therefore the Lord hath made good his word, which hepronounced against us, and against our judges that judged Israel, andagainst our kings, and against our princes, and against the men ofIsrael and Juda,   

{2:2} To bring upon us great plagues, such as never happened underthe whole heaven, as it came to pass in Jerusalem, according to thethings that were written in the law of Moses;   

{2:3} That a man should eat the flesh of his own son, and the fleshof his own daughter.   

{2:4} Moreover he hath delivered them to be in subjection to all thekingdoms that are round about us, to be as a reproach and desolationamong all the people round about, where the Lord hath scattered them.   

{2:5} Thus we were cast down, and not exalted, because we havesinned against the Lord our God, and have not been obedient unto hisvoice.   

{2:6} To the Lord our God appertaineth righteousness: but unto usand to our fathers open shame, as appeareth this day.   

{2:7} For all these plagues are come upon us, which the Lord hathpronounced against us   

{2:8} Yet have we not prayed before the Lord, that we might turnevery one from the imaginations of his wicked heart.   

{2:9} Wherefore the Lord watched over us for evil, and the Lord hathbrought it upon us: for the Lord is righteous in all his works which hehath commanded us.   

{2:10} Yet we have not hearkened unto his voice, to walk in thecommandments of the Lord, that he hath set before us.   

{2:11} And now, O Lord God of Israel, that hast brought thy peopleout of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand, and high arm, and withsigns, and with wonders, and with great power, and hast gotten thyselfa name, as appeareth this day:   

{2:12} O Lord our God, we have sinned, we have done ungodly, we havedealt unrighteously in all thine ordinances.   

{2:13} Let thy wrath turn from us: for we are but a few left amongthe heathen, where thou hast scattered us.   

{2:14} Hear our prayers, O Lord, and our petitions, and deliver usfor thine own sake, and give us favour in the sight of them which haveled us away:   

{2:15} That all the earth may know that thou art the Lord our God,because Israel and his posterity is called by thy name.   

{2:16} O Lord, look down from thine holy house, and consider us: bowdown thine ear, O Lord, to hear us.   

{2:17} Open thine eyes, and behold; for the dead that are in thegraves, whose souls are taken from their bodies, will give unto theLord neither praise nor righteousness:   

{2:18} But the soul that is greatly vexed, which goeth stooping andfeeble, and the eyes that fail, and the hungry soul, will give theepraise and righteousness, O Lord.   

{2:19} Therefore we do not make our humble supplication before thee,O Lord our God, for the righteousness of our fathers, and of our kings.   

{2:20} For thou hast sent out thy wrath and indignation upon us, asthou hast spoken by thy servants the prophets, saying,   

{2:21} Thus saith the Lord, Bow down your shoulders to serve theking of Babylon: so shall ye remain in the land that I gave unto yourfathers.   

{2:22} But if ye will not hear the voice of the Lord, to serve theking of Babylon,   

{2:23} I will cause to cease out of the cites of Judah, and fromwithout Jerusalem, the voice of mirth, and the voice of joy, the voiceof the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride: and the whole land shallbe desolate of inhabitants.   

{2:24} But we would not hearken unto thy voice, to serve the king ofBabylon: therefore hast thou made good the words that thou spakest bythy servants the prophets, namely, that the bones of our kings, and thebones of our fathers, should be taken out of their place.   

{2:25} And, lo, they are cast out to the heat of the day, and to thefrost of the night, and they died in great miseries by famine, bysword, and by pestilence.   

{2:26} And the house which is called by thy name hast thou laidwaste, as it is to be seen this day, for the wickedness of the house ofIsrael and the house of Juda.   

{2:27} O Lord our God, thou hast dealt with us after all thygoodness, and according to all that great mercy of thine,   

{2:28} As thou spakest by thy servant Moses in the day when thoudidst command him to write the law before the children of Israel,saying,   

{2:29} If ye will not hear my voice, surely this very greatmultitude shall be turned into a small number among the nations, whereI will scatter them.   

{2:30} For I knew that they would not hear me, because it is astiffnecked people: but in the land of their captivities they shallremember themselves.   

{2:31} And shall know that I am the Lord their God: for I will givethem an heart, and ears to hear:   

{2:32} And they shall praise me in the land of their captivity, andthink upon my name,   

{2:33} And return from their stiff neck, and from their wickeddeeds: for they shall remember the way of their fathers, which sinnedbefore the Lord.   

{2:34} And I will bring them again into the land which I promisedwith an oath unto their fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and theyshall be lords of it: and I will increase them, and they shall not bediminished.   

{2:35} And I will make an everlasting covenant with them to be theirGod, and they shall be my people: and I will no more drive my people ofIsrael out of the land that I have given them.   

{3:1} O Lord Almighty, God of Israel, the soul in anguish thetroubled spirit, crieth unto thee.   

{3:2} Hear, O Lord, and have mercy; ar thou art merciful: and havepity upon us, because we have sinned before thee.   

{3:3} For thou endurest for ever, and we perish utterly.   

{3:4} O Lord Almighty, thou God of Israel, hear now the prayers ofthe dead Israelites, and of their children, which have sinned beforethee, and not hearkened unto the voice of thee their God: for the whichcause these plagues cleave unto us.   

{3:5} Remember not the iniquities of our forefathers: but think uponthy power and thy name now at this time.   

{3:6} For thou art the Lord our God, and thee, O Lord, will wepraise.   

{3:7} And for this cause thou hast put thy fear in our hearts, tothe intent that we should call upon thy name, and praise thee in ourcaptivity: for we have called to mind all the iniquity of ourforefathers, that sinned before thee.   

{3:8} Behold, we are yet this day in our captivity, where thou hastscattered us, for a reproach and a curse, and to be subject topayments, according to all the iniquities of our fathers, whichdeparted from the Lord our God.   

{3:9} Hear, Israel, the commandments of life: give ear to understandwisdom.   

{3:10} How happeneth it Israel, that thou art in thine enemies'land, that thou art waxen old in a strange country, that thou artdefiled with the dead,   

{3:11} That thou art counted with them that go down into the grave?   

{3:12} Thou hast forsaken the fountain of wisdom.   

{3:13} For if thou hadst walked in the way of God, thou shouldesthave dwelled in peace for ever.   

{3:14} Learn where is wisdom, where is strength, where isunderstanding; that thou mayest know also where is length of days, andlife, where is the light of the eyes, and peace.   

{3:15} Who hath found out her place? or who hath come into hertreasures ?   

{3:16} Where are the princes of the heathen become, and such asruled the beasts upon the earth;   

{3:17} They that had their pastime with the fowls of the air, andthey that hoarded up silver and gold, wherein men trust, and made noend of their getting?   

{3:18} For they that wrought in silver, and were so careful, andwhose works are unsearchable,   

{3:19} They are vanished and gone down to the grave, and others arecome up in their steads.   

{3:20} Young men have seen light, and dwelt upon the earth: but theway of knowledge have they not known,   

{3:21} Nor understood the paths thereof, nor laid hold of it: theirchildren were far off from that way.   

{3:22} It hath not been heard of in Chanaan, neither hath it beenseen in Theman.   

{3:23} The Agarenes that seek wisdom upon earth, the merchants ofMeran and of Theman, the authors of fables, and searchers out ofunderstanding; none of these have known the way of wisdom, or rememberher paths.   

{3:24} O Israel, how great is the house of God! and how large is theplace of his possession!   

{3:25} Great, and hath none end; high, and unmeasurable.   

{3:26} There were the giants famous from the beginning, that were ofso great stature, and so expert in war.   

{3:27} Those did not the Lord choose, neither gave he the way ofknowledge unto them:   

{3:28} But they were destroyed, because they had no wisdom, andperished through their own foolishness.   

{3:29} Who hath gone up into heaven, and taken her, and brought herdown from the clouds?   

{3:30} Who hath gone over the sea, and found her, and will bring herfor pure gold?   

{3:31} No man knoweth her way, nor thinketh of her path.   

{3:32} But he that knoweth all things knoweth her, and hath foundher out with his understanding: he that prepared the earth for evermorehath filled it with fourfooted beasts:   

{3:33} He that sendeth forth light, and it goeth, calleth it again,and it obeyeth him with fear.   

{3:34} The stars shined in their watches, and rejoiced: when hecalleth them, they say, Here we be; and so with cheerfulness theyshewed light unto him that made them.   

{3:35} This is our God, and there shall none other be accounted ofin comparison of him   

{3:36} He hath found out all the way of knowledge, and hath given itunto Jacob his servant, and to Israel his beloved.   

{3:37} Afterward did he shew himself upon earth, and conversed withmen.   

{4:1} This is the book of the commandments of God, and the law thatendureth for ever: all they that keep it shall come to life; but suchas leave it shall die.   

{4:2} Turn thee, O Jacob, and take hold of it: walk in the presenceof the light thereof, that thou mayest be illuminated.   

{4:3} Give not thine honour to another, nor the things that areprofitable unto thee to a strange nation.   

{4:4} O Israel, happy are we: for things that are pleasing to Godare made known unto us.   

{4:5} Be of good cheer, my people, the memorial of Israel.   

{4:6} Ye were sold to the nations, not for [your] destruction: butbecause ye moved God to wrath, ye were delivered unto the enemies.   

{4:7} For ye provoked him that made you by sacrificing unto devils,and not to God.   

{4:8} Ye have forgotten the everlasting God, that brought you up;and ye have grieved Jerusalem, that nursed you.   

{4:9} For when she saw the wrath of God coming upon you, she said,Hearken, O ye that dwell about Sion: God hath brought upon me greatmourning;   

{4:10} For I saw the captivity of my sons and daughters, which theEverlasting brought upon them.   

{4:11} With joy did I nourish them; but sent them away with weepingand mourning.   

{4:12} Let no man rejoice over me, a widow, and forsaken of many,who for the sins of my children am left desolate; because they departedfrom the law of God.   

{4:13} They knew not his statutes, nor walked in the ways of hiscommandments, nor trod in the paths of discipline in his righteousness.   

{4:14} Let them that dwell about Sion come, and remember ye thecaptivity of my sons and daughters, which the Everlasting hath broughtupon them.   

{4:15} For he hath brought a nation upon them from far, a shamelessnation, and of a strange language, who neither reverenced old man, norpitied child.   

{4:16} These have carried away the dear beloved children of thewidow, and left her that was alone desolate without daughters.   

{4:17} But what can I help you?   

{4:18} For he that brought these plagues upon you will deliver youfrom the hands of your enemies.   

{4:19} Go your way, O my children, go your way: for I am leftdesolate.   

{4:20} I have put off the clothing of peace, and put upon me thesackcloth of my prayer: I will cry unto the Everlasting in my days.   

{4:21} Be of good cheer, O my children, cry unto the Lord, and hewill deliver you from the power and hand of the enemies.   

{4:22} For my hope is in the Everlasting, that he will save you; andjoy is come unto me from the Holy One, because of the mercy which shallsoon come unto you from the Everlasting our Saviour.   

{4:23} For I sent you out with mourning and weeping: but God willgive you to me again with joy and gladness for ever.   

{4:24} Like as now the neighbours of Sion have seen your captivity:so shall they see shortly your salvation from our God which shall comeupon you with great glory, and brightness of the Everlasting.   

{4:25} My children, suffer patiently the wrath that is come upon youfrom God: for thine enemy hath persecuted thee; but shortly thou shaltsee his destruction, and shalt tread upon his neck.   

{4:26} My delicate ones have gone rough ways, and were taken away asa flock caught of the enemies.   

{4:27} Be of good comfort, O my children, and cry unto God: for yeshall be remembered of him that brought these things upon you.   

{4:28} For as it was your mind to go astray from God: so, beingreturned, seek him ten times more.   

{4:29} For he that hath brought these plagues upon you shall bringyou everlasting joy with your salvation.   

{4:30} Take a good heart, O Jerusalem: for he that gave thee thatname will comfort thee.   

{4:31} Miserable are they that afflicted thee, and rejoiced at thyfall.   

{4:32} Miserable are the cities which thy children served: miserableis she that received thy sons.   

{4:33} For as she rejoiced at thy ruin, and was glad of thy fall: soshall she be grieved for her own desolation.   

{4:34} For I will take away the rejoicing of her great multitude,and her pride shall be turned into mourning.   

{4:35} For fire shall come upon her from the Everlasting, long toendure; and she shall be inhabited of devils for a great time.   

{4:36} O Jerusalem, look about thee toward the east, and behold thejoy that cometh unto thee from God.   

{4:37} Lo, thy sons come, whom thou sentest away, they come gatheredtogether from the east to the west by the word of the Holy One,rejoicing in the glory of God.   

{5:1} Put off, O Jerusalem, the garment of mourning and affliction,and put on the comeliness of the glory that cometh from God for ever.   

{5:2} Cast about thee a double garment of the righteousness whichcometh from God; and set a diadem on thine head of the glory of theEverlasting.   

{5:3} For God will shew thy brightness unto every country underheaven.   

{5:4} For thy name shall be called of God for ever The peace ofrighteousness, and The glory of God's worship.   

{5:5} Arise, O Jerusalem, and stand on high, and look about towardthe east, and behold thy children gathered from the west unto the eastby the word of the Holy One, rejoicing in the remembrance of God.   

{5:6} For they departed from thee on foot, and were led away oftheir enemies: but God bringeth them unto thee exalted with glory, aschildren of the kingdom.   

{5:7} For God hath appointed that every high hill, and banks of longcontinuance, should be cast down, and valleys filled up, to make eventhe ground, that Israel may go safely in the glory of God,   

{5:8} Moreover even the woods and every sweetsmelling tree shallovershadow Israel by the commandment of God.   

{5:9} For God shall lead Israel with joy in the light of his glorywith the mercy and righteousness that cometh from him.The Epistle [or Letter] of Jeremiah [Jeremy]   

{6:1} A copy of an epistle, which Jeremy sent unto them which wereto be led captives into Babylon by the king of the Babylonians, tocertify them, as it was commanded him of God.   

{6:2} Because of the sins which ye have committed before God, yeshall be led away captives into Babylon by Nabuchodonosor king of theBabylonians.   

{6:3} So when ye be come unto Babylon, ye shall remain there manyyears, and for a long season, namely, seven generations: and after thatI will bring you away peaceably from thence.   

{6:4} Now shall ye see in Babylon gods of silver, and of gold, andof wood, borne upon shoulders, which cause the nations to fear.   

{6:5} Beware therefore that ye in no wise be like to strangers,neither be ye and of them, when ye see the multitude before them andbehind them, worshipping them.   

{6:6} But say ye in your hearts, O Lord, we must worship thee.   

{6:7} For mine angel is with you, and I myself caring for your souls.   

{6:8} As for their tongue, it is polished by the workman, and theythemselves are gilded and laid over with silver; yet are they butfalse, and cannot speak.   

{6:9} And taking gold, as it were for a virgin that loveth to gogay, they make crowns for the heads of their gods.   

{6:10} Sometimes also the priests convey from their gods gold andsilver, and bestow it upon themselves.   

{6:11} Yea, they will give thereof to the common harlots, and deckthem as men with garments, [being] gods of silver, and gods of gold,and wood.   

{6:12} Yet cannot these gods save themselves from rust and moth,though they be covered with purple raiment.   

{6:13} They wipe their faces because of the dust of the temple, whenthere is much upon them.   

{6:14} And he that cannot put to death one that offendeth himholdeth a sceptre, as though he were a judge of the country.   

{6:15} He hath also in his right hand a dagger and an ax: but cannotdeliver himself from war and thieves.   

{6:16} Whereby they are known not to be gods: therefore fear themnot.   

{6:17} For like as a vessel that a man useth is nothing worth whenit is broken; even so it is with their gods: when they be set up in thetemple, their eyes be full of dust through the feet of them that comein.   

{6:18} And as the doors are made sure on every side upon him thatoffendeth the king, as being committed to suffer death: even so thepriests make fast their temples with doors, with locks, and bars, lesttheir gods be spoiled with robbers.   

{6:19} They light them candles, yea, more than for themselves,whereof they cannot see one.   

{6:20} They are as one of the beams of the temple, yet they saytheir hearts are gnawed upon by things creeping out of the earth; andwhen they eat them and their clothes, they feel it not.   

{6:21} Their faces are blacked through the smoke that cometh out ofthe temple.   

{6:22} Upon their bodies and heads sit bats, swallows, and birds,and the cats also.   

{6:23} By this ye may know that they are no gods: therefore fearthem not.   

{6:24} Notwithstanding the gold that is about them to make thembeautiful, except they wipe off the rust, they will not shine: forneither when they were molten did they feel it.   

{6:25} The things wherein there is no breath are bought for a mosthigh price.   

{6:26} They are borne upon shoulders, having no feet whereby theydeclare unto men that they be nothing worth.   

{6:27} They also that serve them are ashamed: for if they fall tothe ground at any time, they cannot rise up again of themselves:neither, if one set them upright, can they move of themselves: neither,if they be bowed down, can they make themselves straight: but they setgifts before them as unto dead men.   

{6:28} As for the things that are sacrificed unto them, theirpriests sell and abuse; in like manner their wives lay up part thereofin salt; but unto the poor and impotent they give nothing of it.   

{6:29} Menstruous women and women in childbed eat their sacrifices:by these things ye may know that they are no gods: fear them not.   

{6:30} For how can they be called gods? because women set meatbefore the gods of silver, gold, and wood.   

{6:31} And the priests sit in their temples, having their clothesrent, and their heads and beards shaven, and nothing upon their heads.   

{6:32} They roar and cry before their gods, as men do at the feastwhen one is dead.   

{6:33} The priests also take off their garments, and clothe theirwives and children.   

{6:34} Whether it be evil that one doeth unto them, or good, theyare not able to recompense it: they can neither set up a king, nor puthim down.   

{6:35} In like manner, they can neither give riches nor money:though a man make a vow unto them, and keep it not, they will notrequire it.   

{6:36} They can save no man from death, neither deliver the weakfrom the mighty.   

{6:37} They cannot restore a blind man to his sight, nor help anyman in his distress.   

{6:38} They can shew no mercy to the widow, nor do good to thefatherless.   

{6:39} Their gods of wood, and which are overlaid with gold andsilver, are like the stones that be hewn out of the mountain: they thatworship them shall be confounded.   

{6:40} How should a man then think and say that they are gods, wheneven the Chaldeans themselves dishonour them?   

{6:41} Who if they shall see one dumb that cannot speak, they bringhim, and intreat Bel that he may speak, as though he were able tounderstand.   

{6:42} Yet they cannot understand this themselves, and leave them:for they have no knowledge.   

{6:43} The women also with cords about them, sitting in the ways,burn bran for perfume: but if any of them, drawn by some that passethby, lie with him, she reproacheth her fellow, that she was not thoughtas worthy as herself, nor her cord broken.   

{6:44} Whatsoever is done among them is false: how may it then bethought or said that they are gods?   

{6:45} They are made of carpenters and goldsmiths: they can benothing else than the workmen will have them to be.   

{6:46} And they themselves that made them can never continue long;how should then the things that are made of them be gods?   

{6:47} For they left lies and reproaches to them that come after.   

{6:48} For when there cometh any war or plague upon them, thepriests consult with themselves, where they may be hidden with them.   

{6:49} How then cannot men perceive that they be no gods, which canneither save themselves from war, nor from plague?   

{6:50} For seeing they be but of wood, and overlaid with silver andgold, it shall be known hereafter that they are false:   

{6:51} And it shall manifestly appear to all nations and kings thatthey are no gods, but the works of men's hands, and that there is nowork of God in them.   

{6:52} Who then may not know that they are no gods?   

{6:53} For neither can they set up a king in the land, nor give rainunto men.   

{6:54} Neither can they judge their own cause, nor redress a wrong,being unable: for they are as crows between heaven and earth.   

{6:55} Whereupon when fire falleth upon the house of gods of wood,or laid over with gold or silver, their priests will flee away, andescape; but they themselves shall be burned asunder like beams.   

{6:56} Moreover they cannot withstand any king or enemies: how canit then be thought or said that they be gods?   

{6:57} Neither are those gods of wood, and laid over with silver orgold, able to escape either from thieves or robbers.   

{6:58} Whose gold, and silver, and garments wherewith they areclothed, they that are strong take, and go away withal: neither arethey able to help themselves.   

{6:59} Therefore it is better to be a king that sheweth his power,or else a profitable vessel in an house, which the owner shall have useof, than such false gods; or to be a door in an house, to keep suchthings therein, than such false gods. or a pillar of wood in a apalace, than such false gods.   

{6:60} For sun, moon, and stars, being bright and sent to do theiroffices, are obedient.   

{6:61} In like manner the lightning when it breaketh forth is easyto be seen; and after the same manner the wind bloweth in every country.   

{6:62} And when God commandeth the clouds to go over the wholeworld, they do as they are bidden.   

{6:63} And the fire sent from above to consume hills and woods doethas it is commanded: but these are like unto them neither in shew norpower.   

{6:64} Wherefore it is neither to be supposed nor said that they aregods, seeing, they are able neither to judge causes, nor to do goodunto men.   

{6:65} Knowing therefore that they are no gods, fear them not,   

{6:66} For they can neither curse nor bless kings:   

{6:67} Neither can they shew signs in the heavens among the heathen,nor shine as the sun, nor give light as the moon.   

{6:68} The beasts are better than they: for they can get under acover and help themselves.   

{6:69} It is then by no means manifest unto us that they are gods:therefore fear them not.   

{6:70} For as a scarecrow in a garden of cucumbers keepeth nothing:so are their gods of wood, and laid over with silver and gold.   

{6:71} And likewise their gods of wood, and laid over with silverand gold, are like to a white thorn in an orchard, that every birdsitteth upon; as also to a dead body, that is east into the dark.   

{6:72} And ye shall know them to be no gods by the bright purplethat rotteth upon then1: and they themselves afterward shall be eaten,and shall be a reproach in the country.   

{6:73} Better therefore is the just man that hath none idols: for heshall be far from reproach.The Prayer of Azariah   

{1:1} And they walked in the midst of the fire, praising God, andblessing the Lord.   

{1:2} Then Azarias stood up, and prayed on this manner; and openinghis mouth in the midst of the fire said,   

{1:3} Blessed art thou, O Lord God of our fathers: thy name isworthy to be praised and glorified for evermore:   

{1:4} For thou art righteous in all the things that thou hast doneto us: yea, true are all thy works, thy ways are right, and all thyjudgments truth.   

{1:5} In all the things that thou hast brought upon us, and upon theholy city of our fathers, even Jerusalem, thou hast executed truejudgment: for according to truth and judgment didst thou bring allthese things upon us because of our sins.   

{1:6} For we have sinned and committed iniquity, departing from thee.   

{1:7} In all things have we trespassed, and not obeyed thycommandments, nor kept them, neither done as thou hast commanded us,that it might go well with us.   

{1:8} Wherefore all that thou hast brought upon us, and every thingthat thou hast done to us, thou hast done in true judgment.   

{1:9} And thou didst deliver us into the hands of lawless enemies,most hateful forsakers of God, and to an unjust king, and the mostwicked in all the world.   

{1:10} And now we cannot open our mouths, we are become a shame andreproach to thy servants; and to them that worship thee.   

{1:11} Yet deliver us not up wholly, for thy name's sake, neitherdisannul thou thy covenant:   

{1:12} And cause not thy mercy to depart from us, for thy belovedAbraham's sake, for thy servant Issac's sake, and for thy holy Israel'ssake;   

{1:13} To whom thou hast spoken and promised, that thou wouldestmultiply their seed as the stars of heaven, and as the sand that liethupon the seashore.   

{1:14} For we, O Lord, are become less than any nation, and be keptunder this day in all the world because of our sins.   

{1:15} Neither is there at this time prince, or prophet, or leader,or burnt offering, or sacrifice, or oblation, or incense, or place tosacrifice before thee, and to find mercy.   

{1:16} Nevertheless in a contrite heart and an humble spirit let usbe accepted.   

{1:17} Like as in the burnt offerings of rams and bullocks, and likeas in ten thousands of fat lambs: so let our sacrifice be in thy sightthis day, and grant that we may wholly go after thee: for they shallnot be confounded that put their trust in thee.   

{1:18} And now we follow thee with all our heart, we fear thee, andseek thy face.   

{1:19} Put us not to shame: but deal with us after thylovingkindness, and according to the multitude of thy mercies.   

{1:20} Deliver us also according to thy marvellous works, and giveglory to thy name, O Lord: and let all them that do thy servants hurtbe ashamed;   

{1:21} And let them be confounded in all their power and might, andlet their strength be broken;   

{1:22} And let them know that thou art God, the only God, andglorious over the whole world.   

{1:23} And the king's servants, that put them in, ceased not to makethe oven hot with rosin, pitch, tow, and small wood;   

{1:24} So that the flame streamed forth above the furnace forty andnine cubits.   

{1:25} And it passed through, and burned those Chaldeans it foundabout the furnace.   

{1:26} But the angel of the Lord came down into the oven togetherwith Azarias and his fellows, and smote the flame of the fire out ofthe oven;   

{1:27} And made the midst of the furnace as it had been a moistwhistling wind, so that the fire touched them not at all, neither hurtnor troubled them.   

{1:28} Then the three, as out of one mouth, praised, glorified, andblessed, God in the furnace, saying,   

{1:29} Blessed art thou, O Lord God of our fathers: and to bepraised and exalted above all for ever.   

{1:30} And blessed is thy glorious and holy name: and to be praisedand exalted above all for ever.   

{1:31} Blessed art thou in the temple of thine holy glory: and to bepraised and glorified above all for ever.   

{1:32} Blessed art thou that beholdest the depths, and sittest uponthe cherubims: and to be praised and exalted above all for ever.   

{1:33} Blessed art thou on the glorious throne of thy kingdom: andto be praised and glorified above all for ever.   

{1:34} Blessed art thou in the firmament of heaven: and above all tobe praised and glorified for ever.

{1:52} O let the earth bless the Lord: praise and exalt him aboveall for ever.   

{1:53} O ye mountains and little hills, bless ye the Lord: praiseand exalt him above all for ever.

{1:66} O Ananias, Azarias, and Misael, bless ye the Lord: praise andexalt him above all for ever: far he hath delivered us from hell, andsaved us from the hand of death, and delivered us out of the midst ofthe furnace and burning flame: even out of the midst of the fire hathhe delivered us.   

{1:67} O give thanks unto the Lord, because he is gracious: for hismercy endureth for ever.   

{1:68} O all ye that worship the Lord, bless the God of gods, praisehim, and give him thanks: for his mercy endureth for ever.The History of Susanna [in Daniel]   Set apart from the beginning of Daniel, because it is not in theHebrew, as neither the Narration of Bel and the Dragon.   

{1:1} There dwelt a man in Babylon, called Joacim:   

{1:2} And he took a wife, whose name was Susanna, the daughter ofChelcias, a very fair woman, and one that feared the Lord.   

{1:3} Her parents also were righteous, and taught their daughteraccording to the law of Moses.   

{1:4} Now Joacim was a great rich man, and had a fair garden joiningunto his house: and to him resorted the Jews; because he was morehonourable than all others.   

{1:5} The same year were appointed two of the ancients of the peopleto be judges, such as the Lord spake of, that wickedness came fromBabylon from ancient judges, who seemed to govern the people.   

{1:6} These kept much at Joacim's house: and all that had any suitsin law came unto them.   

{1:7} Now when the people departed away at noon, Susanna went intoher husband's garden to walk.   

{1:8} And the two elders saw her going in every day, and walking; sothat their lust was inflamed toward her.   

{1:9} And they perverted their own mind, and turned away their eyes,that they might not look unto heaven, nor remember just judgments.   

{1:10} And albeit they both were wounded with her love, yet durstnot one shew another his grief.   

{1:11} For they were ashamed to declare their lust, that theydesired to have to do with her.   

{1:12} Yet they watched diligently from day to day to see her.   

{1:13} And the one said to the other, Let us now go home: for it isdinner time.   

{1:14} So when they were gone out, they parted the one from theother, and turning back again they came to the same place; and afterthat they had asked one another the cause, they acknowledged theirlust: then appointed they a time both together, when they might findher alone.   

{1:15} And it fell out, as they watched a fit time, she went in asbefore with two maids only, and she was desirous to wash herself in thegarden: for it was hot.   

{1:16} And there was no body there save the two elders, that had hidthemselves, and watched her.   

{1:17} Then she said to her maids, Bring me oil and washing balls,and shut the garden doors, that I may wash me.   

{1:18} And they did as she bade them, and shut the garden doors, andwent out themselves at privy doors to fetch the things that she hadcommanded them: but they saw not the elders, because they were hid.   

{1:19} Now when the maids were gone forth, the two elders rose up,and ran unto her, saying,   

{1:20} Behold, the garden doors are shut, that no man can see us,and we are in love with thee; therefore consent unto us, and lie withus.   

{1:21} If thou wilt not, we will bear witness against thee, that ayoung man was with thee: and therefore thou didst send away thy maidsfrom thee.   

{1:22} Then Susanna sighed, and said, I am straitened on every side:for if I do this thing, it is death unto me: and if I do it not Icannot escape your hands.   

{1:23} It is better for me to fall into your hands, and not do it,than to sin in the sight of the Lord.   

{1:24} With that Susanna cried with a loud voice: and the two elderscried out against her.   

{1:25} Then ran the one, and opened the garden door.   

{1:26} So when the servants of the house heard the cry in thegarden, they rushed in at the privy door, to see what was done unto her.   

{1:27} But when the elders had declared their matter, the servantswere greatly ashamed: for there was never such a report made of Susanna.   

{1:28} And it came to pass the next day, when the people wereassembled to her husband Joacim, the two elders came also full ofmischievous imagination against Susanna to put her to death;   

{1:29} And said before the people, Send for Susanna, the daughter ofChelcias, Joacim's wife. And so they sent.   

{1:30} So she came with her father and mother, her children, and allher kindred.   

{1:31} Now Susanna was a very delicate woman, and beauteous tobehold.   

{1:32} And these wicked men commanded to uncover her face, (for shewas covered) that they might be filled with her beauty.   

{1:33} Therefore her friends and all that saw her wept.   

{1:34} Then the two elders stood up in the midst of the people, andlaid their hands upon her head.   

{1:35} And she weeping looked up toward heaven: for her hearttrusted in the Lord.   

{1:36} And the elders said, As we walked in the garden alone, thiswoman came in with two maids, and shut the garden doors, and sent themaids away.   

{1:37} Then a young man, who there was hid, came unto her, and laywith her.   

{1:38} Then we that stood in a corner of the garden, seeing thiswickedness, ran unto them.   

{1:39} And when we saw them together, the man we could not hold: forhe was stronger than we, and opened the door, and leaped out.   

{1:40} But having taken this woman, we asked who the young man was,but she would not tell us: these things do we testify.   

{1:41} Then the assembly believed them as those that were the eldersand judges of the people: so they condemned her to death.   

{1:42} Then Susanna cried out with a loud voice, and said, Oeverlasting God, that knowest the secrets, and knowest all thingsbefore they be:   

{1:43} Thou knowest that they have borne false witness against me,and, behold, I must die; whereas I never did such things as these menhave maliciously invented against me.   

{1:44} And the Lord heard her voice.   

{1:45} Therefore when she was led to be put to death, the Lordraised up the holy spirit of a young youth whose name was Daniel:   

{1:46} Who cried with a loud voice, I am clear from the blood ofthis woman.   

{1:47} Then all the people turned them toward him, and said, Whatmean these words that thou hast spoken?   

{1:48} So he standing in the midst of them said, Are ye such fools,ye sons of Israel, that without examination or knowledge of the truthye have condemned a daughter of Israel?   

{1:49} Return again to the place of judgment: for they have bornefalse witness against her.   

{1:50} Wherefore all the people turned again in haste, and theelders said unto him, Come, sit down among us, and shew it us, seeingGod hath given thee the honour of an elder.   

{1:51} Then said Daniel unto them, Put these two aside one far fromanother, and I will examine them.   

{1:52} So when they were put asunder one from another, he called oneof them, and said unto him, O thou that art waxen old in wickedness,now thy sins which thou hast committed aforetime are come to light.   

{1:53} For thou hast pronounced false judgment and hast condemnedthe innocent and hast let the guilty go free; albeit the Lord saith,The innocent and righteous shalt thou not slay.   

{1:54} Now then, if thou hast seen her, tell me, Under what treesawest thou them companying together? Who answered, Under a masticktree.   

{1:55} And Daniel said, Very well; thou hast lied against thine ownhead; for even now the angel of God hath received the sentence of Godto cut thee in two.   

{1:56} So he put him aside, and commanded to bring the other, andsaid unto him, O thou seed of Chanaan, and not of Juda, beauty hathdeceived thee, and lust hath perverted thine heart.   

{1:57} Thus have ye dealt with the daughters of Israel, and they forfear companied with you: but the daughter of Juda would not abide yourwickedness.   

{1:58} Now therefore tell me, Under what tree didst thou take themcompanying together? Who answered, Under an holm tree.   

{1:59} Then said Daniel unto him, Well; thou hast also lied againstthine own head: for the angel of God waiteth with the sword to cut theein two, that he may destroy you.   

{1:60} With that all the assembly cried out with a loud voice, andpraised God, who saveth them that trust in him.   

{1:61} And they arose against the two elders, for Daniel hadconvicted them of false witness by their own mouth:   

{1:62} And according to the law of Moses they did unto them in suchsort as they maliciously intended to do to their neighbour: and theyput them to death. Thus the innocent blood was saved the same day.   

{1:63} Therefore Chelcias and his wife praised God for theirdaughter Susanna, with Joacim her husband, and all the kindred, becausethere was no dishonesty found in her.   

{1:64} From that day forth was Daniel had in great reputation in thesight of the people.The Book of Bel and the Dragon [in Daniel]   The History of the Destruction of Bel and the Dragon, Cut off fromthe end of Daniel.   

{1:1} And king Astyages was gathered to his fathers, and Cyrus ofPersia received his kingdom.   

{1:2} And Daniel conversed with the king, and was honoured above allhis friends.   

{1:3} Now the Babylons had an idol, called Bel, and there were spentupon him every day twelve great measures of fine flour, and fortysheep, and six vessels of wine.   

{1:4} And the king worshipped it and went daily to adore it: butDaniel worshipped his own God. And the king said unto him, Why dost notthou worship Bel?   

{1:5} Who answered and said, Because I may not worship idols madewith hands, but the living God, who hath created the heaven and theearth, and hath sovereignty over all flesh.   

{1:6} Then said the king unto him, Thinkest thou not that Bel is aliving God? seest thou not how much he eateth and drinketh every day?   

{1:7} Then Daniel smiled, and said, O king, be not deceived: forthis is but clay within, and brass without, and did never eat or drinkany thing.   

{1:8} So the king was wroth, and called for his priests, and saidunto them, If ye tell me not who this is that devoureth these expences,ye shall die.   

{1:9} But if ye can certify me that Bel devoureth them, then Danielshall die: for he hath spoken blasphemy against Bel. And Daniel saidunto the king, Let it be according to thy word.   

{1:10} Now the priests of Bel were threescore and ten, beside theirwives and children. And the king went with Daniel into the temple ofBel.   

{1:11} So Bel's priests said, Lo, we go out: but thou, O king, seton the meat, and make ready the wine, and shut the door fast and sealit with thine own signet;   

{1:12} And to morrow when thou comest in, if thou findest not thatBel hath eaten up all, we will suffer death: or else Daniel, thatspeaketh falsely against us.   

{1:13} And they little regarded it: for under the table they hadmade a privy entrance, whereby they entered in continually, andconsumed those things.   

{1:14} So when they were gone forth, the king set meats before Bel.Now Daniel had commanded his servants to bring ashes, and those theystrewed throughout all the temple in the presence of the king alone:then went they out, and shut the door, and sealed it with the king'ssignet, and so departed.   

{1:15} Now in the night came the priests with their wives andchildren, as they were wont to do, and did eat and drink up all.   

{1:16} In the morning betime the king arose, and Daniel with him.   

{1:17} And the king said, Daniel, are the seals whole? And he said,Yea, O king, they be whole.   

{1:18} And as soon as he had opened the dour, the king looked uponthe table, and cried with a loud voice, Great art thou, O Bel, and withthee is no deceit at all.   

{1:19} Then laughed Daniel, and held the king that he should not goin, and said, Behold now the pavement, and mark well whose footstepsare these.   

{1:20} And the king said, I see the footsteps of men, women, andchildren. And then the king was angry,   

{1:21} And took the priests with their wives and children, whoshewed him the privy doors, where they came in, and consumed suchthings as were upon the table.   

{1:22} Therefore the king slew them, and delivered Bel into Daniel'spower, who destroyed him and his temple.   

{1:23} And in that same place there was a great dragon, which theyof Babylon worshipped.   

{1:24} And the king said unto Daniel, Wilt thou also say that thisis of brass? lo, he liveth, he eateth and drinketh; thou canst not saythat he is no living god: therefore worship him.   

{1:25} Then said Daniel unto the king, I will worship the Lord myGod: for he is the living God.   

{1:26} But give me leave, O king, and I shall slay this dragonwithout sword or staff. The king said, I give thee leave.   

{1:27} Then Daniel took pitch, and fat, and hair, and did seethethem together, and made lumps thereof: this he put in the dragon'smouth, and so the dragon burst in sunder : and Daniel said, Lo, theseare the gods ye worship.   

{1:28} When they of Babylon heard that, they took great indignation,and conspired against the king, saying, The king is become a Jew, andhe hath destroyed Bel, he hath slain the dragon, and put the priests todeath.   

{1:29} So they came to the king, and said, Deliver us Daniel, orelse we will destroy thee and thine house.   

{1:30} Now when the king saw that they pressed him sore, beingconstrained, he delivered Daniel unto them:   

{1:31} Who cast him into the lions' den: where he was six days.   

{1:32} And in the den there were seven lions, and they had giventhem every day two carcases, and two sheep: which then were not givento them, to the intent they might devour Daniel.   

{1:33} Now there was in Jewry a prophet, called Habbacuc, who hadmade pottage, and had broken bread in a bowl, and was going into thefield, for to bring it to the reapers.   

{1:34} But the angel of the Lord said unto Habbacuc, Go, carry thedinner that thou hast into Babylon unto Daniel, who is in the lions'den.   

{1:35} And Habbacuc said, Lord, I never saw Babylon; neither do Iknow where the den is.   

{1:36} Then the angel of the Lord took him by the crown, and barehim by the hair of his head, and through the vehemency of his spiritset him in Babylon over the den.   

{1:37} And Habbacuc cried, saying, O Daniel, Daniel, take the dinnerwhich God hath sent thee.   

{1:38} And Daniel said, Thou hast remembered me, O God: neither hastthou forsaken them that seek thee and love thee.   

{1:39} So Daniel arose, and did eat: and the angel of the Lord setHabbacuc in his own place again immediately.   

{1:40} Upon the seventh day the king went to bewail Daniel: and whenhe came to the den, he looked in, and behold, Daniel was sitting.   

{1:41} Then cried the king with a loud voice, saying, Great art LordGod of Daniel, and there is none other beside thee.   

{1:42} And he drew him out, and cast those that were the cause ofhis destruction into the den: and they were devoured in a moment beforehis face.The First Book of the Maccabees   

{1:1} And it happened, after that Alexander son of Philip, theMacedonian, who came out of the land of Chettiim, had smitten Dariusking of the Persians and Medes, that he reigned in his stead, the firstover Greece,   

{1:2} And made many wars, and won many strong holds, and slew thekings of the earth,   

{1:3} And went through to the ends of the earth, and took spoils ofmany nations, insomuch that the earth was quiet before him; whereuponhe was exalted and his heart was lifted up.   

{1:4} And he gathered a mighty strong host and ruled over countries,and nations, and kings, who became tributaries unto him.   

{1:5} And after these things he fell sick, and perceived that heshould die.   

{1:6} Wherefore he called his servants, such as were honourable, andhad been brought up with him from his youth, and parted his kingdomamong them, while he was yet alive.   

{1:7} So Alexander reigned twelves years, and then died.   

{1:8} And his servants bare rule every one in his place.   

{1:9} And after his death they all put crowns upon themselves; sodid their sons after them many years: and evils were multiplied in theearth.   

{1:10} And there came out of them a wicked root Antiochus surnamedEpiphanes, son of Antiochus the king, who had been an hostage at Rome,and he reigned in the hundred and thirty and seventh year of thekingdom of the Greeks.   

{1:11} In those days went there out of Israel wicked men, whopersuaded many, saying, Let us go and make a covenant with the heathenthat are round about us: for since we departed from them we have hadmuch sorrow.   

{1:12} So this device pleased them well.   

{1:13} Then certain of the people were so forward herein, that theywent to the king, who gave them licence to do after the ordinances ofthe heathen:   

{1:14} Whereupon they built a place of exercise at Jerusalemaccording to the customs of the heathen:   

{1:15} And made themselves uncircumcised, and forsook the holycovenant, and joined themselves to the heathen, and were sold to domischief.   

{1:16} Now when the kingdom was established before Antiochus, hethought to reign over Egypt that he might have the dominion of tworealms.   

{1:17} Wherefore he entered into Egypt with a great multitude, withchariots, and elephants, and horsemen, and a great navy,   

{1:18} And made war against Ptolemee king of Egypt: but Ptolemee wasafraid of him, and fled; and many were wounded to death.   

{1:19} Thus they got the strong cities in the land of Egypt and hetook the spoils thereof.   

{1:20} And after that Antiochus had smitten Egypt, he returned againin the hundred forty and third year, and went up against Israel andJerusalem with a great multitude,   

{1:21} And entered proudly into the sanctuary, and took away thegolden altar, and the candlestick of light, and all the vessels thereof,   

{1:22} And the table of the shewbread, and the pouring vessels, andthe vials. and the censers of gold, and the veil, and the crown, andthe golden ornaments that were before the temple, all which he pulledoff.   

{1:23} He took also the silver and the gold, and the preciousvessels: also he took the hidden treasures which he found.   

{1:24} And when he had taken all away, he went into his own land,having made a great massacre, and spoken very proudly.   

{1:25} Therefore there was a great mourning in Israel, in everyplace where they were;   

{1:26} So that the princes and elders mourned, the virgins and youngmen were made feeble, and the beauty of women was changed.   

{1:27} Every bridegroom took up lamentation, and she that sat in themarriage chamber was in heaviness,   

{1:28} The land also was moved for the inhabitants thereof, and allthe house of Jacob was covered with confusion.   

{1:29} And after two years fully expired the king sent his chiefcollector of tribute unto the cities of Juda, who came unto Jerusalemwith a great multitude,   

{1:30} And spake peaceable words unto them, but all was deceit: forwhen they had given him credence, he fell suddenly upon the city, andsmote it very sore, and destroyed much people of Israel.   

{1:31} And when he had taken the spoils of the city, he set it onfire, and pulled down the houses and walls thereof on every side.   

{1:32} But the women and children took they captive, and possessedthe cattle.   

{1:33} Then builded they the city of David with a great and strongwall, and with mighty towers, and made it a strong hold for them.   

{1:34} And they put therein a sinful nation, wicked men, andfortified themselves therein.   

{1:35} They stored it also with armour and victuals, and when theyhad gathered together the spoils of Jerusalem, they laid them up there,and so they became a sore snare:   

{1:36} For it was a place to lie in wait against the sanctuary, andan evil adversary to Israel.   

{1:37} Thus they shed innocent blood on every side of the sanctuary,and defiled it:   

{1:38} Insomuch that the inhabitants of Jerusalem fled because ofthem: whereupon the city was made an habitation of strangers, andbecame strange to those that were born in her; and her own childrenleft her.   

{1:39} Her sanctuary was laid waste like a wilderness, her feastswere turned into mourning, her sabbaths into reproach her honour intocontempt.   

{1:40} As had been her glory, so was her dishonour increased, andher excellency was turned into mourning.   

{1:41} Moreover king Antiochus wrote to his whole kingdom, that allshould be one people,   

{1:42} And every one should leave his laws: so all the heathenagreed according to the commandment of the king.   

{1:43} Yea, many also of the Israelites consented to his religion,and sacrificed unto idols, and profaned the sabbath.   

{1:44} For the king had sent letters by messengers unto Jerusalemand the cities of Juda that they should follow the strange laws of theland,   

{1:45} And forbid burnt offerings, and sacrifice, and drinkofferings, in the temple; and that they should profane the sabbaths andfestival days:   

{1:46} And pollute the sanctuary and holy people:   

{1:47} Set up altars, and groves, and chapels of idols, andsacrifice swine's flesh, and unclean beasts:   

{1:48} That they should also leave their children uncircumcised, andmake their souls abominable with all manner of uncleanness andprofanation:   

{1:49} To the end they might forget the law, and change all theordinances.   

{1:50} And whosoever would not do according to the commandment ofthe king, he said, he should die.   

{1:51} In the selfsame manner wrote he to his whole kingdom, andappointed overseers over all the people, commanding the cities of Judato sacrifice, city by city.   

{1:52} Then many of the people were gathered unto them, to wit everyone that forsook the law; and so they committed evils in the land;   

{1:53} And drove the Israelites into secret places, even wheresoeverthey could flee for succour.   

{1:54} Now the fifteenth day of the month Casleu, in the hundredforty and fifth year, they set up the abomination of desolation uponthe altar, and builded idol altars throughout the cities of Juda onevery side;   

{1:55} And burnt incense at the doors of their houses, and in thestreets.   

{1:56} And when they had rent in pieces the books of the law whichthey found, they burnt them with fire.   

{1:57} And whosoever was found with any the book of the testament,or if any committed to the law, the king's commandment was, that theyshould put him to death.   

{1:58} Thus did they by their authority unto the Israelites everymonth, to as many as were found in the cities.   

{1:59} Now the five and twentieth day of the month they didsacrifice upon the idol altar, which was upon the altar of God.   

{1:60} At which time according to the commandment they put to deathcertain women, that had caused their children to be circumcised.   

{1:61} And they hanged the infants about their necks, and rifledtheir houses, and slew them that had circumcised them.   

{1:62} Howbeit many in Israel were fully resolved and confirmed inthemselves not to eat any unclean thing.   

{1:63} Wherefore the rather to die, that they might not be defiledwith meats, and that they might not profane the holy covenant: so thenthey died.   

{1:64} And there was very great wrath upon Israel.   

{2:1} In those days arose Mattathias the son of John, the son ofSimeon, a priest of the sons of Joarib, from Jerusalem, and dwelt inModin.   

{2:2} And he had five sons, Joannan, called Caddis:   

{2:3} Simon; called Thassi:   

{2:4} Judas, who was called Maccabeus:   

{2:5} Eleazar, called Avaran: and Jonathan, whose surname was Apphus.   

{2:6} And when he saw the blasphemies that were committed in Judaand Jerusalem,   

{2:7} He said, Woe is me! wherefore was I born to see this misery ofmy people, and of the holy city, and to dwell there, when it wasdelivered into the hand of the enemy, and the sanctuary into the handof strangers?   

{2:8} Her temple is become as a man without glory.   

{2:9} Her glorious vessels are carried away into captivity, herinfants are slain in the streets, her young men with the sword of theenemy.   

{2:10} What nation hath not had a part in her kingdom and gotten ofher spoils?   

{2:11} All her ornaments are taken away; of a free woman she isbecome a bondslave.   

{2:12} And, behold, our sanctuary, even our beauty and our glory, islaid waste, and the Gentiles have profaned it.   

{2:13} To what end therefore shall we live any longer?   

{2:14} Then Mattathias and his sons rent their clothes, and put onsackcloth, and mourned very sore.   

{2:15} In the mean while the king's officers, such as compelled thepeople to revolt, came into the city Modin, to make them sacrifice.   

{2:16} And when many of Israel came unto them, Mattathias also andhis sons came together.   

{2:17} Then answered the king's officers, and said to Mattathias onthis wise, Thou art a ruler, and an honourable and great man in thiscity, and strengthened with sons and brethren:   

{2:18} Now therefore come thou first, and fulfil the king'scommandment, like as all the heathen have done, yea, and the men ofJuda also, and such as remain at Jerusalem: so shalt thou and thy housebe in the number of the king's friends, and thou and thy children shallbe honoured with silver and gold, and many rewards.   

{2:19} Then Mattathias answered and spake with a loud voice, Thoughall the nations that are under the king's dominion obey him, and fallaway every one from the religion of their fathers, and give consent tohis commandments:   

{2:20} Yet will I and my sons and my brethren walk in the covenantof our fathers.   

{2:21} God forbid that we should forsake the law and the ordinances.   

{2:22} We will not hearken to the king's words, to go from ourreligion, either on the right hand, or the left.   

{2:23} Now when he had left speaking these words, there came one ofthe Jews in the sight of all to sacrifice on the altar which was atModin, according to the king's commandment.   

{2:24} Which thing when Mattathias saw, he was inflamed with zeal,and his reins trembled, neither could he forbear to shew his angeraccording to judgment: wherefore he ran, and slew him upon the altar.   

{2:25} Also the king's commissioner, who compelled men to sacrifice,he killed at that time, and the altar he pulled down.   

{2:26} Thus dealt he zealously for the law of God like as Phineesdid unto Zambri the son of Salom.   

{2:27} And Mattathias cried throughout the city with a loud voice,saying, Whosoever is zealous of the law, and maintaineth the covenant,let him follow me.   

{2:28} So he and his sons fled into the mountains, and left all thatever they had in the city.   

{2:29} Then many that sought after justice and judgment went downinto the wilderness, to dwell there:   

{2:30} Both they, and their children, and their wives; and theircattle; because afflictions increased sore upon them.   

{2:31} Now when it was told the king's servants, and the host thatwas at Jerusalem, in the city of David, that certain men, who hadbroken the king's commandment, were gone down into the secret places inthe wilderness,   

{2:32} They pursued after them a great number, and having overtakenthem, they camped against them, and made war against them on thesabbath day.   

{2:33} And they said unto them, Let that which ye have done hithertosuffice; come forth, and do according to the commandment of the king,and ye shall live.   

{2:34} But they said, We will not come forth, neither will we do theking's commandment, to profane the sabbath day.   

{2:35} So then they gave them the battle with all speed.   

{2:36} Howbeit they answered them not, neither cast they a stone atthem, nor stopped the places where they lay hid;   

{2:37} But said, Let us die all in our innocency: heaven and earthwill testify for us, that ye put us to death wrongfully.   

{2:38} So they rose up against them in battle on the sabbath, andthey slew them, with their wives and children and their cattle, to thenumber of a thousand people.   

{2:39} Now when Mattathias and his friends understood hereof, theymourned for them right sore.   

{2:40} And one of them said to another, If we all do as our brethrenhave done, and fight not for our lives and laws against the heathen,they will now quickly root us out of the earth.   

{2:41} At that time therefore they decreed, saying, Whosoever shallcome to make battle with us on the sabbath day, we will fight againsthim; neither will we die all, as our brethren that were murdered im thesecret places.   

{2:42} Then came there unto him a company of Assideans who weremighty men of Israel, even all such as were voluntarily devoted untothe law.   

{2:43} Also all they that fled for persecution joined themselvesunto them, and were a stay unto them.   

{2:44} So they joined their forces, and smote sinful men in theiranger, and wicked men in their wrath: but the rest fled to the heathenfor succour.   

{2:45} Then Mattathias and his friends went round about, and pulleddown the altars:   

{2:46} And what children soever they found within the coast ofIsrael uncircumcised, those they circumcised valiantly.   

{2:47} They pursued also after the proud men, and the work prosperedin their hand.   

{2:48} So they recovered the law out of the hand of the Gentiles,and out of the hand of kings, neither suffered they the sinner totriumph.   

{2:49} Now when the time drew near that Mattathias should die, hesaid unto his sons, Now hath pride and rebuke gotten strength, and thetime of destruction, and the wrath of indignation:   

{2:50} Now therefore, my sons, be ye zealous for the law, and giveyour lives for the covenant of your fathers.   

{2:51} Call to remembrance what acts our fathers did in their time;so shall ye receive great honour and an everlasting name.   

{2:52} Was not Abraham found faithful in temptation, and it wasimputed unto him for righteousness?   

{2:53} Joseph in the time of his distress kept the commandment andwas made lord of Egypt.   

{2:54} Phinees our father in being zealous and fervent obtained thecovenant of an everlasting priesthood.   

{2:55} Jesus for fulfilling the word was made a judge in Israel.   

{2:56} Caleb for bearing witness before the congregation receivedthe heritage of the land.   

{2:57} David for being merciful possessed the throne of aneverlasting kingdom.   

{2:58} Elias for being zealous and fervent for the law was taken upinto heaven.   

{2:59} Ananias, Azarias, and Misael, by believing were saved out ofthe flame.   

{2:60} Daniel for his innocency was delivered from the mouth oflions.   

{2:61} And thus consider ye throughout all ages, that none that puttheir trust in him shall be overcome.   

{2:62} Fear not then the words of a sinful man: for his glory shallbe dung and worms.   

{2:63} To day he shall be lifted up and to morrow he shall not befound, because he is returned into his dust, and his thought is come tonothing.   

{2:64} Wherefore, ye my sons, be valiant and shew yourselves men inthe behalf of the law; for by it shall ye obtain glory.   

{2:65} And behold, I know that your brother Simon is a man ofcounsel, give ear unto him alway: he shall be a father unto you.   

{2:66} As for Judas Maccabeus, he hath been mighty and strong, evenfrom his youth up: let him be your captain, and fight the battle of thepeople.   

{2:67} Take also unto you all those that observe the law, and avengeye the wrong of your people.   

{2:68} Recompense fully the heathen, and take heed to thecommandments of the law.   

{2:69} So he blessed them, and was gathered to his fathers.   

{2:70} And he died in the hundred forty and sixth year, and his sonsburied him in the sepulchres of his fathers at Modin, and all Israelmade great lamentation for him.   

{3:1} Then his son Judas, called Maccabeus, rose up in his stead.   

{3:2} And all his brethren helped him, and so did all they that heldwith his father, and they fought with cheerfulness the battle of Israel.   

{3:3} So he gat his people great honour, and put on a breastplate asa giant, and girt his warlike harness about him, and he made battles,protecting the host with his sword.   

{3:4} In his acts he was like a lion, and like a lion's whelproaring for his prey.   

{3:5} For He pursued the wicked, and sought them out, and burnt upthose that vexed his people.   

{3:6} Wherefore the wicked shrunk for fear of him, and all theworkers of iniquity were troubled, because salvation prospered in hishand.   

{3:7} He grieved also many kings, and made Jacob glad with his acts,and his memorial is blessed for ever.   

{3:8} Moreover he went through the cities of Juda, destroying theungodly out of them, and turning away wrath from Israel:   

{3:9} So that he was renowned unto the utmost part of the earth, andhe received unto him such as were ready to perish.   

{3:10} Then Apollonius gathered the Gentiles together, and a greathost out of Samaria, to fight against Israel.   

{3:11} Which thing when Judas perceived, he went forth to meet him,and so he smote him, and slew him: many also fell down slain, but therest fled.   

{3:12} Wherefore Judas took their spoils, and Apollonius' swordalso, and therewith he fought all his life long.   

{3:13} Now when Seron, a prince of the army of Syria, heard say thatJudas had gathered unto him a multitude and company of the faithful togo out with him to war;   

{3:14} He said, I will get me a name and honour in the kingdom; forI will go fight with Judas and them that are with him, who despise theking's commandment.   

{3:15} So he made him ready to go up, and there went with him amighty host of the ungodly to help him, and to be avenged of thechildren of Israel.   

{3:16} And when he came near to the going up of Bethhoron, Judaswent forth to meet him with a small company:   

{3:17} Who, when they saw the host coming to meet them, said untoJudas, How shall we be able, being so few, to fight against so great amultitude and so strong, seeing we are ready to faint with fasting allthis day?   

{3:18} Unto whom Judas answered, It is no hard matter for many to beshut up in the hands of a few; and with the God of heaven it is allone, to deliver with a great multitude, or a small company:   

{3:19} For the victory of battle standeth not in the multitude of anhost; but strength cometh from heaven.   

{3:20} They come against us in much pride and iniquity to destroyus, and our wives and children, and to spoil us:   

{3:21} But we fight for our lives and our laws.   

{3:22} Wherefore the Lord himself will overthrow them before ourface: and as for you, be ye not afraid of them.   

{3:23} Now as soon as he had left off speaking, he leapt suddenlyupon them, and so Seron and his host was overthrown before him.   

{3:24} And they pursued them from the going down of Bethhoron untothe plain, where were slain about eight hundred men of them; and theresidue fled into the land of the Philistines.   

{3:25} Then began the fear of Judas and his brethren, and anexceeding great dread, to fall upon the nations round about them:   

{3:26} Insomuch as his fame came unto the king, and all nationstalked of the battles of Judas.   

{3:27} Now when king Antiochus heard these things, he was full ofindignation: wherefore he sent and gathered together all the forces ofhis realm, even a very strong army.   

{3:28} He opened also his treasure, and gave his soldiers pay for ayear, commanding them to be ready whensoever he should need them.   

{3:29} Nevertheless, when he saw that the money of his treasuresfailed and that the tributes in the country were small, because of thedissension and plague, which he had brought upon the land in takingaway the laws which had been of old time;   

{3:30} He feared that he should not be able to bear the charges anylonger, nor to have such gifts to give so liberally as he did before:for he had abounded above the kings that were before him.   

{3:31} Wherefore, being greatly perplexed in his mind, he determinedto go into Persia, there to take the tributes of the countries, and togather much money.   

{3:32} So he left Lysias, a nobleman, and one of the blood royal, tooversee the affairs of the king from the river Euphrates unto theborders of Egypt:   

{3:33} And to bring up his son Antiochus, until he came again.   

{3:34} Moreover he delivered unto him the half of his forces, andthe elephants, and gave him charge of all things that he would havedone, as also concerning them that dwelt in Juda and Jerusalem:   

{3:35} To wit, that he should send an army against them, to destroyand root out the strength of Israel, and the remnant of Jerusalem, andto take away their memorial from that place;   

{3:36} And that he should place strangers in all their quarters, anddivide their land by lot.   

{3:37} So the king took the half of the forces that remained, anddeparted from Antioch, his royal city, the hundred forty and seventhyear; and having passed the river Euphrates, he went through the highcountries.   

{3:38} Then Lysias chose Ptolemee the son of Dorymenes, Nicanor, andGorgias, mighty men of the king's friends:   

{3:39} And with them he sent forty thousand footmen, and seventhousand horsemen, to go into the land of Juda, and to destroy it, asthe king commanded.   

{3:40} So they went forth with all their power, and came and pitchedby Emmaus in the plain country.   

{3:41} And the merchants of the country, hearing the fame of them,took silver and gold very much, with servants, and came into the campto buy the children of Israel for slaves: a power also of Syria and ofthe land of the Philistines joined themselves unto them.   

{3:42} Now when Judas and his brethren saw that miseries weremultiplied, and that the forces did encamp themselves in their borders:for they knew how the king had given commandment to destroy the people,and utterly abolish them;   

{3:43} They said one to another, Let us restore the decayed fortuneof our people, and let us fight for our people and the sanctuary.   

{3:44} Then was the congregation gathered together, that they mightbe ready for battle, and that they might pray, and ask mercy andcompassion.   

{3:45} Now Jerusalem lay void as a wilderness, there was none of herchildren that went in or out: the sanctuary also was trodden down, andaliens kept the strong hold; the heathen had their habitation in thatplace; and joy was taken from Jacob, and the pipe with the harp ceased.   

{3:46} Wherefore the Israelites assembled themselves together, andcame to Maspha, over against Jerusalem; for in Maspha was the placewhere they prayed aforetime in Israel.   

{3:47} Then they fasted that day, and put on sackcloth, and castashes upon their heads, and rent their clothes,   

{3:48} And laid open the book of the law, wherein the heathen hadsought to paint the likeness of their images.   

{3:49} They brought also the priests' garments, and the firstfruits,and the tithes: and the Nazarites they stirred up, who had accomplishedtheir days.   

{3:50} Then cried they with a loud voice toward heaven, saying, Whatshall we do with these, and whither shall we carry them away?   

{3:51} For thy sanctuary is trodden down and profaned, and thypriests are in heaviness, and brought low.   

{3:52} And lo, the heathen are assembled together against us todestroy us: what things they imagine against us, thou knowest.   

{3:53} How shall we be able to stand against them, except thou, OGod, be our help?   

{3:54} Then sounded they with trumpets, and cried with a loud voice.   

{3:55} And after this Judas ordained captains over the people, evencaptains over thousands, and over hundreds, and over fifties, and overtens.   

{3:56} But as for such as were building houses, or had betrothedwives, or were planting vineyards, or were fearful, those he commandedthat they should return, every man to his own house, according to thelaw.   

{3:57} So the camp removed, and pitched upon the south side ofEmmaus.   

{3:58} And Judas said, arm yourselves, and be valiant men, and seethat ye be in readiness against the morning, that ye may fight withthese nations, that are assembled together against us to destroy us andour sanctuary:   

{3:59} For it is better for us to die in battle, than to behold thecalamities of our people and our sanctuary.   

{3:60} Nevertheless, as the will of God is in heaven, so let him do.   

{4:1} Then took Gorgias five thousand footmen, and a thousand of thebest horsemen, and removed out of the camp by night;   

{4:2} To the end he might rush in upon the camp of the Jews, andsmite them suddenly. And the men of the fortress were his guides.   

{4:3} Now when Judas heard thereof he himself removed, and thevaliant men with him, that he might smite the king's army which was atEmmaus,   

{4:4} While as yet the forces were dispersed from the camp.   

{4:5} In the mean season came Gorgias by night into the camp ofJudas: and when he found no man there, he sought them in the mountains:for said he, These fellows flee from us   

{4:6} But as soon as it was day, Judas shewed himself in the plainwith three thousand men, who nevertheless had neither armour nor swordsto their minds.   

{4:7} And they saw the camp of the heathen, that it was strong andwell harnessed, and compassed round about with horsemen; and these wereexpert of war.   

{4:8} Then said Judas to the men that were with him, Fear ye nottheir multitude, neither be ye afraid of their assault.   

{4:9} Remember how our fathers were delivered in the Red sea, whenPharaoh pursued them with an army.   

{4:10} Now therefore let us cry unto heaven, if peradventure theLord will have mercy upon us, and remember the covenant of our fathers,and destroy this host before our face this day:   

{4:11} That so all the heathen may know that there is one whodelivereth and saveth Israel.   

{4:12} Then the strangers lifted up their eyes, and saw them comingover against them.   

{4:13} Wherefore they went out of the camp to battle; but they thatwere with Judas sounded their trumpets.   

{4:14} So they joined battle, and the heathen being discomfited fledinto the plain.   

{4:15} Howbeit all the hindmost of them were slain with the sword:for they pursued them unto Gazera, and unto the plains of Idumea, andAzotus, and Jamnia, so that there were slain of them upon a threethousand men.   

{4:16} This done, Judas returned again with his host from pursuingthem,   

{4:17} And said to the people, Be not greedy of the spoil inasmuchas there is a battle before us,   

{4:18} And Gorgias and his host are here by us in the mountain: butstand ye now against our enemies, and overcome them, and after this yemay boldly take the spoils.   

{4:19} As Judas was yet speaking these words, there appeared a partof them looking out of the mountain:   

{4:20} Who when they perceived that the Jews had put their host toflight and were burning the tents; for the smoke that was seen declaredwhat was done:   

{4:21} When therefore they perceived these things, they were soreafraid, and seeing also the host of Judas in the plain ready to fight,   

{4:22} They fled every one into the land of strangers.   

{4:23} Then Judas returned to spoil the tents, where they got muchgold, and silver, and blue silk, and purple of the sea, and greatriches.   

{4:24} After this they went home, and sung a song of thanksgiving,and praised the Lord in heaven: because it is good, because his mercyendureth forever.   

{4:25} Thus Israel had a great deliverance that day.   

{4:26} Now all the strangers that had escaped came and told Lysiaswhat had happened:   

{4:27} Who, when he heard thereof, was confounded and discouraged,because neither such things as he would were done unto Israel, nor suchthings as the king commanded him were come to pass.   

{4:28} The next year therefore following Lysias gathered togetherthreescore thousand choice men of foot, and five thousand horsemen,that he might subdue them.   

{4:29} So they came into Idumea, and pitched their tents atBethsura, and Judas met them with ten thousand men.   

{4:30} And when he saw that mighty army, he prayed and said, Blessedart thou, O Saviour of Israel, who didst quell the violence of themighty man by the hand of thy servant David, and gavest the host ofstrangers into the hands of Jonathan the son of Saul, and hisarmourbearer;   

{4:31} Shut up this army in the hand of thy people Israel, and letthem be confounded in their power and horsemen:   

{4:32} Make them to be of no courage, and cause the boldness oftheir strength to fall away, and let them quake at their destruction:   

{4:33} Cast them down with the sword of them that love thee, and letall those that know thy name praise thee with thanksgiving.   

{4:34} So they joined battle; and there were slain of the host ofLysias about five thousand men, even before them were they slain.   

{4:35} Now when Lysias saw his army put to flight, and the manlinessof Judas' soldiers, and how they were ready either to live or dievaliantly, he went into Antiochia, and gathered together a company ofstrangers, and having made his army greater than it was, he purposed tocome again into Judea.   

{4:36} Then said Judas and his brethren, Behold, our enemies arediscomfited: let us go up to cleanse and dedicate the sanctuary.   

{4:37} Upon this all the host assembled themselves together, andwent up into mount Sion.   

{4:38} And when they saw the sanctuary desolate, and the altarprofaned, and the gates burned up, and shrubs growing in the courts asin a forest, or in one of the mountains, yea, and the priests' chamberspulled down;   

{4:39} They rent their clothes, and made great lamentation, and castashes upon their heads,   

{4:40} And fell down flat to the ground upon their faces, and blewan alarm with the trumpets, and cried toward heaven.   

{4:41} Then Judas appointed certain men to fight against those thatwere in the fortress, until he had cleansed the sanctuary.   

{4:42} So he chose priests of blameless conversation, such as hadpleasure in the law:   

{4:43} Who cleansed the sanctuary, and bare out the defiled stonesinto an unclean place.   

{4:44} And when as they consulted what to do with the altar of burntofferings, which was profaned;   

{4:45} They thought it best to pull it down, lest it should be areproach to them, because the heathen had defiled it: wherefore theypulled it down,   

{4:46} And laid up the stones in the mountain of the temple in aconvenient place, until there should come a prophet to shew what shouldbe done with them.   

{4:47} Then they took whole stones according to the law, and built anew altar according to the former;   

{4:48} And made up the sanctuary, and the things that were withinthe temple, and hallowed the courts.   

{4:49} They made also new holy vessels, and into the temple theybrought the candlestick, and the altar of burnt offerings, and ofincense, and the table.   

{4:50} And upon the altar they burned incense, and the lamps thatwere upon the candlestick they lighted, that they might give light inthe temple.   

{4:51} Furthermore they set the loaves upon the table, and spreadout the veils, and finished all the works which they had begun to make.   

{4:52} Now on the five and twentieth day of the ninth month, whichis called the month Casleu, in the hundred forty and eighth year, theyrose up betimes in the morning,   

{4:53} And offered sacrifice according to the law upon the new altarof burnt offerings, which they had made.   

{4:54} Look, at what time and what day the heathen had profaned it,even in that was it dedicated with songs, and citherns, and harps, andcymbals.   

{4:55} Then all the people fell upon their faces, worshipping andpraising the God of heaven, who had given them good success.   

{4:56} And so they kept the dedication of the altar eight days andoffered burnt offerings with gladness, and sacrificed the sacrifice ofdeliverance and praise.   

{4:57} They decked also the forefront of the temple with crowns ofgold, and with shields; and the gates and the chambers they renewed,and hanged doors upon them.   

{4:58} Thus was there very great gladness among the people, for thatthe reproach of the heathen was put away.   

{4:59} Moreover Judas and his brethren with the whole congregationof Israel ordained, that the days of the dedication of the altar shouldbe kept in their season from year to year by the space of eight days,from the five and twentieth day of the month Casleu, with mirth andgladness.   

{4:60} At that time also they builded up the mount Sion with highwalls and strong towers round about, lest the Gentiles should come andtread it down as they had done before.   

{4:61} And they set there a garrison to keep it, and fortifiedBethsura to preserve it; that the people might have a defence againstIdumea.   

{5:1} Now when the nations round about heard that the altar wasbuilt and the sanctuary renewed as before, it displeased them very much.   

{5:2} Wherefore they thought to destroy the generation of Jacob thatwas among them, and thereupon they began to slay and destroy the people.   

{5:3} Then Judas fought against the children of Esau in Idumea atArabattine, because they besieged Gael: and he gave them a greatoverthrow, and abated their courage, and took their spoils.   

{5:4} Also he remembered the injury of the children of Bean, who hadbeen a snare and an offence unto the people, in that they lay in waitfor them in the ways.   

{5:5} He shut them up therefore in the towers, and encamped againstthem, and destroyed them utterly, and burned the towers of that placewith fire, and all that were therein.   

{5:6} Afterward he passed over to the children of Ammon, where hefound a mighty power, and much people, with Timotheus their captain.   

{5:7} So he fought many battles with them, till at length they werediscomfited before him; and he smote them.   

{5:8} And when he had taken Jazar, with the towns belonging thereto,he returned into Judea.   

{5:9} Then the heathen that were at Galaad assembled themselvestogether against the Israelites that were in their quarters, to destroythem; but they fled to the fortress of Dathema.   

{5:10} And sent letters unto Judas and his brethren, The heathenthat are round about us are assembled together against us to destroy us:   

{5:11} And they are preparing to come and take the fortresswhereunto we are fled, Timotheus being captain of their host.   

{5:12} Come now therefore, and deliver us from their hands, for manyof us are slain:   

{5:13} Yea, all our brethren that were in the places of Tobie areput to death: their wives and their children also they have carriedaway captives, and borne away their stuff; and they have destroyedthere about a thousand men.   

{5:14} While these letters were yet reading, behold, there cameother messengers from Galilee with their clothes rent, who reported onthis wise,   

{5:15} And said, They of Ptolemais, and of Tyrus, and Sidon, and allGalilee of the Gentiles, are assembled together against us to consumeus.   

{5:16} Now when Judas and the people heard these words, thereassembled a great congregation together, to consult what they should dofor their brethren, that were in trouble, and assaulted of them.   

{5:17} Then said Judas unto Simon his brother, Choose thee out men,and go and deliver thy brethren that are in Galilee, for I and Jonathanmy brother will go into the country of Galaad.   

{5:18} So he left Joseph the son of Zacharias, and Azarias, captainsof the people, with the remnant of the host in Judea to keep it.   

{5:19} Unto whom he gave commandment, saying, Take ye the charge ofthis people, and see that ye make not war against the heathen until thetime that we come again.   

{5:20} Now unto Simon were given three thousand men to go intoGalilee, and unto Judas eight thousand men for the country of Galaad.   

{5:21} Then went Simon into Galilee, where he fought many battleswith the heathen, so that the heathen were discomfited by him.   

{5:22} And he pursued them unto the gate of Ptolemais; and therewere slain of the heathen about three thousand men, whose spoils hetook.   

{5:23} And those that were in Galilee, and in Arbattis, with theirwives and their children, and all that they had, took he away with him,and brought them into Judea with great joy.   

{5:24} Judas Maccabeus also and his brother Jonathan went overJordan, and travelled three days' journey in the wilderness,   

{5:25} Where they met with the Nabathites, who came unto them in apeaceable manner, and told them every thing that had happened to theirbrethren in the land of Galaad:   

{5:26} And how that many of them were shut up in Bosora, and Bosor,and Alema, Casphor, Maked, and Carnaim; all these cities are strong andgreat:   

{5:27} And that they were shut up in the rest of the cities of thecountry of Galaad, and that against to morrow they had appointed tobring their host against the forts, and to take them, and to destroythem all in one day.   

{5:28} Hereupon Judas and his host turned suddenly by the way of thewilderness unto Bosora; and when he had won the city, he slew all themales with the edge of the sword, and took all their spoils, and burnedthe city with fire,   

{5:29} From whence he removed by night, and went till he came to thefortress.   

{5:30} And betimes in the morning they looked up, and, behold, therewas an innumerable people bearing ladders and other engines of war, totake the fortress: for they assaulted them.   

{5:31} When Judas therefore saw that the battle was begun, and thatthe cry of the city went up to heaven, with trumpets, and a great sound,   

{5:32} He said unto his host, Fight this day for your brethren.   

{5:33} So he went forth behind them in three companies, who soundedtheir trumpets, and cried with prayer.   

{5:34} Then the host of Timotheus, knowing that it was Maccabeus,fled from him: wherefore he smote them with a great slaughter; so thatthere were killed of them that day about eight thousand men.   

{5:35} This done, Judas turned aside to Maspha; and after he hadassaulted it he took and slew all the males therein, and received thespoils thereof and and burnt it with fire.   

{5:36} From thence went he, and took Casphon, Maged, Bosor, and theother cities of the country of Galaad.   

{5:37} After these things gathered Timotheus another host andencamped against Raphon beyond the brook.   

{5:38} So Judas sent men to espy the host, who brought him word,saying, All the heathen that be round about us are assembled unto them,even a very great host.   

{5:39} He hath also hired the Arabians to help them and they havepitched their tents beyond the brook, ready to come and fight againstthee. Upon this Judas went to meet them.   

{5:40} Then Timotheus said unto the captains of his host, When Judasand his host come near the brook, if he pass over first unto us, weshall not be able to withstand him; for he will mightily prevailagainst us:   

{5:41} But if he be afraid, and camp beyond the river, we shall goover unto him, and prevail against him.   

{5:42} Now when Judas came near the brook, he caused the scribes ofthe people to remain by the brook: unto whom he gave commandment,saying, Suffer no man to remain in the camp, but let all come to thebattle.   

{5:43} So he went first over unto them, and all the people afterhim: then all the heathen, being discomfited before him, cast awaytheir weapons, and fled unto the temple that was at Carnaim.   

{5:44} But they took the city, and burned the temple with all thatwere therein. Thus was Carnaim subdued, neither could they stand anylonger before Judas.   

{5:45} Then Judas gathered together all the Israelites that were inthe country of Galaad, from the least unto the greatest, even theirwives, and their children, and their stuff, a very great host, to theend they might come into the land of Judea.   

{5:46} Now when they came unto Ephron, (this was a great city in theway as they should go, very well fortified) they could not turn fromit, either on the right hand or the left, but must needs pass throughthe midst of it.   

{5:47} Then they of the city shut them out, and stopped up the gateswith stones.   

{5:48} Whereupon Judas sent unto them in peaceable manner, saying,Let us pass through your land to go into our own country, and noneshall do you any hurt; we will only pass through on foot: howbeit theywould not open unto him.   

{5:49} Wherefore Judas commanded a proclamation to be madethroughout the host, that every man should pitch his tent in the placewhere he was.   

{5:50} So the soldiers pitched, and assaulted the city all that dayand all that night, till at the length the city was delivered into hishands:   

{5:51} Who then slew all the males with the edge of the sword, andrased the city, and took the spoils thereof, and passed through thecity over them that were slain.   

{5:52} After this went they over Jordan into the great plain beforeBethsan.   

{5:53} And Judas gathered together those that came behind, andexhorted the people all the way through, till they came into the landof Judea.   

{5:54} So they went up to mount Sion with joy and gladness, wherethey offered burnt offerings, because not one of them were slain untilthey had returned in peace.   

{5:55} Now what time as Judas and Jonathan were in the land ofGalaad, and Simon his brother in Galilee before Ptolemais,   

{5:56} Joseph the son of Zacharias, and Azarias, captains of thegarrisons, heard of the valiant acts and warlike deeds which they haddone.   

{5:57} Wherefore they said, Let us also get us a name, and go fightagainst the heathen that are round about us.   

{5:58} So when they had given charge unto the garrison that was withthem, they went toward Jamnia.   

{5:59} Then came Gorgias and his men out of the city to fightagainst them.   

{5:60} And so it was, that Joseph and Azaras were put to flight, andpursued unto the borders of Judea: and there were slain that day of thepeople of Israel about two thousand men.   

{5:61} Thus was there a great overthrow among the children ofIsrael, because they were not obedient unto Judas and his brethren, butthought to do some valiant act.   

{5:62} Moreover these men came not of the seed of those, by whosehand deliverance was given unto Israel.   

{5:63} Howbeit the man Judas and his brethren were greatly renownedin the sight of all Israel, and of all the heathen, wheresoever theirname was heard of;   

{5:64} Insomuch as the the people assembled unto them with joyfulacclamations.   

{5:65} Afterward went Judas forth with his brethren, and foughtagainst the children of Esau in the land toward the south, where hesmote Hebron, and the towns thereof, and pulled down the fortress ofit, and burned the towers thereof round about.   

{5:66} From thence he removed to go into the land of thePhilistines, and passed through Samaria.   

{5:67} At that time certain priests, desirous to shew their valour,were slain in battle, for that they went out to fight unadvisedly.   

{5:68} So Judas turned to Azotus in the land of the Philistines, andwhen he had pulled down their altars, and burned their carved imageswith fire, and spoiled their cities, he returned into the land of Judea.   

{6:1} About that time king Antiochus travelling through the highcountries heard say, that Elymais in the country of Persia was a citygreatly renowned for riches, silver, and gold;   

{6:2} And that there was in it a very rich temple, wherein werecoverings of gold, and breastplates, and shields, which Alexander, sonof Philip, the Macedonian king, who reigned first among the Grecians,had left there.   

{6:3} Wherefore he came and sought to take the city, and to spoilit; but he was not able, because they of the city, having had warningthereof,   

{6:4} Rose up against him in battle: so he fled, and departed thencewith great heaviness, and returned to Babylon.   

{6:5} Moreover there came one who brought him tidings into Persia,that the armies, which went against the land of Judea, were put toflight:   

{6:6} And that Lysias, who went forth first with a great power wasdriven away of the Jews; and that they were made strong by the armour,and power, and store of spoils, which they had gotten of the armies,whom they had destroyed:   

{6:7} Also that they had pulled down the abomination, which he hadset up upon the altar in Jerusalem, and that they had compassed aboutthe sanctuary with high walls, as before, and his city Bethsura.   

{6:8} Now when the king heard these words, he was astonished andsore moved: whereupon he laid him down upon his bed, and fell sick forgrief, because it had not befallen him as he looked for.   

{6:9} And there he continued many days: for his grief was ever moreand more, and he made account that he should die.   

{6:10} Wherefore he called for all his friends, and said unto them,The sleep is gone from mine eyes, and my heart faileth for very care.   

{6:11} And I thought with myself, Into what tribulation am I come,and how great a flood of misery is it, wherein now I am! for I wasbountiful and beloved in my power.   

{6:12} But now I remember the evils that I did at Jerusalem, andthat I took all the vessels of gold and silver that were therein, andsent to destroy the inhabitants of Judea without a cause.   

{6:13} I perceive therefore that for this cause these troubles arecome upon me, and, behold, I perish through great grief in a strangeland.   

{6:14} Then called he for Philip, one of his friends, who he maderuler over all his realm,   

{6:15} And gave him the crown, and his robe, and his signet, to theend he should bring up his son Antiochus, and nourish him up for thekingdom.   

{6:16} So king Antiochus died there in the hundred forty and ninthyear.   

{6:17} Now when Lysias knew that the king was dead, he set upAntiochus his son, whom he had brought up being young, to reign in hisstead, and his name he called Eupator.   

{6:18} About this time they that were in the tower shut up theIsraelites round about the sanctuary, and sought always their hurt, andthe strengthening of the heathen.   

{6:19} Wherefore Judas, purposing to destroy them, called all thepeople together to besiege them.   

{6:20} So they came together, and besieged them in the hundred andfiftieth year, and he made mounts for shot against them, and otherengines.   

{6:21} Howbeit certain of them that were besieged got forth, untowhom some ungodly men of Israel joined themselves:   

{6:22} And they went unto the king, and said, How long will it beere thou execute judgment, and avenge our brethren?   

{6:23} We have been willing to serve thy father, and to do as hewould have us, and to obey his commandments;   

{6:24} For which cause they of our nation besiege the tower, and arealienated from us: moreover as many of us as they could light on theyslew, and spoiled our inheritance.   

{6:25} Neither have they stretched out their hand against us only,but also against their borders.   

{6:26} And, behold, this day are they besieging the tower atJerusalem, to take it: the sanctuary also and Bethsura have theyfortified.   

{6:27} Wherefore if thou dost not prevent them quickly, they will dothe greater things than these, neither shalt thou be able to rule them.   

{6:28} Now when the king heard this, he was angry, and gatheredtogether all his friends, and the captains of his army, and those thathad charge of the horse.   

{6:29} There came also unto him from other kingdoms, and from islesof the sea, bands of hired soldiers.   

{6:30} So that the number of his army was an hundred thousandfootmen, and twenty thousand horsemen, and two and thirty elephantsexercised in battle.   

{6:31} These went through Idumea, and pitched against Bethsura,which they assaulted many days, making engines of war; but they ofBethsura came out, and burned them with fire, and fought valiantly.   

{6:32} Upon this Judas removed from the tower, and pitched inBathzacharias, over against the king's camp.   

{6:33} Then the king rising very early marched fiercely with hishost toward Bathzacharias, where his armies made them ready to battle,and sounded the trumpets.   

{6:34} And to the end they might provoke the elephants to fight,they shewed them the blood of grapes and mulberries.   

{6:35} Moreover they divided the beasts among the armies, and forevery elephant they appointed a thousand men, armed with coats of mail,and with helmets of brass on their heads; and beside this, for everybeast were ordained five hundred horsemen of the best.   

{6:36} These were ready at every occasion: wheresoever the beastwas, and whithersoever the beast went, they went also, neither departedthey from him.   

{6:37} And upon the beasts were there strong towers of wood, whichcovered every one of them, and were girt fast unto them with devices:there were also upon every one two and thirty strong men, that foughtupon them, beside the Indian that ruled him.   

{6:38} As for the remnant of the horsemen, they set them on thisside and that side at the two parts of the host giving them signs whatto do, and being harnessed all over amidst the ranks.   

{6:39} Now when the sun shone upon the shields of gold and brass,the mountains glistered therewith, and shined like lamps of fire.   

{6:40} So part of the king's army being spread upon the highmountains, and part on the valleys below, they marched on safely and inorder.   

{6:41} Wherefore all that heard the noise of their multitude, andthe marching of the company, and the rattling of the harness, weremoved: for the army was very great and mighty.   

{6:42} Then Judas and his host drew near, and entered into battle,and there were slain of the king's army six hundred men.   

{6:43} Eleazar also, surnamed Savaran, perceiving that one of thebeasts, armed with royal harness, was higher than all the rest, andsupposing that the king was upon him,   

{6:44} Put himself in jeopardy, to the end he might deliver hispeople, and get him a perpetual name:   

{6:45} Wherefore he ran upon him courageously through the midst ofthe battle, slaying on the right hand and on the left, so that theywere divided from him on both sides.   

{6:46} Which done, he crept under the elephant, and thrust himunder, and slew him: whereupon the elephant fell down upon him, andthere he died.   

{6:47} Howbeit the rest of the Jews seeing the strength of the king,and the violence of his forces, turned away from them.   

{6:48} Then the king's army went up to Jerusalem to meet them, andthe king pitched his tents against Judea, and against mount Sion.   

{6:49} But with them that were in Bethsura he made peace: for theycame out of the city, because they had no victuals there to endure thesiege, it being a year of rest to the land.   

{6:50} So the king took Bethsura, and set a garrison there to keepit.   

{6:51} As for the sanctuary, he besieged it many days: and set thereartillery with engines and instruments to cast fire and stones, andpieces to cast darts and slings.   

{6:52} Whereupon they also made engines against their engines, andheld them battle a long season.   

{6:53} Yet at the last, their vessels being without victuals, (forthat it was the seventh year, and they in Judea that were deliveredfrom the Gentiles, had eaten up the residue of the store;)   

{6:54} There were but a few left in the sanctuary, because thefamine did so prevail against them, that they were fain to dispersethemselves, every man to his own place.   

{6:55} At that time Lysias heard say, that Philip, whom Antiochusthe king, whiles he lived, had appointed to bring up his son Antiochus,that he might be king,   

{6:56} Was returned out of Persia and Media, and the king's hostalso that went with him, and that he sought to take unto him the rulingof the affairs.   

{6:57} Wherefore he went in all haste, and said to the king and thecaptains of the host and the company, We decay daily, and our victualsare but small, and the place we lay siege unto is strong, and theaffairs of the kingdom lie upon us:   

{6:58} Now therefore let us be friends with these men, and makepeace with them, and with all their nation;   

{6:59} And covenant with them, that they shall live after theirlaws, as they did before: for they are therefore displeased, and havedone all these things, because we abolished their laws.   

{6:60} So the king and the princes were content: wherefore he sentunto them to make peace; and they accepted thereof.   

{6:61} Also the king and the princes made an oath unto them:whereupon they went out of the strong hold.   

{6:62} Then the king entered into mount Sion; but when he saw thestrength of the place, he broke his oath that he had made, and gavecommandment to pull down the wall round about.   

{6:63} Afterward departed he in all haste, and returned untoAntiochia, where he found Philip to be master of the city: so he foughtagainst him, and took the city by force.   

{7:1} In the hundred and one and fiftieth year Demetrius the son ofSeleucus departed from Rome, and came up with a few men unto a city ofthe sea coast, and reigned there.   

{7:2} And as he entered into the palace of his ancestors, so it was,that his forces had taken Antiochus and Lysias, to bring them unto him.   

{7:3} Wherefore, when he knew it, he said, Let me not see theirfaces.   

{7:4} So his host slew them. Now when Demetrius was set upon thethrone of his kingdom,   

{7:5} There came unto him all the wicked and ungodly men of Israel,having Alcimus, who was desirous to be high priest, for their captain:   

{7:6} And they accused the people to the king, saying, Judas and hisbrethren have slain all thy friends, and driven us out of our own land.   

{7:7} Now therefore send some man whom thou trustest, and let him goand see what havock he hath made among us, and in the king's land, andlet him punish them with all them that aid them.   

{7:8} Then the king chose Bacchides, a friend of the king, who ruledbeyond the flood, and was a great man in the kingdom, and faithful tothe king,   

{7:9} And him he sent with that wicked Alcimus, whom he made highpriest, and commanded that he should take vengeance of the children ofIsrael.   

{7:10} So they departed, and came with a great power into the landof Judea, where they sent messengers to Judas and his brethren withpeaceable words deceitfully.   

{7:11} But they gave no heed to their words; for they saw that theywere come with a great power.   

{7:12} Then did there assemble unto Alcimus and Bacchides a companyof scribes, to require justice.   

{7:13} Now the Assideans were the first among the children of Israelthat sought peace of them:   

{7:14} For said they, One that is a priest of the seed of Aaron iscome with this army, and he will do us no wrong.   

{7:15} So he spake unto them, peaceably, and sware unto them,saying, we will procure the harm neither of you nor your friends.   

{7:16} Whereupon they believed him: howbeit he took of themthreescore men, and slew them in one day, according to the words whichhe wrote,   

{7:17} The flesh of thy saints have they cast out, and their bloodhave they shed round about Jerusalem, and there was none to bury them.   

{7:18} Wherefore the fear and dread of them fell upon all thepeople, who said, There is neither truth nor righteousness in them; forthey have broken the covenant and oath that they made.   

{7:19} After this, removed Bacchides from Jerusalem, and pitched histents in Bezeth, where he sent and took many of the men that hadforsaken him, and certain of the people also, and when he had slainthem, he cast them into the great pit.   

{7:20} Then committed he the country to Alcimus, and left with him apower to aid him: so Bacchides went to the king.   

{7:21} But Alcimus contended for the high priesthood.   

{7:22} And unto him resorted all such as troubled the people, who,after they had gotten the land of Juda into their power, did much hurtin Israel.   

{7:23} Now when Judas saw all the mischief that Alcimus and hiscompany had done among the Israelites, even above the heathen,   

{7:24} He went out into all the coasts of Judea round about, andtook vengeance of them that had revolted from him, so that they durstno more go forth into the country.   

{7:25} On the other side, when Alcimus saw that Judas and hiscompany had gotten the upper hand, and knew that he was not able toabide their force, he went again to the king, and said all the worst ofthem that he could.   

{7:26} Then the king sent Nicanor, one of his honourable princes, aman that bare deadly hate unto Israel, with commandment to destroy thepeople.   

{7:27} So Nicanor came to Jerusalem with a great force; and sentunto Judas and his brethren deceitfully with friendly words, saying,   

{7:28} Let there be no battle between me and you; I will come with afew men, that I may see you in peace.   

{7:29} He came therefore to Judas, and they saluted one anotherpeaceably. Howbeit the enemies were prepared to take away Judas byviolence.   

{7:30} Which thing after it was known to Judas, to wit, that he cameunto him with deceit, he was sore afraid of him, and would see his faceno more.   

{7:31} Nicanor also, when he saw that his counsel was discovered,went out to fight against Judas beside Capharsalama:   

{7:32} Where there were slain of Nicanor's side about five thousandmen, and the rest fled into the city of David.   

{7:33} After this went Nicanor up to mount Sion, and there came outof the sanctuary certain of the priests and certain of the elders ofthe people, to salute him peaceably, and to shew him the burntsacrifice that was offered for the king.   

{7:34} But he mocked them, and laughed at them, and abused themshamefully, and spake proudly,   

{7:35} And sware in his wrath, saying, Unless Judas and his host benow delivered into my hands, if ever I come again in safety, I willburn up this house: and with that he went out in a great rage.   

{7:36} Then the priests entered in, and stood before the altar andthe temple, weeping, and saying,   

{7:37} Thou, O Lord, didst choose this house to be called by thyname, and to be a house of prayer and petition for thy people:   

{7:38} Be avenged of this man and his host, and let them fall by thesword: remember their blasphemies, and suffer them not to continue anylonger.   

{7:39} So Nicanor went out of Jerusalem, and pitched his tents inBethhoron, where an host out of Syria met him.   

{7:40} But Judas pitched in Adasa with three thousand men, and therehe prayed, saying,   

{7:41} O Lord, when they that were sent from the king of theAssyrians blasphemed, thine angel went out, and smote an hundredfourscore and five thousand of them.   

{7:42} Even so destroy thou this host before us this day, that therest may know that he hath spoken blasphemously against thy sanctuary,and judge thou him according to his wickedness.   

{7:43} So the thirteenth day of the month Adar the hosts joinedbattle: but Nicanor's host was discomfited, and he himself was firstslain in the battle.   

{7:44} Now when Nicanor's host saw that he was slain, they cast awaytheir weapons, and fled.   

{7:45} Then they pursued after them a day's journey, from Adasa untoGazera, sounding an alarm after them with their trumpets.   

{7:46} Whereupon they came forth out of all the towns of Judea roundabout, and closed them in; so that they, turning back upon them thatpursued them, were all slain with the sword, and not one of them wasleft.   

{7:47} Afterwards they took the spoils, and the prey, and smote offNicanors head, and his right hand, which he stretched out so proudly,and brought them away, and hanged them up toward Jerusalem.   

{7:48} For this cause the people rejoiced greatly, and they keptthat day a day of great gladness.   

{7:49} Moreover they ordained to keep yearly this day, being thethirteenth of Adar.   

{7:50} Thus the land of Juda was in rest a little while.   

{8:1} Now Judas had heard of the the Romans, that they were mightyand valiant men, and such as would lovingly accept all that joinedthemselves unto them, and make a league of amity with all that cameunto them;   

{8:2} And that they were men of great valour. It was told him alsoof their wars and noble acts which they had done among the Galatians,and how they had conquered them, and brought them under tribute;   

{8:3} And what they had done in the country of Spain, for thewinning of the mines of the silver and gold which is there;   

{8:4} And that by their policy and patience they had conquered allthe place, though it were very far from them; and the kings also thatcame against them from the uttermost part of the earth, till they haddiscomfited them, and given them a great overthrow, so that the restdid give them tribute every year:   

{8:5} Beside this, how they had discomfited in battle Philip, andPerseus, king of the Citims, with others that lifted up themselvesagainst them, and had overcome them:   

{8:6} How also Antiochus the great king of Asia, that came againstthem in battle, having an hundred and twenty elephants, with horsemen,and chariots, and a very great army, was discomfited by them;   

{8:7} And how they took him alive, and covenanted that he and suchas reigned after him should pay a great tribute, and give hostages, andthat which was agreed upon,   

{8:8} And the country of India, and Media and Lydia and of thegoodliest countries, which they took of him, and gave to king Eumenes:   

{8:9} Moreover how the Grecians had determined to come and destroythem;   

{8:10} And that they, having knowledge thereof sent against them acertain captain, and fighting with them slew many of them, and carriedaway captives their wives and their children, and spoiled them, andtook possession of their lands, and pulled down their strong holds, andbrought them to be their servants unto this day:   

{8:11} It was told him besides, how they destroyed and brought undertheir dominion all other kingdoms and isles that at any time resistedthem;   

{8:12} But with their friends and such as relied upon them they keptamity: and that they had conquered kingdoms both far and nigh, insomuchas all that heard of their name were afraid of them:   

{8:13} Also that, whom they would help to a kingdom, those reign;and whom again they would, they displace: finally, that they weregreatly exalted:   

{8:14} Yet for all this none of them wore a crown or was clothed inpurple, to be magnified thereby:   

{8:15} Moreover how they had made for themselves a senate house,wherein three hundred and twenty men sat in council daily, consultingalway for the people, to the end they might be well ordered:   

{8:16} And that they committed their government to one man everyyear, who ruled over all their country, and that all were obedient tothat one, and that there was neither envy nor emmulation among them.   

{8:17} In consideration of these things, Judas chose Eupolemus theson of John, the son of Accos, and Jason the son of Eleazar, and sentthem to Rome, to make a league of amity and confederacy with them,   

{8:18} And to intreat them that they would take the yoke from them;for they saw that the kingdom of the Grecians did oppress Israel withservitude.   

{8:19} They went therefore to Rome, which was a very great journey,and came into the senate, where they spake and said.   

{8:20} Judas Maccabeus with his brethren, and the people of theJews, have sent us unto you, to make a confederacy and peace with you,and that we might be registered your confederates and friends.   

{8:21} So that matter pleased the Romans well.   

{8:22} And this is the copy of the epistle which the senate wroteback again in tables of brass, and sent to Jerusalem, that there theymight have by them a memorial of peace and confederacy:   

{8:23} Good success be to the Romans, and to the people of the Jews,by sea and by land for ever: the sword also and enemy be far from them,   

{8:24} If there come first any war upon the Romans or any of theirconfederates throughout all their dominion,   

{8:25} The people of the Jews shall help them, as the time shall beappointed, with all their heart:   

{8:26} Neither shall they give any thing unto them that make warupon them, or aid them with victuals, weapons, money, or ships, as ithath seemed good unto the Romans; but they shall keep their covenantswithout taking any thing therefore.   

{8:27} In the same manner also, if war come first upon the nation ofthe Jews, the Romans shall help them with all their heart, according asthe time shall be appointed them:   

{8:28} Neither shall victuals be given to them that take partagainst them, or weapons, or money, or ships, as it hath seemed good tothe Romans; but they shall keep their covenants, and that withoutdeceit.   

{8:29} According to these articles did the Romans make a covenantwith the people of the Jews.   

{8:30} Howbeit if hereafter the one party or the other shall thinkto meet to add or diminish any thing, they may do it at theirpleasures, and whatsoever they shall add or take away shall be ratified.   

{8:31} And as touching the evils that Demetrius doeth to the Jews,we have written unto him, saying, Wherefore thou made thy yoke heavyupon our friends and confederates the Jews?   

{8:32} If therefore they complain any more against thee, we will dothem justice, and fight with thee by sea and by land.   

{9:1} Furthermore, when Demetrius heard the Nicanor and his hostwere slain in battle, he sent Bacchides and Alcimus into the land ofJudea the second time, and with them the chief strength of his host:   

{9:2} Who went forth by the way that leadeth to Galgala, and pitchedtheir tents before Masaloth, which is in Arbela, and after they had wonit, they slew much people.   

{9:3} Also the first month of the hundred fifty and second year theyencamped before Jerusalem:   

{9:4} From whence they removed, and went to Berea, with twentythousand footmen and two thousand horsemen.   

{9:5} Now Judas had pitched his tents at Eleasa, and three thousandchosen men with him:   

{9:6} Who seeing the multitude of the other army to he so great weresore afraid; whereupon many conveyed themselves out of the host,insomuch as abode of them no more but eight hundred men.   

{9:7} When Judas therefore saw that his host slipt away, and thatthe battle pressed upon him, he was sore troubled in mind, and muchdistressed, for that he had no time to gather them together.   

{9:8} Nevertheless unto them that remained he said, Let us arise andgo up against our enemies, if peradventure we may be able to fight withthem.   

{9:9} But they dehorted him, saying, We shall never be able: let usnow rather save our lives, and hereafter we will return with ourbrethren, and fight against them: for we are but few.   

{9:10} Then Judas said, God forbid that I should do this thing, andflee away from them: if our time be come, let us die manfully for ourbrethren, and let us not stain our honour.   

{9:11} With that the host of Bacchides removed out of their tents,and stood over against them, their horsemen being divided into twotroops, and their slingers and archers going before the host and theythat marched in the foreward were all mighty men.   

{9:12} As for Bacchides, he was in the right wing: so the host drewnear on the two parts, and sounded their trumpets.   

{9:13} They also of Judas' side, even they sounded their trumpetsalso, so that the earth shook at the noise of the armies, and thebattle continued from morning till night.   

{9:14} Now when Judas perceived that Bacchides and the strength ofhis army were on the right side, he took with him all the hardy men,   

{9:15} Who discomfited the right wing, and pursued them unto themount Azotus.   

{9:16} But when they of the left wing saw that they of the rightwing were discomfited, they followed upon Judas and those that werewith him hard at the heels from behind:   

{9:17} Whereupon there was a sore battle, insomuch as many wereslain on both parts.   

{9:18} Judas also was killed, and the remnant fled.   

{9:19} THen Jonathan and Simon took Judas their brother, and buriedhim in the sepulchre of his fathers in Modin.   

{9:20} Moreover they bewailed him, and all Israel made greatlamentation for him, and mourned many days, saying,   

{9:21} How is the valiant man fallen, that delivered Israel!   

{9:22} As for the other things concerning Judas and his wars, andthe noble acts which he did, and his greatness, they are not written:for they were very many.   

{9:23} Now after the death of Judas the wicked began to put forththeir heads in all the coasts of Israel, and there arose up all such aswrought iniquity.   

{9:24} In those days also was there a very great famine, by reasonwhereof the country revolted, and went with them.   

{9:25} Then Bacchides chose the wicked men, and made them lords ofthe country.   

{9:26} And they made enquiry and search for Judas' friends, andbrought them unto Bacchides, who took vengeance of them, and used themdespitefully.   

{9:27} So was there a great affliction in Israel, the like whereofwas not since the time that a prophet was not seen among them.   

{9:28} For this cause all Judas' friends came together, and saidunto Jonathan,   

{9:29} Since thy brother Judas died, we have no man like him to goforth against our enemies, and Bacchides, and against them of ournation that are adversaries to us.   

{9:30} Now therefore we have chosen thee this day to be our princeand captain in his stead, that thou mayest fight our battles.   

{9:31} Upon this Jonathan took the governance upon him at that time,and rose up instead of his brother Judas.   

{9:32} But when Bacchides gat knowledge thereof, he sought for toslay him   

{9:33} Then Jonathan, and Simon his brother, and all that were withhim, perceiving that, fled into the wilderness of Thecoe, and pitchedtheir tents by the water of the pool Asphar.   

{9:34} Which when Bacchides understood, he came near to Jordan withall his host upon the sabbath day.   

{9:35} Now Jonathan had sent his brother John, a captain of thepeople, to pray his friends the Nabathites, that they might leave withthem their carriage, which was much.   

{9:36} But the children of Jambri came out of Medaba, and took John,and all that he had, and went their way with it.   

{9:37} After this came word to Jonathan and Simon his brother, thatthe children of Jambri made a great marriage, and were bringing thebride from Nadabatha with a great train, as being the daughter of oneof the great princes of Chanaan.   

{9:38} Therefore they remembered John their brother, and went up,and hid themselves under the covert of the mountain:   

{9:39} Where they lifted up their eyes, and looked, and, behold,there was much ado and great carriage: and the bridegroom came forth,and his friends and brethren, to meet them with drums, and instrumentsof musick, and many weapons.   

{9:40} Then Jonathan and they that were with him rose up againstthem from the place where they lay in ambush, and made a slaughter ofthem in such sort, as many fell down dead, and the remnant fled intothe mountain, and they took all their spoils.   

{9:41} Thus was the marriage turned into mourning, and the noise oftheir melody into lamentation.   

{9:42} So when they had avenged fully the blood of their brother,they turned again to the marsh of Jordan.   

{9:43} Now when Bacchides heard hereof, he came on the sabbath dayunto the banks of Jordan with a great power.   

{9:44} Then Jonathan said to his company, Let us go up now and fightfor our lives, for it standeth not with us to day, as in time past:   

{9:45} For, behold, the battle is before us and behind us, and thewater of Jordan on this side and that side, the marsh likewise andwood, neither is there place for us to turn aside.   

{9:46} Wherefore cry ye now unto heaven, that ye may be deliveredfrom the hand of your enemies.   

{9:47} With that they joined battle, and Jonathan stretched forthhis hand to smite Bacchides, but he turned back from him.   

{9:48} Then Jonathan and they that were with him leapt into Jordan,and swam over unto the other bank: howbeit the other passed not overJordan unto them.   

{9:49} So there were slain of Bacchides' side that day about athousand men.   

{9:50} Afterward returned Bacchides to Jerusalem and repaired thestrong cites in Judea; the fort in Jericho, and Emmaus, and Bethhoron,and Bethel, and Thamnatha, Pharathoni, and Taphon, these did hestrengthen with high walls, with gates and with bars.   

{9:51} And in them he set a garrison, that they might work maliceupon Israel.   

{9:52} He fortified also the city Bethsura, and Gazera, and thetower, and put forces in them, and provision of victuals.   

{9:53} Besides, he took the chief men's sons in the country forhostages, and put them into the tower at Jerusalem to be kept.   

{9:54} Moreover in the hundred fifty and third year, in the secondmonth, Alcimus commanded that the wall of the inner court of thesanctuary should be pulled down; he pulled down also the works of theprophets   

{9:55} And as he began to pull down, even at that time was Alcimusplagued, and his enterprizes hindered: for his mouth was stopped, andhe was taken with a palsy, so that he could no more speak any thing,nor give order concerning his house.   

{9:56} So Alcimus died at that time with great torment.   

{9:57} Now when Bacchides saw that Alcimus was dead, he returned tothe king: whereupon the land of Judea was in rest two years.   

{9:58} Then all the ungodly men held a council, saying, Behold,Jonathan and his company are at ease, and dwell without care: nowtherefore we will bring Bacchides hither, who shall take them all inone night.   

{9:59} So they went and consulted with him.   

{9:60} Then removed he, and came with a great host, and sent lettersprivily to his adherents in Judea, that they should take Jonathan andthose that were with him: howbeit they could not, because their counselwas known unto them.   

{9:61} Wherefore they took of the men of the country, that wereauthors of that mischief, about fifty persons, and slew them.   

{9:62} Afterward Jonathan, and Simon, and they that were with him,got them away to Bethbasi, which is in the wilderness, and theyrepaired the decays thereof, and made it strong.   

{9:63} Which thing when Bacchides knew, he gathered together all hishost, and sent word to them that were of Judea.   

{9:64} Then went he and laid siege against Bethbasi; and they foughtagainst it a long season and made engines of war.   

{9:65} But Jonathan left his brother Simon in the city, and wentforth himself into the country, and with a certain number went he forth.   

{9:66} And he smote Odonarkes and his brethren, and the children ofPhasiron in their tent.   

{9:67} And when he began to smite them, and came up with his forces,Simon and his company went out of the city, and burned up the enginesof war,   

{9:68} And fought against Bacchides, who was discomfited by them,and they afflicted him sore: for his counsel and travail was in vain.   

{9:69} Wherefore he was very wroth at the wicked men that gave himcounsel to come into the country, inasmuch as he slew many of them, andpurposed to return into his own country.   

{9:70} Whereof when Jonathan had knowledge, he sent ambassadors untohim, to the end he should make peace with him, and deliver them theprisoners.   

{9:71} Which thing he accepted, and did according to his demands,and sware unto him that he would never do him harm all the days of hislife.   

{9:72} When therefore he had restored unto him the prisoners that hehad taken aforetime out of the land of Judea, he returned and went hisway into his own land, neither came he any more into their borders.   

{9:73} Thus the sword ceased from Israel: but Jonathan dwelt atMachmas, and began to govern the people; and he destroyed the ungodlymen out of Israel.   

{10:1} In the hundred and sixtieth year Alexander, the son ofAntiochus surnamed Epiphanes, went up and took Ptolemais: for thepeople had received him, by means whereof he reigned there,   

{10:2} Now when king Demetrius heard thereof, he gathered togetheran exceeding great host, and went forth against him to fight.   

{10:3} Moreover Demetrius sent letters unto Jonathan with lovingwords, so as he magnified him.   

{10:4} For said he, Let us first make peace with him, before he joinwith Alexander against us:   

{10:5} Else he will remember all the evils that we have done againsthim, and against his brethren and his people.   

{10:6} Wherefore he gave him authority to gather together an host,and to provide weapons, that he might aid him in battle: he commandedalso that the hostages that were in the tower should be delivered him.   

{10:7} Then came Jonathan to Jerusalem, and read the letters in theaudience of all the people, and of them that were in the tower:   

{10:8} Who were sore afraid, when they heard that the king had givenhim authority to gather together an host.   

{10:9} Whereupon they of the tower delivered their hostages untoJonathan, and he delivered them unto their parents.   

{10:10} This done, Jonathan settled himself in Jerusalem, and beganto build and repair the city.   

{10:11} And he commanded the workmen to build the walls and themount Sion and about with square stones for fortification; and they didso.   

{10:12} Then the strangers, that were in the fortresses whichBacchides had built, fled away;   

{10:13} Insomuch as every man left his place, and went into his owncountry.   

{10:14} Only at Bethsura certain of those that had forsaken the lawand the commandments remained still: for it was their place of refuge.   

{10:15} Now when king Alexander had heard what promises Demetriushad sent unto Jonathan: when also it was told him of the battles andnoble acts which he and his brethren had done, and of the pains thatthey had endured,   

{10:16} He said, Shall we find such another man? now therefore wewill make him our friend and confederate.   

{10:17} Upon this he wrote a letter, and sent it unto him, accordingto these words, saying,   

{10:18} King Alexander to his brother Jonathan sendeth greeting:   

{10:19} We have heard of thee, that thou art a man of great power,and meet to be our friend.   

{10:20} Wherefore now this day we ordain thee to be the high priestof thy nation, and to be called the king's friend; (and therewithal hesent him a purple robe and a crown of gold:) and require thee to takeour part, and keep friendship with us.   

{10:21} So in the seventh month of the hundred and sixtieth year, atthe feast of the tabernacles, Jonathan put on the holy robe, andgathered together forces, and provided much armour.   

{10:22} Whereof when Demetrius heard, he was very sorry, and said,   

{10:23} What have we done, that Alexander hath prevented us inmaking amity with the Jews to strengthen himself?   

{10:24} I also will write unto them words of encouragement, andpromise them dignities and gifts, that I may have their aid.   

{10:25} He sent unto them therefore to this effect: King Demetriusunto the people of the Jews sendeth greeting:   

{10:26} Whereas ye have kept covenants with us, and continued in ourfriendship, not joining yourselves with our enemies, we have heardhereof, and are glad.   

{10:27} Wherefore now continue ye still to be faithful unto us, andwe will well recompense you for the things ye do in our behalf,   

{10:28} And will grant you many immunities, and give you rewards.   

{10:29} And now do I free you, and for your sake I release all theJews, from tributes, and from the customs of salt, and from crown taxes,   

{10:30} And from that which appertaineth unto me to receive for thethird part or the seed, and the half of the fruit of the trees, Irelease it from this day forth, so that they shall not be taken of theland of Judea, nor of the three governments which are added thereuntoout of the country of Samaria and Galilee, from this day forth forevermore.   

{10:31} Let Jerusalem also be holy and free, with the bordersthereof, both from tenths and tributes.   

{10:32} And as for the tower which is at Jerusalem, I yield upauthority over it, and give the high priest, that he may set in it suchmen as he shall choose to keep it.   

{10:33} Moreover I freely set at liberty every one of the Jews, thatwere carried captives out of the land of Judea into any part of mykingdom, and I will that all my officers remit the tributes even oftheir cattle.   

{10:34} Furthermore I will that all the feasts, and sabbaths, andnew moons, and solemn days, and the three days before the feast, andthe three days after the feast shall be all of immunity and freedom forall the Jews in my realm.   

{10:35} Also no man shall have authority to meddle with or to molestany of them in any matter.   

{10:36} I will further, that there be enrolled among the king'sforces about thirty thousand men of the Jews, unto whom pay shall begiven, as belongeth to all king's forces.   

{10:37} And of them some shall be placed in the king's strong holds,of whom also some shall be set over the affairs of the kingdom, whichare of trust: and I will that their overseers and governors be ofthemselves, and that they live after their own laws, even as the kinghath commanded in the land of Judea.   

{10:38} And concerning the three governments that are added to Judeafrom the country of Samaria, let them be joined with Judea, that theymay be reckoned to be under one, nor bound to obey other authority thanthe high priest's.   

{10:39} As for Ptolemais, and the land pertaining thereto, I give itas a free gift to the sanctuary at Jerusalem for the necessary expencesof the sanctuary.   

{10:40} Moreover I give every year fifteen thousand shekels ofsilver out of the king's accounts from the places appertaining.   

{10:41} And all the overplus, which the officers payed not in as informer time, from henceforth shall be given toward the works of thetemple.   

{10:42} And beside this, the five thousand shekels of silver, whichthey took from the uses of the temple out of the accounts year by year,even those things shall be released, because they appertain to thepriests that minister.   

{10:43} And whosoever they be that flee unto the temple atJerusalem, or be within the liberties hereof, being indebted unto theking, or for any other matter, let them be at liberty, and all thatthey have in my realm.   

{10:44} For the building also and repairing of the works of thesanctuary expences shall be given of the king's accounts.   

{10:45} Yea, and for the building of the walls of Jerusalem, and thefortifying thereof round about, expences shall be given out of theking's accounts, as also for the building of the walls in Judea.   

{10:46} Now when Jonathan and the people heard these words, theygave no credit unto them, nor received them, because they rememberedthe great evil that he had done in Israel; for he had afflicted themvery sore.   

{10:47} But with Alexander they were well pleased, because he wasthe first that entreated of true peace with them, and they wereconfederate with him always.   

{10:48} Then gathered king Alexander great forces, and camped overagainst Demetrius.   

{10:49} And after the two kings had joined battle, Demetrius' hostfled: but Alexander followed after him, and prevailed against them.   

{10:50} And he continued the battle very sore until the sun wentdown: and that day was Demetrius slain.   

{10:51} Afterward Alexander sent ambassadors to Ptolemee king ofEgypt with a message to this effect:   

{10:52} Forasmuch as I am come again to my realm, and am set in thethrone of my progenitors, and have gotten the dominion, and overthrownDemetrius, and recovered our country;   

{10:53} For after I had joined battle with him, both he and his hostwas discomfited by us, so that we sit in the throne of his kingdom:   

{10:54} Now therefore let us make a league of amity together, andgive me now thy daughter to wife: and I will be thy son in law, andwill give both thee and her as according to thy dignity.   

{10:55} Then Ptolemee the king gave answer, saying, Happy be the daywherein thou didst return into the land of thy fathers, and satest inthe throne of their kingdom.   

{10:56} And now will I do to thee, as thou hast written: meet metherefore at Ptolemais, that we may see one another; for I will marrymy daughter to thee according to thy desire.   

{10:57} So Ptolemee went out of Egypt with his daughter Cleopatra,and they came unto Ptolemais in the hundred threescore and second year:   

{10:58} Where king Alexander meeting him, he gave unto him hisdaughter Cleopatra, and celebrated her marriage at Ptolemais with greatglory, as the manner of kings is.   

{10:59} Now king Alexander had written unto Jonathan, that he shouldcome and meet him.   

{10:60} Who thereupon went honourably to Ptolemais, where he met thetwo kings, and gave them and their friends silver and gold, and manypresents, and found favour in their sight.   

{10:61} At that time certain pestilent fellows of Israel, men of awicked life, assembled themselves against him, to accuse him: but theking would not hear them.   

{10:62} Yea more than that, the king commanded to take off hisgarments, and clothe him in purple: and they did so.   

{10:63} And he made him sit by himself, and said into his princes,Go with him into the midst of the city, and make proclamation, that noman complain against him of any matter, and that no man trouble him forany manner of cause.   

{10:64} Now when his accusers saw that he was honored according tothe proclamation, and clothed in purple, they fled all away.   

{10:65} So the king honoured him, and wrote him among his chieffriends, and made him a duke, and partaker of his dominion.   

{10:66} Afterward Jonathan returned to Jerusalem with peace andgladness.   

{10:67} Furthermore in the; hundred threescore and fifth year cameDemetrius son of Demetrius out of Crete into the land of his fathers:   

{10:68} Whereof when king Alexander heard tell, he was right sorry,and returned into Antioch.   

{10:69} Then Demetrius made Apollonius the governor of Celosyria hisgeneral, who gathered together a great host, and camped in Jamnia, andsent unto Jonathan the high priest, saying,   

{10:70} Thou alone liftest up thyself against us, and I am laughedto scorn for thy sake, and reproached: and why dost thou vaunt thypower against us in the mountains?   

{10:71} Now therefore, if thou trustest in thine own strength, comedown to us into the plain field, and there let us try the mattertogether: for with me is the power of the cities.   

{10:72} Ask and learn who I am, and the rest that take our part, andthey shall tell thee that thy foot is not able to to flight in theirown land.   

{10:73} Wherefore now thou shalt not be able to abide the horsemenand so great a power in the plain, where is neither stone nor flint,nor place to flee unto.   

{10:74} So when Jonathan heard these words of Apollonius, he wasmoved in his mind, and choosing ten thousand men he went out ofJerusalem, where Simon his brother met him for to help him.   

{10:75} And he pitched his tents against Joppa: but; they of Joppashut him out of the city, because Apollonius had a garrison there.   

{10:76} Then Jonathan laid siege unto it: whereupon they of the citylet him in for fear: and so Jonathan won Joppa.   

{10:77} Whereof when Apollonius heard, he took three thousandhorsemen, with a great host of footmen, and went to Azotus as one thatjourneyed, and therewithal drew him forth into the plain. because hehad a great number of horsemen, in whom he put his trust.   

{10:78} Then Jonathan followed after him to Azotus, where the armiesjoined battle.   

{10:79} Now Apollonius had left a thousand horsemen in ambush.   

{10:80} And Jonathan knew that there was an ambushment behind him;for they had compassed in his host, and cast darts at the people, frommorning till evening.   

{10:81} But the people stood still, as Jonathan had commanded them:and so the enemies' horses were tired.   

{10:82} Then brought Simon forth his host, and set them against thefootmen, (for the horsemen were spent) who were discomfited by him, andfled.   

{10:83} The horsemen also, being scattered in the field, fled toAzotus, and went into Bethdagon, their idol's temple, for safety.   

{10:84} But Jonathan set fire on Azotus, and the cities round aboutit, and took their spoils; and the temple of Dagon, with them that werefled into it, he burned with fire.   

{10:85} Thus there were burned and slain with the sword well nigheight thousand men.   

{10:86} And from thence Jonathan removed his host, and campedagainst Ascalon, where the men of the city came forth, and met him withgreat pomp.   

{10:87} After this returned Jonathan and his host unto Jerusalem,having any spoils.   

{10:88} Now when king ALexander heard these things, he honouredJonathan yet more.   

{10:89} And sent him a buckle of gold, as the use is to be given tosuch as are of the king's blood: he gave him also Accaron with theborders thereof in possession.   

{11:1} And the king of Egypt gathered together a great host, likethe sand that lieth upon the sea shore, and many ships, and went aboutthrough deceit to get Alexander's kingdom, and join it to his own.   

{11:2} Whereupon he took his journey into Spain in peaceable manner,so as they of the cities opened unto him, and met him: for kingAlexander had commanded them so to do, because he was his brother inlaw.   

{11:3} Now as Ptolemee entered into the cities, he set in every oneof them a garrison of soldiers to keep it.   

{11:4} And when he came near to Azotus, they shewed him the templeof Dagon that was burnt, and Azotus and the suburbs thereof that weredestroyed, and the bodies that were cast abroad and them that he hadburnt in the battle; for they had made heaps of them by the way wherehe should pass.   

{11:5} Also they told the king whatsoever Jonathan had done, to theintent he might blame him: but the king held his peace.   

{11:6} Then Jonathan met the king with great pomp at Joppa, wherethey saluted one another, and lodged.   

{11:7} Afterward Jonathan, when he had gone with the king to theriver called Eleutherus, returned again to Jerusalem.   

{11:8} King Ptolemee therefore, having gotten the dominion of thecities by the sea unto Seleucia upon the sea coast, imagined wickedcounsels against Alexander.   

{11:9} Whereupon he sent ambasadors unto king Demetrius, saying,Come, let us make a league betwixt us, and I will give thee my daughterwhom Alexander hath, and thou shalt reign in thy father's kingdom:   

{11:10} For I repent that I gave my daughter unto him, for he soughtto slay me.   

{11:11} Thus did he slander him, because he was desirous of hiskingdom.   

{11:12} Wherefore he took his daughter from him, and gave her toDemetrius, and forsook Alexander, so that their hatred was openly known.   

{11:13} Then Ptolemee entered into Antioch, where he set two crownsupon his head, the crown of Asia, and of Egypt.   

{11:14} In the mean season was king Alexander in Cilicia, becausethose that dwelt in those parts had revolted from him.   

{11:15} But when Alexander heard of this, he came to war againsthim: whereupon king Ptolemee brought forth his host, and met him with amighty power, and put him to flight.   

{11:16} So Alexander fled into Arabia there to be defended; but kingPtolemee was exalted:   

{11:17} For Zabdiel the Arabian took off Alexander's head, and sentit unto Ptolemee.   

{11:18} King Ptolemee also died the third day after, and they thatwere in the strong holds were slain one of another.   

{11:19} By this means Demetrius reigned in the hundred threescoreand seventh year.   

{11:20} At the same time Jonathan gathered together them that werein Judea to take the tower that was in Jerusalem: and he made manyengines of war against it.   

{11:21} Then came ungodly persons, who hated their own people, wentunto the king, and told him that Jonathan besieged the tower,   

{11:22} Whereof when he heard, he was angry, and immediatelyremoving, he came to Ptolemais, and wrote unto Jonathan, that he shouldnot lay siege to the tower, but come and speak with him at Ptolemais ingreat haste.   

{11:23} Nevertheless Jonathan, when he heard this, commanded tobesiege it still: and he chose certain of the elders of Israel and thepriests, and put himself in peril;   

{11:24} And took silver and gold, and raiment, and divers presentsbesides, and went to Ptolemais unto the king, where he found favour inhis sight.   

{11:25} And though certain ungodly men of the people had madecomplaints against him,   

{11:26} Yet the king entreated him as his predecessors had donebefore, and promoted him in the sight of all his friends,   

{11:27} And confirmed him in the high priesthood, and in all thehonours that he had before, and gave him preeminence among his chieffriends.   

{11:28} Then Jonathan desired the king, that he would make Judeafree from tribute, as also the three governments, with the country ofSamaria; and he promised him three hundred talents.   

{11:29} So the king consented, and wrote letters unto Jonathan ofall these things after this manner:   

{11:30} King Demetrius unto his brother Jonathan, and unto thenation of the Jews, sendeth greeting:   

{11:31} We send you here a copy of the letter which we did writeunto our cousin Lasthenes concerning you, that ye might see it.   

{11:32} King Demetrius unto his father Lasthenes sendeth greeting:   

{11:33} We are determined to do good to the people of the Jews, whoare our friends, and keep covenants with us, because of their good willtoward us.   

{11:34} Wherefore we have ratified unto them the borders of Judea,with the three governments of Apherema and Lydda and Ramathem, that areadded unto Judea from the country of Samaria, and all thingsappertaining unto them, for all such as do sacrifice in Jerusalem,instead of the payments which the king received of them yearlyaforetime out of the fruits of the earth and of trees.   

{11:35} And as for other things that belong unto us, of the tithesand customs pertaining unto us, as also the saltpits, and the crowntaxes, which are due unto us, we discharge them of them all for theirrelief.   

{11:36} And nothing hereof shall be revoked from this time forth forever.   

{11:37} Now therefore see that thou make a copy of these things, andlet it be delivered unto Jonathan, and set upon the holy mount in aconspicuous place.   

{11:38} After this, when king Demetrius saw that the land was quietbefore him, and that no resistance was made against him, he sent awayall his forces, every one to his own place, except certain bands ofstrangers, whom he had gathered from the isles of the heathen:wherefore all the forces of his fathers hated him.   

{11:39} Moreover there was one Tryphon, that had been of Alexander'spart afore, who, seeing that all the host murmured against Demetrius,went to Simalcue the Arabian that brought up Antiochus the young son ofAlexander,   

{11:40} And lay sore upon him to deliver him this young Antiochus,that he might reign in his father's stead: he told him therefore allthat Demetrius had done, and how his men of war were at enmity withhim, and there he remained a long season.   

{11:41} In the mean time Jonathan sent unto king Demetrius, that hewould cast those of the tower out of Jerusalem, and those also in thefortresses: for they fought against Israel.   

{11:42} So Demetrius sent unto Jonathan, saying, I will not only dothis for thee and thy people, but I will greatly honour thee and thynation, if opportunity serve.   

{11:43} Now therefore thou shalt do well, if thou send me men tohelp me; for all my forces are gone from me.   

{11:44} Upon this Jonathan sent him three thousand strong men untoAntioch: and when they came to the king, the king was very glad oftheir coming.   

{11:45} Howbeit they that were of the city gathered themselvestogether into the midst of the city, to the number of an hundred andtwenty thousand men, and would have slain the king.   

{11:46} Wherefore the king fled into the court, but they of the citykept the passages of the city, and began to fight.   

{11:47} Then the king called to the Jews for help, who came unto himall at once, and dispersing themselves through the city slew that dayin the city to the number of an hundred thousand.   

{11:48} Also they set fire on the city, and gat many spoils thatday, and delivered the king.   

{11:49} So when they of the city saw that the Jews had got the cityas they would, their courage was abated: wherefore they madesupplication to the king, and cried, saying,   

{11:50} Grant us peace, and let the Jews cease from assaulting usand the city.   

{11:51} With that they cast away their weapons, and made peace; andthe Jews were honoured in the sight of the king, and in the sight ofall that were in his realm; and they returned to Jerusalem, havinggreat spoils.   

{11:52} So king Demetrius sat on the throne of his kingdom, and theland was quiet before him.   

{11:53} Nevertheless he dissembled in all that ever he spake, andestranged himself from Jonathan, neither rewarded he him according tothe benefits which he had received of him, but troubled him very sore.   

{11:54} After this returned Tryphon, and with him the young childAntiochus, who reigned, and was crowned.   

{11:55} Then there gathered unto him all the men of war, whomDemetrius had put away, and they fought against Demetrius, who turnedhis back and fled.   

{11:56} Moreover Tryphon took the elephants, and won Antioch.   

{11:57} At that time young Antiochus wrote unto Jonathan, saying, Iconfirm thee in the high priesthood, and appoint thee ruler over thefour governments, and to be one of the king's friends.   

{11:58} Upon this he sent him golden vessels to be served in, andgave him leave to drink in gold, and to be clothed in purple, and towear a golden buckle.   

{11:59} His brother Simon also he made captain from the place calledThe ladder of Tyrus unto the borders of Egypt.   

{11:60} Then Jonathan went forth, and passed through the citiesbeyond the water, and all the forces of Syria gathered themselves untohim for to help him: and when he came to Ascalon, they of the city methim honourably.   

{11:61} From whence he went to Gaza, but they of Gaza shut him out;wherefore he laid siege unto it, and burned the suburbs thereof withfire, and spoiled them.   

{11:62} Afterward, when they of Gaza made supplication untoJonathan, he made peace with them, and took the sons of their chief menfor hostages, and sent them to Jerusalem, and passed through thecountry unto Damascus.   

{11:63} Now when Jonathan heard that Demetrius' princes were come toCades, which is in Galilee, with a great power, purposing to remove himout of the country,   

{11:64} He went to meet them, and left Simon his brother in thecountry.   

{11:65} Then Simon encamped against Bethsura and fought against it along season, and shut it up:   

{11:66} But they desired to have peace with him, which he grantedthem, and then put them out from thence, and took the city, and set agarrison in it.   

{11:67} As for Jonathan and his host, they pitched at the water ofGennesar, from whence betimes in the morning they gat them to the plainof Nasor.   

{11:68} And, behold, the host of strangers met them in the plain,who, having laid men in ambush for him in the mountains, camethemselves over against him.   

{11:69} So when they that lay in ambush rose out of their places andjoined battle, all that were of Jonathan's side fled;   

{11:70} Insomuch as there was not one of them left, exceptMattathias the son of Absalom, and Judas the son of Calphi, thecaptains of the host.   

{11:71} Then Jonathan rent his clothes, and cast earth upon hishead, and prayed.   

{11:72} Afterwards turning again to battle, he put them to flight,and so they ran away.   

{11:73} Now when his own men that were fled saw this, they turnedagain unto him, and with him pursued them to Cades, even unto their owntents, and there they camped.   

{11:74} So there were slain of the heathen that day about threethousand men: but Jonathan returned to Jerusalem.   

{12:1} Now when Jonathan saw that time served him, he chose certainmen, and sent them to Rome, for to confirm and renew the friendshipthat they had with them.   

{12:2} He sent letters also to the Lacedemonians, and to otherplaces, for the same purpose.   

{12:3} So they went unto Rome, and entered into the senate, andsaid, Jonathan the high priest, and the people of the Jews, sent usunto you, to the end ye should renew the friendship, which ye had withthem, and league, as in former time.   

{12:4} Upon this the Romans gave them letters unto the governors ofevery place that they should bring them into the land of Judeapeaceably.   

{12:5} And this is the copy of the letters which Jonathan wrote tothe Lacedemonians:   

{12:6} Jonathan the high priest, and the elders of the nation, andthe priests, and the other of the Jews, unto the Lacedemonians theirbrethren send greeting:   

{12:7} There were letters sent in times past unto Onias the highpriest from Darius, who reigned then among you, to signify that ye areour brethren, as the copy here underwritten doth specify.   

{12:8} At which time Onias entreated the ambassador that was senthonourably, and received the letters, wherein declaration was made ofthe league and friendship.   

{12:9} Therefore we also, albeit we need none of these things, thatwe have the holy books of scripture in our hands to comfort us,   

{12:10} Have nevertheless attempted to send unto you for therenewing of brotherhood and friendship, lest we should become strangersunto you altogether: for there is a long time passed since ye sent untous.   

{12:11} We therefore at all times without ceasing, both in ourfeasts, and other convenient days, do remember you in the sacrificeswhich we offer, and in our prayers, as reason is, and as it becometh usto think upon our brethren:   

{12:12} And we are right glad of your honour.   

{12:13} As for ourselves, we have had great troubles and wars onevery side, forsomuch as the kings that are round about us have foughtagainst us.   

{12:14} Howbeit we would not be troublesome unto you, nor to othersof our confederates and friends, in these wars:   

{12:15} For we have help from heaven that succoureth us, so as weare delivered from our enemies, and our enemies are brought under foot.   

{12:16} For this cause we chose Numenius the son of Antiochus, andAntipater he son of Jason, and sent them unto the Romans, to renew theamity that we had with them, and the former league.   

{12:17} We commanded them also to go unto you, and to salute and todeliver you our letters concerning the renewing of our brotherhood.   

{12:18} Wherefore now ye shall do well to give us an answer thereto.   

{12:19} And this is the copy of the letters which Oniares sent.   

{12:20} Areus king of the Lacedemonians to Onias the high priest,greeting:   

{12:21} It is found in writing, that the Lacedemonians and Jews arebrethren, and that they are of the stock of Abraham:   

{12:22} Now therefore, since this is come to our knowledge, ye shalldo well to write unto us of your prosperity.   

{12:23} We do write back again to you, that your cattle and goodsare our's, and our's are your's We do command therefore our ambassadorsto make report unto you on this wise.   

{12:24} Now when Jonathan heard that Demebius' princes were come tofight against him with a greater host than afore,   

{12:25} He removed from Jerusalem, and met them in the land ofAmathis: for he gave them no respite to enter his country.   

{12:26} He sent spies also unto their tents, who came again, andtold him that they were appointed to come upon them in the night season.   

{12:27} Wherefore so soon as the sun was down, Jonathan commandedhis men to watch, and to be in arms, that all the night long they mightbe ready to fight: also he sent forth centinels round about the host.   

{12:28} But when the adversaries heard that Jonathan and his menwere ready for battle, they feared, and trembled in their hearts, andthey kindled fires in their camp.   

{12:29} Howbeit Jonathan and his company knew it not till themorning: for they saw the lights burning.   

{12:30} Then Jonathan pursued after them, but overtook them not: forthey were gone over the river Eleutherus.   

{12:31} Wherefore Jonathan turned to the Arabians, who were calledZabadeans, and smote them, and took their spoils.   

{12:32} And removing thence, he came to Damascus, and so passedthrough all the country,   

{12:33} Simon also went forth, and passed through the country untoAscalon, and the holds there adjoining, from whence he turned aside toJoppa, and won it.   

{12:34} For he had heard that they would deliver the hold unto themthat took Demetrius' part; wherefore he set a garrison there to keep it.   

{12:35} After this came Jonathan home again, and calling the eldersof the people together, he consulted with them about building strongholds in Judea,   

{12:36} And making the walls of Jerusalem higher, and raising agreat mount between the tower and the city, for to separate it from thecity, that so it might be alone, that men might neither sell nor buy init.   

{12:37} Upon this they came together to build up the city, forasmuchas part of the wall toward the brook on the east side was fallen down,and they repaired that which was called Caphenatha.   

{12:38} Simon also set up Adida in Sephela, and made it strong withgates and bars.   

{12:39} Now Tryphon went about to get the kingdom of Asia, and tokill Antiochus the king, that he might set the crown upon his own head.   

{12:40} Howbeit he was afraid that Jonathan would not suffer him,and that he would fight against him; wherefore he sought a way how totake Jonathan, that he might kill him. So he removed, and came toBethsan.   

{12:41} Then Jonathan went out to meet him with forty thousand menchosen for the battle, and came to Bethsan.   

{12:42} Now when Tryphon saw Jonathan came with so great a force, hedurst not stretch his hand against him;   

{12:43} But received him honourably, and commended him unto all hisfriends, and gave him gifts, and commanded his men of war to be asobedient unto him, as to himself.   

{12:44} Unto Jonathan also he said, Why hast thou brought all thispeople to so great trouble, seeing there is no war betwixt us?   

{12:45} Therefore send them now home again, and choose a few men towait on thee, and come thou with me to Ptolemais, for I will give itthee, and the rest of the strong holds and forces, and all that haveany charge: as for me, I will return and depart: for this is the causeof my coming.   

{12:46} So Jonathan believing him did as he bade him, and sent awayhis host, who went into the land of Judea.   

{12:47} And with himself he retained but three thousand men, of whomhe sent two thousand into Galilee, and one thousand went with him.   

{12:48} Now as soon as Jonathan entered into Ptolemais, they ofPtolemais shut the gates and took him, and all them that came with himthey slew with the sword.   

{12:49} Then sent Tryphon an host of footmen and horsemen intoGalilee, and into the great plain, to destroy all Jonathan's company.   

{12:50} But when they knew that Jonathan and they that were with himwere taken and slain, they encouraged one another; and went closetogether, prepared to fight.   

{12:51} They therefore that followed upon them, perceiving that theywere ready to fight for their lives, turned back again.   

{12:52} Whereupon they all came into the land of Judea peaceably,and there they bewailed Jonathan, and them that were with him, and theywere sore afraid; wherefore all Israel made great lamentation.   

{12:53} Then all the heathen that were round about then sought todestroy them: for said they, They have no captain, nor any to helpthem: now therefore let us make war upon them, and take away theirmemorial from among men.   

{13:1} Now when Simon heard that Tryphon had gathered together agreat host to invade the land of Judea, and destroy it,   

{13:2} And saw that the people was in great trembling and fear, hewent up to Jerusalem, and gathered the people together,   

{13:3} And gave them exhortation, saying, Ye yourselves know whatgreat things I, and my brethren, and my father's house, have done forthe laws and the sanctuary, the battles also and troubles which we haveseen.   

{13:4} By reason whereof all my brethren are slain for Israel'ssake, and I am left alone.   

{13:5} Now therefore be it far from me, that I should spare mine ownlife in any time of trouble: for I am no better than my brethren.   

{13:6} Doubtless I will avenge my nation, and the sanctuary, and ourwives, and our children: for all the heathen are gathered to destroy usof very malice.   

{13:7} Now as soon as the people heard these words, their spiritrevived.   

{13:8} And they answered with a loud voice, saying, Thou shalt beour leader instead of Judas and Jonathan thy brother.   

{13:9} Fight thou our battles, and whatsoever, thou commandest us,that will we do.   

{13:10} So then he gathered together all the men of war, and madehaste to finish the walls of Jerusalem, and he fortified it round about.   

{13:11} Also he sent Jonathan the son of Absolom, and with him agreat power, to Joppa: who casting out them that were therein remainedthere in it.   

{13:12} So Tryphon removed from Ptolemaus with a great power toinvade the land of Judea, and Jonathan was with him in ward.   

{13:13} But Simon pitched his tents at Adida, over against the plain.   

{13:14} Now when Tryphon knew that Simon was risen up instead of hisbrother Jonathan, and meant to join battle with him, he sent messengersunto him, saying,   

{13:15} Whereas we have Jonathan thy brother in hold, it is formoney that he is owing unto the king's treasure, concerning thebusiness that was committed unto him.   

{13:16} Wherefore now send an hundred talents of silver, and two ofhis sons for hostages, that when he is at liberty he may not revoltfrom us, and we will let him go.   

{13:17} Hereupon Simon, albeit he perceived that they spakedeceitfully unto him yet sent he the money and the children, lestperadventure he should procure to himself great hatred of the people:   

{13:18} Who might have said, Because I sent him not the money andthe children, therefore is Jonathan dead.   

{13:19} So he sent them the children and the hundred talents:howbeit Tryphon dissembled neither would he let Jonathan go.   

{13:20} And after this came Tryphon to invade the land, and destroyit, going round about by the way that leadeth unto Adora: but Simon andhis host marched against him in every place, wheresoever he went.   

{13:21} Now they that were in the tower sent messengers untoTryphon, to the end that he should hasten his coming unto them by thewilderness, and send them victuals.   

{13:22} Wherefore Tryphon made ready all his horsemen to come thatnight: but there fell a very great snow, by reason whereof he came not.So he departed, and came into the country of Galaad.   

{13:23} And when he came near to Bascama he slew Jonathan, who wasburied there.   

{13:24} Afterward Tryphon returned and went into his own land.   

{13:25} Then sent Simon, and took the bones of Jonathan his brother,and buried them in Modin, the city of his fathers.   

{13:26} And all Israel made great lamentation for him, and bewailedhim many days.   

{13:27} Simon also built a monument upon the sepulchre of his fatherand his brethren, and raised it aloft to the sight, with hewn stonebehind and before.   

{13:28} Moreover he set up seven pyramids, one against another, forhis father, and his mother, and his four brethren.   

{13:29} And in these he made cunning devices, about the which he setgreat pillars, and upon the pillars he made all their armour for aperpetual memory, and by the armour ships carved, that they might beseen of all that sail on the sea.   

{13:30} This is the sepulchre which he made at Modin, and itstandeth yet unto this day.   

{13:31} Now Tryphon dealt deceitfully with the young king Antiochus,and slew him.   

{13:32} And he reigned in his stead, and crowned himself king ofAsia, and brought a great calamity upon the land.   

{13:33} Then Simon built up the strong holds in Judea, and fencedthem about with high towers, and great walls, and gates, and bars, andlaid up victuals therein.   

{13:34} Moreover Simon chose men, and sent to king Demetrius, to theend he should give the land an immunity, because all that Tryphon didwas to spoil.   

{13:35} Unto whom king Demetrius answered and wrote after thismanner:   

{13:36} King Demetrius unto Simon the high priest, and friend ofkings, as also unto the elders and nation of the Jews, sendeth greeting:   

{13:37} The golden crown, and the scarlet robe, which ye sent untous, we have received: and we are ready to make a stedfast peace withyou, yea, and to write unto our officers, to confirm the immunitieswhich we have granted.   

{13:38} And whatsoever covenants we have made with you shall stand;and the strong holds, which ye have builded, shall be your own.   

{13:39} As for any oversight or fault committed unto this day, weforgive it, and the crown tax also, which ye owe us: and if there wereany other tribute paid in Jerusalem, it shall no more be paid.   

{13:40} And look who are meet among you to be in our court, let thenbe enrolled, and let there be peace betwixt us.   

{13:41} Thus the yoke of the heathen was taken away from Israel inthe hundred and seventieth year.   

{13:42} Then the people of Israel began to write in theirinstruments and contracts, In the first year of Simon the high priest,the governor and leader of the Jews.   

{13:43} In those days Simon camped against Gaza and besieged itround about; he made also an engine of war, and set it by the city, andbattered a certain tower, and took it.   

{13:44} And they that were in the engine leaped into the city;whereupon there was a great uproar in the city:   

{13:45} Insomuch as the people of the city rent their clothes, andclimbed upon the walls with their wives and children, and cried with aloud voice, beseeching Simon to grant them peace.   

{13:46} And they said, Deal not with us according to our wickedness,but according to thy mercy.   

{13:47} So Simon was appeased toward them, and fought no moreagainst them, but put them out of the city, and cleansed the houseswherein the idols were, and so entered into it with songs andthanksgiving.   

{13:48} Yea, he put all uncleanness out of it, and placed such menthere as would keep the law, and made it stronger than it was before,and built therein a dwellingplace for himself.   

{13:49} They also of the tower in Jerusalem were kept so strait,that they could neither come forth, nor go into the country, nor buy,nor sell: wherefore they were in great distress for want of victuals,and a great number of them perished through famine.   

{13:50} Then cried they to Simon, beseeching him to be at one withthem: which thing he granted them; and when he had put them out fromthence, he cleansed the tower from pollutions:   

{13:51} And entered into it the three and twentieth day of thesecond month in the hundred seventy and first year, with thanksgiving,and branches of palm trees, and with harps, and cymbals, and withviols, and hymns, and songs: because there was destroyed a great enemyout of Israel.   

{13:52} He ordained also that that day should be kept every yearwith gladness. Moreover the hill of the temple that was by the tower hemade stronger than it was, and there he dwelt himself with his company.   

{13:53} And when Simon saw that John his son was a valiant man, hemade him captain of all the hosts; and he dwelt in Gazera.   

{14:1} Now in the hundred threescore and twelfth year king Demetriusgathered his forces together, and went into Media to get him help tofight against Tryphone.   

{14:2} But when Arsaces, the king of Persia and Media, heard thatDemetrius was entered within his borders, he sent one of his princes totake him alive:   

{14:3} Who went and smote the host of Demetrius, and took him, andbrought him to Arsaces, by whom he was put in ward.   

{14:4} As for the land of Judea, that was quiet all the days ofSimon; for he sought the good of his nation in such wise, as thatevermore his authority and honour pleased them well.   

{14:5} And as he was honourable in all his acts, so in this, that hetook Joppa for an haven, and made an entrance to the isles of the sea,   

{14:6} And enlarged the bounds of his nation, and recovered thecountry,   

{14:7} And gathered together a great number of captives, and had thedominion of Gazera, and Bethsura, and the tower, out of the which hetook all uncleaness, neither was there any that resisted him.   

{14:8} Then did they till their ground in peace, and the earth gaveher increase, and the trees of the field their fruit.   

{14:9} The ancient men sat all in the streets, communing together ofgood things, and the young men put on glorious and warlike apparel.   

{14:10} He provided victuals for the cities, and set in them allmanner of munition, so that his honourable name was renowned unto theend of the world.   

{14:11} He made peace in the land, and Israel rejoiced with greatjoy:   

{14:12} For every man sat under his vine and his fig tree, and therewas none to fray them:   

{14:13} Neither was there any left in the land to fight againstthem: yea, the kings themselves were overthrown in those days.   

{14:14} Moreover he strengthened all those of his people that werebrought low: the law he searched out; and every contemner of the lawand wicked person he took away.   

{14:15} He beautified the sanctuary, and multiplied vessels of thetemple.   

{14:16} Now when it was heard at Rome, and as far as Sparta, thatJonathan was dead, they were very sorry.   

{14:17} But as soon as they heard that his brother Simon was madehigh priest in his stead, and ruled the country, and the cities therein:   

{14:18} They wrote unto him in tables of brass, to renew thefriendship and league which they had made with Judas and Jonathan hisbrethren:   

{14:19} Which writings were read before the congregation atJerusalem.   

{14:20} And this is the copy of the letters that the Lacedemonianssent; The rulers of the Lacedemonians, with the city, unto Simon thehigh priest, and the elders, and priests, and residue of the people ofthe Jews, our brethren, send greeting:   

{14:21} The ambassadors that were sent unto our people certified usof your glory and honour: wherefore we were glad of their coming,   

{14:22} And did register the things that they spake in the councilof the people in this manner; Numenius son of Antiochus, and Antipaterson of Jason, the Jews' ambassadors, came unto us to renew thefriendship they had with us.   

{14:23} And it pleased the people to entertain the men honourably,and to put the copy of their ambassage in publick records, to the endthe people of the Lacedemonians might have a memorial thereof:furthermore we have written a copy thereof unto Simon the high priest.   

{14:24} After this Simon sent Numenius to Rome with a great shieldof gold of a thousand pound weight to confirm the league with them.   

{14:25} Whereof when the people heard, they said, What thanks shallwe give to Simon and his sons?   

{14:26} For he and his brethren and the house of his father haveestablished Israel, and chased away in fight their enemies from them,and confirmed their liberty.   

{14:27} So then they wrote it in tables of brass, which they setupon pillars in mount Sion: and this is the copy of the writing; Theeighteenth day of the month Elul, in the hundred threescore and twelfthyear, being the third year of Simon the high priest,   

{14:28} At Saramel in the great congregation of the priests, andpeople, and rulers of the nation, and elders of the country, were thesethings notified unto us.   

{14:29} Forasmuch as oftentimes there have been wars in the country,wherein for the maintenance of their sanctuary, and the law, Simon theson of Mattathias, of the posterity of Jarib, together with hisbrethren, put themselves in jeopardy, and resisting the enemies oftheir nation did their nation great honour:   

{14:30} (For after that Jonathan, having gathered his nationtogether, and been their high priest, was added to his people,   

{14:31} Their enemies prepared to invade their country, that theymight destroy it, and lay hands on the sanctuary:   

{14:32} At which time Simon rose up, and fought for his nation, andspent much of his own substance, and armed the valiant men of hisnation and gave them wages,   

{14:33} And fortified the cities of Judea, together with Bethsura,that lieth upon the borders of Judea, where the armour of the enemieshad been before; but he set a garrison of Jews there:   

{14:34} Moreover he fortified Joppa, which lieth upon the sea, andGazera, that bordereth upon Azotus, where the enemies had dwelt before:but he placed Jews there, and furnished them with all things convenientfor the reparation thereof.)   

{14:35} The people therefore sang the acts of Simon, and unto whatglory he thought to bring his nation, made him their governor and chiefpriest, because he had done all these things, and for the justice andfaith which he kept to his nation, and for that he sought by all meansto exalt his people.   

{14:36} For in his time things prospered in his hands, so that theheathen were taken out of their country, and they also that were in thecity of David in Jerusalem, who had made themselves a tower, out ofwhich they issued, and polluted all about the sanctuary, and did muchhurt in the holy place:   

{14:37} But he placed Jews therein. and fortified it for the safetyof the country and the city, and raised up the walls of Jerusalem.   

{14:38} King Demetrius also confirmed him in the high priesthoodaccording to those things,   

{14:39} And made him one of his friends, and honoured him with greathonour.   

{14:40} For he had heard say, that the Romans had called the Jewstheir friends and confederates and brethren; and that they hadentertained the ambassadors of Simon honourably;   

{14:41} Also that the Jews and priests were well pleased that Simonshould be their governor and high priest for ever, until there shouldarise a faithful prophet;   

{14:42} Moreover that he should be their captain, and should takecharge of the sanctuary, to set them over their works, and over thecountry, and over the armour, and over the fortresses, that, I say, heshould take charge of the sanctuary;   

{14:43} Beside this, that he should be obeyed of every man, and thatall the writings in the country should be made in his name, and that heshould be clothed in purple, and wear gold:   

{14:44} Also that it should be lawful for none of the people orpriests to break any of these things, or to gainsay his words, or togather an assembly in the country without him, or to be clothed inpurple, or wear a buckle of gold;   

{14:45} And whosoever should do otherwise, or break any of thesethings, he should be punished.   

{14:46} Thus it liked all the people to deal with Simon, and to doas hath been said.   

{14:47} Then Simon accepted hereof, and was well pleased to be highpriest, and captain and governor of the Jews and priests, and to defendthem all.   

{14:48} So they commanded that this writing should be put in tablesof brass, and that they should be set up within the compass of thesanctuary in a conspicuous place;   

{14:49} Also that the copies thereof should be laid up in thetreasury, to the end that Simon and his sons might have them.   

{15:1} Moreover Antiochus son of Demetrius the king sent lettersfrom the isles of the sea unto Simon the priest and prince of the Jews,and to all the people;   

{15:2} The contents whereof were these: King Antiochus to Simon thehigh priest and prince of his nation, and to the people of the Jews,greeting:   

{15:3} Forasmuch as certain pestilent men have usurped the kingdomof our fathers, and my purpose is to challenge it again, that I mayrestore it to the old estate, and to that end have gathered a multitudeof foreign soldiers together, and prepared ships of war;   

{15:4} My meaning also being to go through the country, that I maybe avenged of them that have destroyed it, and made many cities in thekingdom desolate:   

{15:5} Now therefore I confirm unto thee all the oblations which thekings before me granted thee, and whatsoever gifts besides they granted.   

{15:6} I give thee leave also to coin money for thy country withthine own stamp.   

{15:7} And as concerning Jerusalem and the sanctuary, let them befree; and all the armour that thou hast made, and fortresses that thouhast built, and keepest in thine hands, let them remain unto thee.   

{15:8} And if anything be, or shall be, owing to the king, let it beforgiven thee from this time forth for evermore.   

{15:9} Furthermore, when we have obtained our kingdom, we willhonour thee, and thy nation, and thy temple, with great honour, so thatyour honour shall be known throughout the world.   

{15:10} In the hundred threescore and fourteenth year went Antiochusinto the land of his fathers: at which time all the forces cametogether unto him, so that few were left with Tryphon.   

{15:11} Wherefore being pursued by king Antiochus, he fled untoDora, which lieth by the sea side:   

{15:12} For he saw that troubles came upon him all at once, and thathis forces had forsaken him.   

{15:13} Then camped Antiochus against Dora, having with him anhundred and twenty thousand men of war, and eight thousand horsemen.   

{15:14} And when he had compassed the city round about, and joinedships close to the town on the sea side, he vexed the city by land andby sea, neither suffered he any to go out or in.   

{15:15} In the mean season came Numenius and his company from Rome,having letters to the kings and countries; wherein were written thesethings:   

{15:16} Lucius, consul of the Romans unto king Ptolemee, greeting:   

{15:17} The Jews' ambassadors, our friends and confederates, cameunto us to renew the old friendship and league, being sent from Simonthe high priest, and from the people of the Jews:   

{15:18} And they brought a shield of gold of a thousand pound.   

{15:19} We thought it good therefore to write unto the kings andcountries, that they should do them no harm, nor fight against them,their cities, or countries, nor yet aid their enemies against them.   

{15:20} It seemed also good to us to receive the shield of them.   

{15:21} If therefore there be any pestilent fellows, that have fledfrom their country unto you, deliver them unto Simon the high priest,that he may punish them according to their own law.   

{15:22} The same things wrote he likewise unto Demetrius the king,and Attalus, to Ariarathes, and Arsaces,   

{15:23} And to all the countries and to Sampsames, and theLacedemonians, and to Delus, and Myndus, and Sicyon, and Caria, andSamos, and Pamphylia, and Lycia, and Halicarnassus, and Rhodus, andAradus, and Cos, and Side, and Aradus, and Gortyna, and Cnidus, andCyprus, and Cyrene.   

{15:24} And the copy hereof they wrote to Simon the high priest.   

{15:25} So Antiochus the king camped against Dora the second day,assaulting it continually, and making engines, by which means he shutup Tryphon, that he could neither go out nor in.   

{15:26} At that time Simon sent him two thousand chosen men to aidhim; silver also, and gold, and much armour.   

{15:27} Nevertheless he would not receive them, but brake all thecovenants which he had made with him afore, and became strange unto him.   

{15:28} Furthermore he sent unto him Athenobius, one of his friends,to commune with him, and say, Ye withhold Joppa and Gazera; with thetower that is in Jerusalem, which are cities of my realm.   

{15:29} The borders thereof ye have wasted, and done great hurt inthe land, and got the dominion of many places within my kingdom.   

{15:30} Now therefore deliver the cities which ye have taken, andthe tributes of the places, whereof ye have gotten dominion without theborders of Judea:   

{15:31} Or else give me for them five hundred talents of silver; andfor the harm that ye have done, and the tributes of the cities, otherfive hundred talents: if not, we will come and fight against you   

{15:32} So Athenobius the king's friend came to Jerusalem: and whenhe saw the glory of Simon, and the cupboard of gold and silver plate,and his great attendance, he was astonished, and told him the king'smessage.   

{15:33} Then answered Simon, and said unto him, We have neithertaken other men's land, nor holden that which appertaineth to others,but the inheritance of our fathers, which our enemies had wrongfully inpossession a certain time.   

{15:34} Wherefore we, having opportunity, hold the inheritance ofour fathers.   

{15:35} And whereas thou demandest Joppa and Gazera, albeit they didgreat harm unto the people in our country, yet will we give thee anhundred talents for them. Hereunto Athenobius answered him not a word;   

{15:36} But returned in a rage to the king, and made report unto himof these speeches, and of the glory of Simon, and of all that he hadseen: whereupon the king was exceeding wroth.   

{15:37} In the mean time fled Tryphon by ship unto Orthosias.   

{15:38} Then the king made Cendebeus captain of the sea coast, andgave him an host of footmen and horsemen,   

{15:39} And commanded him to remove his host toward Judea; also hecommanded him to build up Cedron, and to fortify the gates, and to waragainst the people; but as for the king himself, he pursued Tryphon.   

{15:40} So Cendebeus came to Jamnia and began to provoke the peopleand to invade Judea, and to take the people prisoners, and slay them.   

{15:41} And when he had built up Cedrou, he set horsemen there, andan host of footmen, to the end that issuing out they might makeoutroads upon the ways of Judea, as the king had commanded him.   

{16:1} Then came up John from Gazera, and told Simon his father whatCendebeus had done.   

{16:2} Wherefore Simon called his two eldest sons, Judas and John,and said unto them, I, and my brethren, and my father's house, haveever from my youth unto this day fought against the enemies of Israel;and things have prospered so well in our hands, that we have deliveredIsrael oftentimes.   

{16:3} But now I am old, and ye, by God's mercy, are of a sufficientage: be ye instead of me and my brother, and go and fight for ournation, and the help from heaven be with you.   

{16:4} So he chose out of the country twenty thousand men of warwith horsemen, who went out against Cendebeus, and rested that night atModin.   

{16:5} And when as they rose in the morning, and went into theplain, behold, a mighty great host both of footmen and horsemen cameagainst them: howbeit there was a water brook betwixt them.   

{16:6} So he and his people pitched over against them: and when hesaw that the people were afraid to go over the water brook, he wentfirst over himself, and then the men seeing him passed through afterhim.   

{16:7} That done, he divided his men, and set the horsemen in themidst of the footmen: for the enemies' horsemen were very many.   

{16:8} Then sounded they with the holy trumpets: whereupon Cendebeusand his host were put to flight, so that many of them were slain, andthe remnant gat them to the strong hold.   

{16:9} At that time was Judas John's brother wounded; but John stillfollowed after them, until he came to Cedron, which Cendebeus had built.   

{16:10} So they fled even unto the towers in the fields of Azotus;wherefore he burned it with fire: so that there were slain of themabout two thousand men. Afterward he returned into the land of Judea inpeace.   

{16:11} Moreover in the plain of Jericho was Ptolemeus the son ofAbubus made captain, and he had abundance of silver and gold:   

{16:12} For he was the high priest's son in law.   

{16:13} Wherefore his heart being lifted up, he thought to get thecountry to himself, and thereupon consulted deceitfully against Simonand his sons to destroy them.   

{16:14} Now Simon was visiting the cities that were in the country,and taking care for the good ordering of them; at which time he camedown himself to Jericho with his sons, Mattathias and Judas, in thehundred threescore and seventeenth year, in the eleventh month, calledSabat:   

{16:15} Where the son of Abubus receiving them deceitfully into alittle hold, called Docus, which he had built, made them a greatbanquet: howbeit he had hid men there.   

{16:16} So when Simon and his sons had drunk largely, Ptolemee andhis men rose up, and took their weapons, and came upon Simon into thebanqueting place, and slew him, and his two sons, and certain of hisservants.   

{16:17} In which doing he committed a great treachery, andrecompensed evil for good.   

{16:18} Then Ptolemee wrote these things, and sent to the king, thathe should send him an host to aid him, and he would deliver him thecountry and cities.   

{16:19} He sent others also to Gazera to kill John: and unto thetribunes he sent letters to come unto him, that he might give themsilver, and gold, and rewards.   

{16:20} And others he sent to take Jerusalem, and the mountain ofthe temple.   

{16:21} Now one had run afore to Gazera and told John that hisfather and brethren were slain, and, quoth he, Ptolemee hath sent toslay thee also.   

{16:22} Hereof when he heard, he was sore astonished: so he laidhands on them that were come to destroy him, and slew them; for he knewthat they sought to make him away.   

{16:23} As concerning the rest of the acts of John, and his wars,and worthy deeds which he did, and the building of the walls which hemade, and his doings,   

{16:24} Behold, these are written in the chronicles of hispriesthood, from the time he was made high priest after his father.The Second Book of the Maccabees   

{1:1} The brethren, the Jews that be at Jerusalem and in the land ofJudea, wish unto the brethren, the Jews that are throughout Egypthealth and peace:   

{1:2} God be gracious unto you, and remember his covenant that hemade with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, his faithful servants;   

{1:3} And give you all an heart to serve him, and to do his will,with a good courage and a willing mind;   

{1:4} And open your hearts in his law and commandments, and send youpeace,   

{1:5} And hear your prayers, and be at one with you, and neverforsake you in time of trouble.   

{1:6} And now we be here praying for you.   

{1:7} What time as Demetrius reigned, in the hundred threescore andninth year, we the Jews wrote unto you in the extremity of trouble thatcame upon us in those years, from the time that Jason and his companyrevolted from the holy land and kingdom,   

{1:8} And burned the porch, and shed innocent blood: then we prayedunto the Lord, and were heard; we offered also sacrifices and fineflour, and lighted the lamps, and set forth the loaves.   

{1:9} And now see that ye keep the feast of tabernacles in the monthCasleu.   

{1:10} In the hundred fourscore and eighth year, the people thatwere at Jerusalem and in Judea, and the council, and Judas, sentgreeting and health unto Aristobulus, king Ptolemeus' master, who wasof the stock of the anointed priests, and to the Jews that were inEgypt:   

{1:11} Insomuch as God hath delivered us from great perils, we thankhim highly, as having been in battle against a king.   

{1:12} For he cast them out that fought within the holy city.   

{1:13} For when the leader was come into Persia, and the army withhim that seemed invincible, they were slain in the temple of Nanea bythe deceit of Nanea's priests.   

{1:14} For Antiochus, as though he would marry her, came into theplace, and his friends that were with him, to receive money in name ofa dowry.   

{1:15} Which when the priests of Nanea had set forth, and he wasentered with a small company into the compass of the temple, they shutthe temple as soon as Antiochus was come in:   

{1:16} And opening a privy door of the roof, they threw stones likethunderbolts, and struck down the captain, hewed them in pieces, smoteoff their heads and cast them to those that were without.   

{1:17} Blessed be our God in all things, who hath delivered up theungodly.   

{1:18} Therefore whereas we are now purposed to keep thepurification of the temple upon the five and twentieth day of the monthCasleu, we thought it necessary to certify you thereof, that ye alsomight keep it, as the feast of the tabernacles, and of the fire, whichwas given us when Neemias offered sacrifice, after that he had buildedthe temple and the altar.   

{1:19} For when our fathers were led into Persia, the priests thatwere then devout took the fire of the altar privily, and hid it in anhollow place of a pit without water, where they kept it sure, so thatthe place was unknown to all men.   

{1:20} Now after many years, when it pleased God, Neemias, beingsent from the king of Persia, did send of the posterity of thosepriests that had hid it to the fire: but when they told us they foundno fire, but thick water;   

{1:21} Then commanded he them to draw it up, and to bring it; andwhen the sacrifices were laid on, Neemias commanded the priests tosprinkle the wood and the things laid thereupon with the water.   

{1:22} When this was done, and the time came that the sun shone,which afore was hid in the cloud, there was a great fire kindled, sothat every man marvelled.   

{1:23} And the priests made a prayer whilst the sacrifice wasconsuming, I say, both the priests, and all the rest, Jonathanbeginning, and the rest answering thereunto, as Neemias did.   

{1:24} And the prayer was after this manner; O Lord, Lord God,Creator of all things, who art fearful and strong, and righteous, andmerciful, and the only and gracious King,   

{1:25} The only giver of all things, the only just, almighty, andeverlasting, thou that deliverest Israel from all trouble, and didstchoose the fathers, and sanctify them:   

{1:26} Receive the sacrifice for thy whole people Israel, andpreserve thine own portion, and sanctify it.   

{1:27} Gather those together that are scattered from us, deliverthem that serve among the heathen, look upon them that are despised andabhorred, and let the heathen know that thou art our God.   

{1:28} Punish them that oppress us, and with pride do us wrong.   

{1:29} Plant thy people again in thy holy place, as Moses hathspoken.   

{1:30} And the priests sung psalms of thanksgiving.   

{1:31} Now when the sacrifice was consumed, Neemias commanded thewater that was left to be poured on the great stones.   

{1:32} When this was done, there was kindled a flame: but it wasconsumed by the light that shined from the altar.   

{1:33} So when this matter was known, it was told the king ofPersia, that in the place, where the priests that were led away had hidthe fire, there appeared water, and that Neemias had purified thesacrifices therewith.   

{1:34} Then the king, inclosing the place, made it holy, after hehad tried the matter.   

{1:35} And the king took many gifts, and bestowed thereof on thosewhom he would gratify.   

{1:36} And Neemias called this thing Naphthar, which is as much asto say, a cleansing: but many men call it Nephi.   

{2:1} It is also found in the records, that Jeremy the prophetcommanded them that were carried away to take of the fire, as it hathbeen signified:   

{2:2} And how that the prophet, having given them the law, chargedthem not to forget the commandments of the Lord, and that they shouldnot err in their minds, when they see images of silver and gold, withtheir ornaments.   

{2:3} And with other such speeches exhorted he them, that the lawshould not depart from their hearts.   

{2:4} It was also contained in the same writing, that the prophet,being warned of God, commanded the tabernacle and the ark to go withhim, as he went forth into the mountain, where Moses climbed up, andsaw the heritage of God.   

{2:5} And when Jeremy came thither, he found an hollow cave, whereinhe laid the tabernacle, and the ark, and the altar of incense, and sostopped the door.   

{2:6} And some of those that followed him came to mark the way, butthey could not find it.   

{2:7} Which when Jeremy perceived, he blamed them, saying, As forthat place, it shall be unknown until the time that God gather hispeople again together, and receive them unto mercy.   

{2:8} Then shall the Lord shew them these things, and the glory ofthe Lord shall appear, and the cloud also, as it was shewed underMoses, and as when Solomon desired that the place might be honourablysanctified.   

{2:9} It was also declared, that he being wise offered the sacrificeof dedication, and of the finishing of the temple.   

{2:10} And as when Moses prayed unto the Lord, the fire came downfrom heaven, and consumed the sacrifices: even so prayed Solomon also,and the fire came down from heaven, and consumed the burnt offerings.   

{2:11} And Moses said, Because the sin offering was not to be eaten,it was consumed.   

{2:12} So Solomon kept those eight days.   

{2:13} The same things also were reported in the writings andcommentaries of Neemias; and how he founding a library gatheredtogether the acts of the kings, and the prophets, and of David, and theepistles of the kings concerning the holy gifts.   

{2:14} In like manner also Judas gathered together all those thingsthat were lost by reason of the war we had, and they remain with us,   

{2:15} Wherefore if ye have need thereof, send some to fetch themunto you.   

{2:16} Whereas we then are about to celebrate the purification, wehave written unto you, and ye shall do well, if ye keep the same days.   

{2:17} We hope also, that the God, that delivered all his people,and gave them all an heritage, and the kingdom, and the priesthood, andthe sanctuary,   

{2:18} As he promised in the law, will shortly have mercy upon us,and gather us together out of every land under heaven into the holyplace: for he hath delivered us out of great troubles, and hathpurified the place.   

{2:19} Now as concerning Judas Maccabeus, and his brethren, and thepurification of the great temple, and the dedication of the altar,   

{2:20} And the wars against Antiochus Epiphanes, and Eupator his son,   

{2:21} And the manifest signs that came from heaven unto those thatbehaved themselves manfully to their honour for Judaism: so that, beingbut a few, they overcame the whole country, and chased barbarousmultitudes,   

{2:22} And recovered again the temple renowned all the world over,and freed the city, and upheld the laws which were going down, the Lordbeing gracious unto them with all favour:   

{2:23} All these things, I say, being declared by Jason of Cyrene infive books, we will assay to abridge in one volume.   

{2:24} For considering the infinite number, and the difficulty whichthey find that desire to look into the narrations of the story, for thevariety of the matter,   

{2:25} We have been careful, that they that will read may havedelight, and that they that are desirous to commit to memory might haveease, and that all into whose hands it comes might have profit.   

{2:26} Therefore to us, that have taken upon us this painful labourof abridging, it was not easy, but a matter of sweat and watching;   

{2:27} Even as it is no ease unto him that prepareth a banquet, andseeketh the benefit of others: yet for the pleasuring of many we willundertake gladly this great pains;   

{2:28} Leaving to the author the exact handling of every particular,and labouring to follow the rules of an abridgement.   

{2:29} For as the master builder of a new house must care for thewhole building; but he that undertaketh to set it out, and paint it,must seek out fit things for the adorning thereof: even so I think itis with us.   

{2:30} To stand upon every point, and go over things at large, andto be curious in particulars, belongeth to the first author of thestory:   

{2:31} But to use brevity, and avoid much labouring of the work, isto be granted to him that will make an abridgment.   

{2:32} Here then will we begin the story: only adding thus much tothat which hath been said, that it is a foolish thing to make a longprologue, and to be short in the story itself.   

{3:1} Now when the holy city was inhabited with all peace, and thelaws were kept very well, because of the godliness of Onias the highpriest, and his hatred of wickedness,   

{3:2} It came to pass that even the kings themselves did honour theplace, and magnify the temple with their best gifts;   

{3:3} Insomuch that Seleucus of Asia of his own revenues bare allthe costs belonging to the service of the sacrifices.   

{3:4} But one Simon of the tribe of Benjamin, who was made governorof the temple, fell out with the high priest about disorder in the city.   

{3:5} And when he could not overcome Onias, he gat him to Apolloniusthe son of Thraseas, who then was governor of Celosyria and Phenice,   

{3:6} And told him that the treasury in Jerusalem was full ofinfinite sums of money, so that the multitude of their riches, whichdid not pertain to the account of the sacrifices, was innumerable, andthat it was possible to bring all into the king's hand.   

{3:7} Now when Apollonius came to the king, and had shewed him ofthe money whereof he was told, the king chose out Heliodorus histreasurer, and sent him with a commandment to bring him the foresaidmoney.   

{3:8} So forthwith Heliodorus took his journey; under a colour ofvisiting the cities of Celosyria and Phenice, but indeed to fulfil theking's purpose.   

{3:9} And when he was come to Jerusalem, and had been courteouslyreceived of the high priest of the city, he told him what intelligencewas given of the money, and declared wherefore he came, and asked ifthese things were so indeed.   

{3:10} Then the high priest told him that there was such money laidup for the relief of widows and fatherless children:   

{3:11} And that some of it belonged to Hircanus son of Tobias, a manof great dignity, and not as that wicked Simon had misinformed: the sumwhereof in all was four hundred talents of silver, and two hundred ofgold:   

{3:12} And that it was altogether impossible that such wrongs shouldbe done unto them, that had committed it to the holiness of the place,and to the majesty and inviolable sanctity of the temple, honoured overall the world.   

{3:13} But Heliodorus, because of the king's commandment given him,said, That in any wise it must be brought into the king's treasury.   

{3:14} So at the day which he appointed he entered in to order thismatter: wherefore there was no small agony throughout the whole city.   

{3:15} But the priests, prostrating themselves before the altar intheir priests' vestments, called unto heaven upon him that made a lawconcerning things given to he kept, that they should safely bepreserved for such as had committed them to be kept.   

{3:16} Then whoso had looked the high priest in the face, it wouldhave wounded his heart: for his countenance and the changing of hiscolour declared the inward agony of his mind.   

{3:17} For the man was so compassed with fear and horror of thebody, that it was manifest to them that looked upon him, what sorrow hehad now in his heart.   

{3:18} Others ran flocking out of their houses to the generalsupplication, because the place was like to come into contempt.   

{3:19} And the women, girt with sackcloth under their breasts,abounded in the streets, and the virgins that were kept in ran, some tothe gates, and some to the walls, and others looked out of the windows.   

{3:20} And all, holding their hands toward heaven, made supplication.   

{3:21} Then it would have pitied a man to see the falling down ofthe multitude of all sorts, and the fear of the high priest being insuch an agony.   

{3:22} They then called upon the Almighty Lord to keep the thingscommitted of trust safe and sure for those that had committed them.   

{3:23} Nevertheless Heliodorus executed that which was decreed.   

{3:24} Now as he was there present himself with his guard about thetreasury, the Lord of spirits, and the Prince of all power, caused agreat apparition, so that all that presumed to come in with him wereastonished at the power of God, and fainted, and were sore afraid.   

{3:25} For there appeared unto them an horse with a terrible riderupon him, and adorned with a very fair covering, and he ran fiercely,and smote at Heliodorus with his forefeet, and it seemed that he thatsat upon the horse had complete harness of gold.   

{3:26} Moreover two other young men appeared before him, notable instrength, excellent in beauty, and comely in apparel, who stood by himon either side; and scourged him continually, and gave him many sorestripes.   

{3:27} And Heliodorus fell suddenly unto the ground, and wascompassed with great darkness: but they that were with him took him up,and put him into a litter.   

{3:28} Thus him, that lately came with a great train and with allhis guard into the said treasury, they carried out, being unable tohelp himself with his weapons: and manifestly they acknowledged thepower of God.   

{3:29} For he by the hand of God was cast down, and lay speechlesswithout all hope of life.   

{3:30} But they praised the Lord, that had miraculously honoured hisown place: for the temple; which a little afore was full of fear andtrouble, when the Almighty Lord appeared, was filled with joy andgladness.   

{3:31} Then straightways certain of Heliodorus' friends prayedOnias, that he would call upon the most High to grant him his life, wholay ready to give up the ghost.   

{3:32} So the high priest, suspecting lest the king shouldmisconceive that some treachery had been done to Heliodorus by theJews, offered a sacrifice for the health of the man.   

{3:33} Now as the high priest was making an atonement, the sameyoung men in the same clothing appeared and stood beside Heliodorus,saying, Give Onias the high priest great thanks, insomuch as for hissake the Lord hath granted thee life:   

{3:34} And seeing that thou hast been scourged from heaven, declareunto all men the mighty power of God. And when they had spoken thesewords, they appeared no more.   

{3:35} So Heliodorus, after he had offered sacrifice unto the Lord,and made great vows unto him that had saved his life, and salutedOnias, returned with his host to the king.   

{3:36} Then testified he to all men the works of the great God,which he had seen with his eyes.   

{3:37} And when the king Heliodorus, who might be a fit man to besent yet once again to Jerusalem, he said,   

{3:38} If thou hast any enemy or traitor, send him thither, and thoushalt receive him well scourged, if he escape with his life: for inthat place, no doubt; there is an especial power of God.   

{3:39} For he that dwelleth in heaven hath his eye on that place,and defendeth it; and he beateth and destroyeth them that come to hurtit.   

{3:40} And the things concerning Heliodorus, and the keeping of thetreasury, fell out on this sort.   

{4:1} This Simon now, of whom we spake afore, having been a betrayerof the money, and of his country, slandered Onias, as if he haterrified Heliodorus, and been the worker of these evils.   

{4:2} Thus was he bold to call him a traitor, that had deserved wellof the city, and tendered his own nation, and was so zealous of thelaws.   

{4:3} But when their hatred went so far, that by one of Simon'sfaction murders were committed,   

{4:4} Onias seeing the danger of this contention, and thatApollonius, as being the governor of Celosyria and Phenice, did rage,and increase Simon's malice,   

{4:5} He went to the king, not to be an accuser of his countrymen,but seeking the good of all, both publick and private:   

{4:6} For he saw that it was impossible that the state shouldcontinue quiet, and Simon leave his folly, unless the king did lookthereunto.   

{4:7} But after the death of Seleucus, when Antiochus, calledEpiphanes, took the kingdom, Jason the brother of Onias labouredunderhand to be high priest,   

{4:8} Promising unto the king by intercession three hundred andthreescore talents of silver, and of another revenue eighty talents:   

{4:9} Beside this, he promised to assign an hundred and fifty more,if he might have licence to set him up a place for exercise, and forthe training up of youth in the fashions of the heathen, and to writethem of Jerusalem by the name of Antiochians.   

{4:10} Which when the king had granted, and he had gotten into hishand the rule he forthwith brought his own nation to Greekish fashion.   

{4:11} And the royal privileges granted of special favour to theJews by the means of John the father of Eupolemus, who went ambassadorto Rome for amity and aid, he took away; and putting down thegovernments which were according to the law, he brought up new customsagainst the law:   

{4:12} For he built gladly a place of exercise under the toweritself, and brought the chief young men under his subjection, and madethem wear a hat.   

{4:13} Now such was the height of Greek fashions, and increase ofheathenish manners, through the exceeding profaneness of Jason, thatungodly wretch, and no high priest;   

{4:14} That the priests had no courage to serve any more at thealtar, but despising the temple, and neglecting the sacrifices,hastened to be partakers of the unlawful allowance in the place ofexercise, after the game of Discus called them forth;   

{4:15} Not setting by the honours of their fathers, but liking theglory of the Grecians best of all.   

{4:16} By reason whereof sore calamity came upon them: for they hadthem to be their enemies and avengers, whose custom they followed soearnestly, and unto whom they desired to be like in all things.   

{4:17} For it is not a light thing to do wickedly against the lawsof God: but the time following shall declare these things.   

{4:18} Now when the game that was used every faith year was kept atTyrus, the king being present,   

{4:19} This ungracious Jason sent special messengers from Jerusalem,who were Antiochians, to carry three hundred drachms of silver to thesacrifice of Hercules, which even the bearers thereof thought fit notto bestow upon the sacrifice, because it was not convenient, but to bereserved for other charges.   

{4:20} This money then, in regard of the sender, was appointed toHercules' sacrifice; but because of the bearers thereof, it wasemployed to the making of gallies.   

{4:21} Now when Apollonius the son of Menestheus was sent into Egyptfor the coronation of king Ptolemeus Philometor, Antiochus,understanding him not to be well affected to his affairs, provided forhis own safety: whereupon he came to Joppa, and from thence toJerusalem:   

{4:22} Where he was honourably received of Jason, and of the city,and was brought in with torch alight, and with great shoutings: and soafterward went with his host unto Phenice.   

{4:23} Three years afterward Jason sent Menelaus, the aforesaidSimon's brother, to bear the money unto the king, and to put him inmind of certain necessary matters.   

{4:24} But he being brought to the presence of the king, when he hadmagnified him for the glorious appearance of his power, got thepriesthood to himself, offering more than Jason by three hundredtalents of silver.   

{4:25} So he came with the king's mandate, bringing nothing worthythe high priesthood, but having the fury of a cruel tyrant, and therage of a savage beast.   

{4:26} Then Jason, who had undermined his own brother, beingundermined by another, was compelled to flee into the country of theAmmonites.   

{4:27} So Menelaus got the principality: but as for the money thathe had promised unto the king, he took no good order for it, albeitSostratis the ruler of the castle required it:   

{4:28} For unto him appertained the gathering of the customs.Wherefore they were both called before the king.   

{4:29} Now Menelaus left his brother Lysimachus in his stead in thepriesthood; and Sostratus left Crates, who was governor of the Cyprians.   

{4:30} While those things were in doing, they of Tarsus and Mallosmade insurrection, because they were given to the king's concubine,called Antiochus.   

{4:31} Then came the king in all haste to appease matters, leavingAndronicus, a man in authority, for his deputy.   

{4:32} Now Menelaus, supposing that he had gotten a convenient time,stole certain vessels of gold out of the temple, and gave some of themto Andronicus, and some he sold into Tyrus and the cities round about.   

{4:33} Which when Onias knew of a surety, he reproved him, andwithdrew himself into a sanctuary at Daphne, that lieth by Antiochia.   

{4:34} Wherefore Menelaus, taking Andronicus apart, prayed, him toget Onias into his hands; who being persuaded thereunto, and coming toOnias in deceit, gave him his right hand with oaths; and though he weresuspected by him, yet persuaded he him to come forth of the sanctuary:whom forthwith he shut up without regard of justice.   

{4:35} For the which cause not only the Jews, but many also of othernations, took great indignation, and were much grieved for the unjustmurder of the man.   

{4:36} And when the king was come again from the places aboutCilicia, the Jews that were in the city, and certain of the Greeks thatabhorred the fact also, complained because Onias was slain withoutcause.   

{4:37} Therefore Antiochus was heartily sorry, and moved to pity,and wept, because of the sober and modest behaviour of him that wasdead.   

{4:38} And being kindled with anger, forthwith he took awayAndronicus his purple, and rent off his clothes, and leading himthrough the whole city unto that very place, where he had committedimpiety against Onias, there slew he the cursed murderer. Thus the Lordrewarded him his punishment, as he had deserved.   

{4:39} Now when many sacrileges had been committed in the city byLysimachus with the consent of Menelaus, and the fruit thereof wasspread abroad, the multitude gathered themselves together againstLysimachus, many vessels of gold being already carried away.   

{4:40} Whereupon the common people rising, and being filled withrage, Lysimachus armed about three thousand men, and began first tooffer violence; one Auranus being the leader, a man far gone in years,and no less in folly.   

{4:41} They then seeing the attempt of Lysimachus, some of themcaught stones, some clubs, others taking handfuls of dust, that wasnext at hand, cast them all together upon Lysimachus, and those thatset upon them.   

{4:42} Thus many of them they wounded, and some they struck to theground, and all of them they forced to flee: but as for thechurchrobber himself, him they killed beside the treasury.   

{4:43} Of these matters therefore there was an accusation laidagainst Menelaus.   

{4:44} Now when the king came to Tyrus, three men that were sentfrom the senate pleaded the cause before him:   

{4:45} But Menelaus, being now convicted, promised Ptolemee the sonof Dorymenes to give him much money, if he would pacify the king towardhim.   

{4:46} Whereupon Ptolemee taking the king aside into a certaingallery, as it were to take the air, brought him to be of another mind:   

{4:47} Insomuch that he discharged Menelaus from the accusations,who notwithstanding was cause of all the mischief: and those poor men,who, if they had told their cause, yea, before the Scythians, shouldhave been judged innocent, them he condemned to death.   

{4:48} Thus they that followed the matter for the city, and for thepeople, and for the holy vessels, did soon suffer unjust punishment.   

{4:49} Wherefore even they of Tyrus, moved with hatred of thatwicked deed, caused them to be honourably buried.   

{4:50} And so through the covetousness of them that were of powerMenelaus remained still in authority, increasing in malice, and being agreat traitor to the citizens.   

{5:1} About the same time Antiochus prepared his second voyage intoEgypt:   

{5:2} And then it happened, that through all the city, for the spacealmost of forty days, there were seen horsemen running in the air, incloth of gold, and armed with lances, like a band of soldiers,   

{5:3} And troops of horsemen in array, encountering and running oneagainst another, with shaking of shields, and multitude of pikes, anddrawing of swords, and casting of darts, and glittering of goldenornaments, and harness of all sorts.   

{5:4} Wherefore every man prayed that that apparition might turn togood.   

{5:5} Now when there was gone forth a false rumour, as thoughAntiochus had been dead, Jason took at the least a thousand men, andsuddenly made an assault upon the city; and they that were upon thewalls being put back, and the city at length taken, Menelaus fled intothe castle:   

{5:6} But Jason slew his own citizens without mercy, not consideringthat to get the day of them of his own nation would be a most unhappyday for him; but thinking they had been his enemies, and not hiscountrymen, whom he conquered.   

{5:7} Howbeit for all this he obtained not the principality, but atthe last received shame for the reward of his treason, and fled againinto the country of the Ammonites.   

{5:8} In the end therefore he had an unhappy return, being accusedbefore Aretas the king of the Arabians, fleeing from city to city,pursued of all men, hated as a forsaker of the laws, and being had inabomination as an open enemy of his country and countrymen, he was castout into Egypt.   

{5:9} Thus he that had driven many out of their country perished ina strange land, retiring to the Lacedemonians, and thinking there tofind succour by reason of his kindred:   

{5:10} And he that had cast out many unburied had none to mourn forhim, nor any solemn funerals at all, nor sepulchre with his fathers.   

{5:11} Now when this that was done came to the king's car, hethought that Judea had revolted: whereupon removing out of Egypt in afurious mind, he took the city by force of arms,   

{5:12} And commanded his men of war not to spare such as they met,and to slay such as went up upon the houses.   

{5:13} Thus there was killing of young and old, making away of men,women, and children, slaying of virgins and infants.   

{5:14} And there were destroyed within the space of three whole daysfourscore thousand, whereof forty thousand were slain in the conflict;and no fewer sold than slain.   

{5:15} Yet was he not content with this, but presumed to go into themost holy temple of all the world; Menelaus, that traitor to the laws,and to his own country, being his guide:   

{5:16} And taking the holy vessels with polluted hands, and withprofane hands pulling down the things that were dedicated by otherkings to the augmentation and glory and honour of the place, he gavethem away.   

{5:17} And so haughty was Antiochus in mind, that he considered notthat the Lord was angry for a while for the sins of them that dwelt inthe city, and therefore his eye was not upon the place.   

{5:18} For had they not been formerly wrapped in many sins, thisman, as soon as he had come, had forthwith been scourged, and put backfrom his presumption, as Heliodorus was, whom Seleucus the king sent toview the treasury.   

{5:19} Nevertheless God did not choose the people for the place'ssake, but the place far the people's sake.   

{5:20} And therefore the place itself, that was partaker with themof the adversity that happened to the nation, did afterward communicatein the benefits sent from the Lord: and as it was forsaken in the wrathof the Almighty, so again, the great Lord being reconciled, it was setup with all glory.   

{5:21} So when Antiochus had carried out of the temple a thousandand eight hundred talents, he departed in all haste unto Antiochia,weening in his pride to make the land navigable, and the sea passableby foot: such was the haughtiness of his mind.   

{5:22} And he left governors to vex the nation: at Jerusalem,Philip, for his country a Phrygian, and for manners more barbarous thanhe that set him there;   

{5:23} And at Garizim, Andronicus; and besides, Menelaus, who worsethan all the rest bare an heavy hand over the citizens, having amalicious mind against his countrymen the Jews.   

{5:24} He sent also that detestable ringleader Apollonius with anarmy of two and twenty thousand, commanding him to slay all those thatwere in their best age, and to sell the women and the younger sort:   

{5:25} Who coming to Jerusalem, and pretending peace, did forbeartill the holy day of the sabbath, when taking the Jews keeping holyday, he commanded his men to arm themselves.   

{5:26} And so he slew all them that were gone to the celebrating ofthe sabbath, and running through the city with weapons slew greatmultitudes.   

{5:27} But Judas Maccabeus with nine others, or thereabout, withdrewhimself into the wilderness, and lived in the mountains after themanner of beasts, with his company, who fed on herbs continually, lestthey should be partakers of the pollution.   

{6:1} Not long after this the king sent an old man of Athens tocompel the Jews to depart from the laws of their fathers, and not tolive after the laws of God:   

{6:2} And to pollute also the temple in Jerusalem, and to call itthe temple of Jupiter Olympius; and that in Garizim, of Jupiter theDefender of strangers, as they did desire that dwelt in the place.   

{6:3} The coming in of this mischief was sore and grievous to thepeople:   

{6:4} For the temple was filled with riot and revelling by theGentiles, who dallied with harlots, and had to do with women within thecircuit of the holy places, and besides that brought in things thatwere not lawful.   

{6:5} The altar also was filled with profane things, which the lawforbiddeth.   

{6:6} Neither was it lawful for a man to keep sabbath days orancient fasts, or to profess himself at all to be a Jew.   

{6:7} And in the day of the king's birth every month they werebrought by bitter constraint to eat of the sacrifices; and when thefast of Bacchus was kept, the Jews were compelled to go in processionto Bacchus, carrying ivy.   

{6:8} Moreover there went out a decree to the neighbour cities ofthe heathen, by the suggestion of Ptolemee, against the Jews, that theyshould observe the same fashions, and be partakers of their sacrifices:   

{6:9} And whoso would not conform themselves to the manners of theGentiles should be put to death. Then might a man have seen the presentmisery.   

{6:10} For there were two women brought, who had circumcised theirchildren; whom when they had openly led round about the city, the babeshanding at their breasts, they cast them down headlong from the wall.   

{6:11} And others, that had run together into caves near by, to keepthe sabbath day secretly, being discovered by Philip, were all burnttogether, because they made a conscience to help themselves for thehonour of the most sacred day.   

{6:12} Now I beseech those that read this book, that they be notdiscouraged for these calamities, but that they judge those punishmentsnot to be for destruction, but for a chastening of our nation.   

{6:13} For it is a token of his great goodness, when wicked doersare not suffered any long time, but forthwith punished.   

{6:14} For not as with other nations, whom the Lord patientlyforbeareth to punish, till they be come to the fulness of their sins,so dealeth he with us,   

{6:15} Lest that, being come to the height of sin, afterwards heshould take vengeance of us.   

{6:16} And therefore he never withdraweth his mercy from us: andthough he punish with adversity, yet doth he never forsake his people.   

{6:17} But let this that we at spoken be for a warning unto us. Andnow will we come to the declaring of the matter in a few words.   

{6:18} Eleazar, one of the principal scribes, an aged man, and of awell favoured countenance, was constrained to open his mouth, and toeat swine's flesh.   

{6:19} But he, choosing rather to die gloriously, than to livestained with such an abomination, spit it forth, and came of his ownaccord to the torment,   

{6:20} As it behoved them to come, that are resolute to stand outagainst such things, as are not lawful for love of life to be tasted.   

{6:21} But they that had the charge of that wicked feast, for theold acquaintance they had with the man, taking him aside, besought himto bring flesh of his own provision, such as was lawful for him to use,and make as if he did eat of the flesh taken from the sacrificecommanded by the king;   

{6:22} That in so doing he might be delivered from death, and forthe old friendship with them find favour.   

{6:23} But he began to consider discreetly, and as became his age,and the excellency of his ancient years, and the honour of his grayhead, whereon was come, and his most honest education from a child, orrather the holy law made and given by God: therefore he answeredaccordingly, and willed them straightways to send him to the grave.   

{6:24} For it becometh not our age, said he, in any wise todissemble, whereby many young persons might think that Eleazar, beingfourscore years old and ten, were now gone to a strange religion;   

{6:25} And so they through mine hypocrisy, and desire to live alittle time and a moment longer, should be deceived by me, and I get astain to mine old age, and make it abominable.   

{6:26} For though for the present time I should be delivered fromthe punishment of men: yet should I not escape the hand of theAlmighty, neither alive, nor dead.   

{6:27} Wherefore now, manfully changing this life, I will shewmyself such an one as mine age requireth,   

{6:28} And leave a notable example to such as be young to diewillingly and courageously for the honourable and holy laws. And whenhe had said these words, immediately he went to the torment:   

{6:29} They that led him changing the good will they bare him alittle before into hatred, because the foresaid speeches proceeded, asthey thought, from a desperate mind.   

{6:30} But when he was ready to die with stripes, he groaned, andsaid, It is manifest unto the Lord, that hath the holy knowledge, thatwhereas I might have been delivered from death, I now endure sore painsin body by being beaten: but in soul am well content to suffer thesethings, because I fear him.   

{6:31} And thus this man died, leaving his death for an example of anoble courage, and a memorial of virtue, not only unto young men, butunto all his nation.   

{7:1} It came to pass also, that seven brethren with their motherwere taken, and compelled by the king against the law to taste swine'sflesh, and were tormented with scourges and whips.   

{7:2} But one of them that spake first said thus, What wouldest thouask or learn of us? we are ready to die, rather than to transgress thelaws of our fathers.   

{7:3} Then the king, being in a rage, commanded pans and caldrons tobe made hot:   

{7:4} Which forthwith being heated, he commanded to cut out thetongue of him that spake first, and to cut off the utmost parts of hisbody, the rest of his brethren and his mother looking on.   

{7:5} Now when he was thus maimed in all his members, he commandedhim being yet alive to be brought to the fire, and to be fried in thepan: and as the vapour of the pan was for a good space dispersed, theyexhorted one another with the mother to die manfully, saying thus,   

{7:6} The Lord God looketh upon us, and in truth hath comfort in us,as Moses in his song, which witnessed to their faces, declared, saying,And he shall be comforted in his servants.   

{7:7} So when the first was dead after this number, they brought thesecond to make him a mocking stock: and when they had pulled off theskin of his head with the hair, they asked him, Wilt thou eat, beforethou be punished throughout every member of thy body?   

{7:8} But he answered in his own language, and said, No. Whereforehe also received the next torment in order, as the former did.   

{7:9} And when he was at the last gasp, he said, Thou like a furytakest us out of this present life, but the King of the world shallraise us up, who have died for his laws, unto everlasting life.   

{7:10} After him was the third made a mocking stock: and when he wasrequired, he put out his tongue, and that right soon, holding forth hishands manfully.   

{7:11} And said courageously, These I had from heaven; and for hislaws I despise them; and from him I hope to receive them again.   

{7:12} Insomuch that the king, and they that were with him,marvelled at the young man's courage, for that he nothing regarded thepains.   

{7:13} Now when this man was dead also, they tormented and mangledthe fourth in like manner.   

{7:14} So when he was ready to die he said thus, It is good, beingput to death by men, to look for hope from God to be raised up again byhim: as for thee, thou shalt have no resurrection to life.   

{7:15} Afterward they brought the fifth also, and mangled him.   

{7:16} Then looked he unto the king, and said, Thou hast power overmen, thou art corruptible, thou doest what thou wilt; yet think notthat our nation is forsaken of God;   

{7:17} But abide a while, and behold his great power, how he willtorment thee and thy seed.   

{7:18} After him also they brought the sixth, who being ready to diesaid, Be not deceived without cause: for we suffer these things forourselves, having sinned against our God: therefore marvellous thingsare done unto us.   

{7:19} But think not thou, that takest in hand to strive againstGod, that thou shalt escape unpunished.   

{7:20} But the mother was marvellous above all, and worthy ofhonourable memory: for when she saw her seven sons slain within thespace of one day, she bare it with a good courage, because of the hopethat she had in the Lord.   

{7:21} Yea, she exhorted every one of them in her own language,filled with courageous spirits; and stirring up her womanish thoughtswith a manly stomach, she said unto them,   

{7:22} I cannot tell how ye came into my womb: for I neither gaveyou breath nor life, neither was it I that formed the members of everyone of you;   

{7:23} But doubtless the Creator of the world, who formed thegeneration of man, and found out the beginning of all things, will alsoof his own mercy give you breath and life again, as ye now regard notyour own selves for his laws' sake.   

{7:24} Now Antiochus, thinking himself despised, and suspecting itto be a reproachful speech, whilst the youngest was yet alive, did notonly exhort him by words, but also assured him with oaths, that hewould make him both a rich and a happy man, if he would turn from thelaws of his fathers; and that also he would take him for his friend,and trust him with affairs.   

{7:25} But when the young man would in no case hearken unto him, theking called his mother, and exhorted her that she would counsel theyoung man to save his life.   

{7:26} And when he had exhorted her with many words, she promisedhim that she would counsel her son.   

{7:27} But she bowing herself toward him, laughing the cruel tyrantto scorn, spake in her country language on this manner; O my son, havepity upon me that bare thee nine months in my womb, and gave thee suchthree years, and nourished thee, and brought thee up unto this age, andendured the troubles of education.   

{7:28} I beseech thee, my son, look upon the heaven and the earth,and all that is therein, and consider that God made them of things thatwere not; and so was mankind made likewise.   

{7:29} Fear not this tormentor, but, being worthy of thy brethren,take thy death that I may receive thee again in mercy with thy brethren.   

{7:30} Whiles she was yet speaking these words, the young man said,Whom wait ye for? I will not obey the king's commandment: but I willobey the commandment of the law that was given unto our fathers byMoses.   

{7:31} And thou, that hast been the author of all mischief againstthe Hebrews, shalt not escape the hands of God.   

{7:32} For we suffer because of our sins.   

{7:33} And though the living Lord be angry with us a little whilefor our chastening and correction, yet shall he be at one again withhis servants.   

{7:34} But thou, O godless man, and of all other most wicked, be notlifted up without a cause, nor puffed up with uncertain hopes, liftingup thy hand against the servants of God:   

{7:35} For thou hast not yet escaped the judgment of Almighty God,who seeth all things.   

{7:36} For our brethren, who now have suffered a short pain, aredead under God's covenant of everlasting life: but thou, through thejudgment of God, shalt receive just punishment for thy pride.   

{7:37} But I, as my brethren, offer up my body and life for the lawsof our fathers, beseeching God that he would speedily be merciful untoour nation; and that thou by torments and plagues mayest confess, thathe alone is God;   

{7:38} And that in me and my brethren the wrath of the Almighty,which is justly brought upon our nation, may cease.   

{7:39} Than the king' being in a rage, handed him worse than all therest, and took it grievously that he was mocked.   

{7:40} So this man died undefiled, and put his whole trust in theLord.   

{7:41} Last of all after the sons the mother died.   

{7:42} Let this be enough now to have spoken concerning theidolatrous feasts, and the extreme tortures.   

{8:1} Then Judas Maccabeus, and they that were with him, wentprivily into the towns, and called their kinsfolks together, and tookunto them all such as continued in the Jews' religion, and assembledabout six thousand men.   

{8:2} And they called upon the Lord, that he would look upon thepeople that was trodden down of all; and also pity the temple profanedof ungodly men;   

{8:3} And that he would have compassion upon the city, sore defaced,and ready to be made even with the ground; and hear the blood thatcried unto him,   

{8:4} And remember the wicked slaughter of harmless infants, and theblasphemies committed against his name; and that he would shew hishatred against the wicked.   

{8:5} Now when Maccabeus had his company about him, he could not bewithstood by the heathen: for the wrath of the Lord was turned intomercy.   

{8:6} Therefore he came at unawares, and burnt up towns and cities,and got into his hands the most commodious places, and overcame and putto flight no small number of his enemies.   

{8:7} But specially took he advantage of the night for such privyattempts, insomuch that the fruit of his holiness was spread everywhere.   

{8:8} So when Philip saw that this man increased by little andlittle, and that things prospered with him still more and more, hewrote unto Ptolemeus, the governor of Celosyria and Phenice, to yieldmore aid to the king's affairs.   

{8:9} Then forthwith choosing Nicanor the son of Patroclus, one ofhis special friends, he sent him with no fewer than twenty thousand ofall nations under him, to root out the whole generation of the Jews;and with him he joined also Gorgias a captain, who in matters of warhad great experience.   

{8:10} So Nicanor undertook to make so much money of the captiveJews, as should defray the tribute of two thousand talents, which theking was to pay to the Romans.   

{8:11} Wherefore immediately he sent to the cities upon the seacoast, proclaiming a sale of the captive Jews, and promising that theyshould have fourscore and ten bodies for one talent, not expecting thevengeance that was to follow upon him from the Almighty God.   

{8:12} Now when word was brought unto Judas of Nicanor's coming, andhe had imparted unto those that were with him that the army was at hand,   

{8:13} They that were fearful, and distrusted the justice of God,fled, and conveyed themselves away.   

{8:14} Others sold all that they had left, and withal besought theLord to deliver them, sold by the wicked Nicanor before they mettogether:   

{8:15} And if not for their own sakes, yet for the covenants he hadmade with their fathers, and for his holy and glorious name's sake, bywhich they were called.   

{8:16} So Maccabeus called his men together unto the number of sixthousand, and exhorted them not to be stricken with terror of theenemy, nor to fear the great multitude of the heathen, who came wronglyagainst them; but to fight manfully,   

{8:17} And to set before their eyes the injury that they hadunjustly done to the holy place, and the cruel handling of the city,whereof they made a mockery, and also the taking away of the governmentof their forefathers:   

{8:18} For they, said he, trust in their weapons and boldness; butour confidence is in the Almighty who at a beck can cast down both themthat come against us, and also all the world.   

{8:19} Moreover, he recounted unto them what helps their forefathershad found, and how they were delivered, when under Sennacherib anhundred fourscore and five thousand perished.   

{8:20} And he told them of the battle that they had in Babylon withthe Galatians, how they came but eight thousand in all to the business,with four thousand Macedonians, and that the Macedonians beingperplexed, the eight thousand destroyed an hundred and twenty thousandbecause of the help that they had from heaven, and so received a greatbooty.   

{8:21} Thus when he had made them bold with these words, and readyto die for the law and the country, he divided his army into four parts;   

{8:22} And joined with himself his own brethren, leaders of eachband, to wit Simon, and Joseph, and Jonathan, giving each one fifteenhundred men.   

{8:23} Also he appointed Eleazar to read the holy book: and when hehad given them this watchword, The help of God; himself leading thefirst band,   

{8:24} And by the help of the Almighty they slew above nine thousandof their enemies, and wounded and maimed the most part of Nicanor'shost, and so put all to flight;   

{8:25} And took their money that came to buy them, and pursued themfar: but lacking time they returned:   

{8:26} For it was the day before the sabbath, and therefore theywould no longer pursue them.   

{8:27} So when they had gathered their armour together, and spoiledtheir enemies, they occupied themselves about the sabbath, yieldingexceeding praise and thanks to the Lord, who had preserved them untothat day, which was the beginning of mercy distilling upon them.   

{8:28} And after the sabbath, when they had given part of the spoilsto the maimed, and the widows, and orphans, the residue they dividedamong themselves and their servants.   

{8:29} When this was done, and they had made a common supplication,they besought the merciful Lord to be reconciled with his servants forever.   

{8:30} Moreover of those that were with Timotheus and Bacchides, whofought against them, they slew above twenty thousand, and very easilygot high and strong holds, and divided among themselves many spoilsmore, and made the maimed, orphans, widows, yea, and the aged also,equal in spoils with themselves.   

{8:31} And when they had gathered their armour together, they laidthem up all carefully in convenient places, and the remnant of thespoils they brought to Jerusalem.   

{8:32} They slew also Philarches, that wicked person, who was withTimotheus, and had annoyed the Jews many ways.   

{8:33} Furthermore at such time as they kept the feast for thevictory in their country they burnt Callisthenes, that had set fireupon the holy gates, who had fled into a little house; and so hereceived a reward meet for his wickedness.   

{8:34} As for that most ungracious Nicanor, who had brought athousand merchants to buy the Jews,   

{8:35} He was through the help of the Lord brought down by them, ofwhom he made least account; and putting off his glorious apparel, anddischarging his company, he came like a fugitive servant through themidland unto Antioch having very great dishonour, for that his host wasdestroyed.   

{8:36} Thus he, that took upon him to make good to the Romans theirtribute by means of captives in Jerusalem, told abroad, that the Jewshad God to fight for them, and therefore they could not be hurt,because they followed the laws that he gave them.   

{9:1} About that time came Antiochus with dishonour out of thecountry of Persia   

{9:2} For he had entered the city called Persepolis, and went aboutto rob the temple, and to hold the city; whereupon the multituderunning to defend themselves with their weapons put them to flight; andso it happened, that Antiochus being put to flight of the inhabitantsreturned with shame.   

{9:3} Now when he came to Ecbatane, news was brought him what hadhappened unto Nicanor and Timotheus.   

{9:4} Then swelling with anger. he thought to avenge upon the Jewsthe disgrace done unto him by those that made him flee. Thereforecommanded he his chariotman to drive without ceasing, and to dispatchthe journey, the judgment of God now following him. For he had spokenproudly in this sort, That he would come to Jerusalem and make it acommon burying place of the Jews.   

{9:5} But the Lord Almighty, the God of Isreal, smote him with anincurable and invisible plague: or as soon as he had spoken thesewords, a pain of the bowels that was remediless came upon him, and soretorments of the inner parts;   

{9:6} And that most justly: for he had tormented other men's bowelswith many and strange torments.   

{9:7} Howbeit he nothing at all ceased from his bragging, but stillwas filled with pride, breathing out fire in his rage against the Jews,and commanding to haste the journey: but it came to pass that he felldown from his chariot, carried violently; so that having a sore fall,all the members of his body were much pained.   

{9:8} And thus he that a little afore thought he might command thewaves of the sea, (so proud was he beyond the condition of man) andweigh the high mountains in a balance, was now cast on the ground, andcarried in an horselitter, shewing forth unto all the manifest power ofGod.   

{9:9} So that the worms rose up out of the body of this wicked man,and whiles he lived in sorrow and pain, his flesh fell away, and thefilthiness of his smell was noisome to all his army.   

{9:10} And the man, that thought a little afore he could reach tothe stars of heaven, no man could endure to carry for his intolerablestink.   

{9:11} Here therefore, being plagued, he began to leave off hisgreat pride, and to come to the knowledge of himself by the scourge ofGod, his pain increasing every moment.   

{9:12} And when he himself could not abide his own smell, he saidthese words, It is meet to be subject unto God, and that a man that ismortal should not proudly think of himself if he were God.   

{9:13} This wicked person vowed also unto the Lord, who now no morewould have mercy upon him, saying thus,   

{9:14} That the holy city (to the which he was going in haste to layit even with the ground, and to make it a common buryingplace,) hewould set at liberty:   

{9:15} And as touching the Jews, whom he had judged not worthy somuch as to be buried, but to be cast out with their children to bedevoured of the fowls and wild beasts, he would make them all equals tothe citizens of Athens:   

{9:16} And the holy temple, which before he had spoiled, he wouldgarnish with goodly gifts, and restore all the holy vessels with manymore, and out of his own revenue defray the charges belonging to thesacrifices:   

{9:17} Yea, and that also he would become a Jew himself, and gothrough all the world that was inhabited, and declare the power of God.   

{9:18} But for all this his pains would not cease: for the justjudgment of God was come upon him: therefore despairing of his health,he wrote unto the Jews the letter underwritten, containing the form ofa supplication, after this manner:   

{9:19} Antiochus, king and governor, to the good Jews his citizenswisheth much joy, health, and prosperity:   

{9:20} If ye and your children fare well, and your affairs be toyour contentment, I give very great thanks to God, having my hope inheaven.   

{9:21} As for me, I was weak, or else I would have remembered kindlyyour honour and good will returning out of Persia, and being taken witha grievous disease, I thought it necessary to care for the commonsafety of all:   

{9:22} Not distrusting mine health, but having great hope to escapethis sickness.   

{9:23} But considering that even my father, at what time he led anarmy into the high countries. appointed a successor,   

{9:24} To the end that, if any thing fell out contrary toexpectation, or if any tidings were brought that were grievous, they ofthe land, knowing to whom the state was left, might not be troubled:   

{9:25} Again, considering how that the princes that are borderersand neighbours unto my kingdom wait for opportunities, and expect whatshall be the event. I have appointed my son Antiochus king, whom Ioften committed and commended unto many of you, when I went up into thehigh provinces; to whom I have written as followeth:   

{9:26} Therefore I pray and request you to remember the benefitsthat I have done unto you generally, and in special, and that every manwill be still faithful to me and my son.   

{9:27} For I am persuaded that he understanding my mind willfavourably and graciously yield to your desires.   

{9:28} Thus the murderer and blasphemer having suffered mostgrievously, as he entreated other men, so died he a miserable death ina strange country in the mountains.   

{9:29} And Philip, that was brought up with him, carried away hisbody, who also fearing the son of Antiochus went into Egypt toPtolemeus Philometor.   

{10:1} Now Maccabeus and his company, the Lord guiding them,recovered the temple and the city:   

{10:2} But the altars which the heathen had built in the openstreet, and also the chapels, they pulled down.   

{10:3} And having cleansed the temple they made another altar, andstriking stones they took fire out of them, and offered a sacrificeafter two years, and set forth incense, and lights, and shewbread.   

{10:4} When that was done, they fell flat down, and besought theLord that they might come no more into such troubles; but if theysinned any more against him, that he himself would chasten them withmercy, and that they might not be delivered unto the blasphemous andbarbarous nations.   

{10:5} Now upon the same day that the strangers profaned the temple,on the very same day it was cleansed again, even the five and twentiethday of the same month, which is Casleu.   

{10:6} And they kept the eight days with gladness, as in the feastof the tabernacles, remembering that not long afore they had held thefeast of the tabernacles, when as they wandered in the mountains anddens like beasts.   

{10:7} Therefore they bare branches, and fair boughs, and palmsalso, and sang psalms unto him that had given them good success incleansing his place.   

{10:8} They ordained also by a common statute and decree, That everyyear those days should be kept of the whole nation of the Jews.   

{10:9} And this was the end of Antiochus, called Epiphanes.   

{10:10} Now will we declare the acts of Antiochus Eupator, who wasthe son of this wicked man, gathering briefly the calamities of thewars.   

{10:11} So when he was come to the crown, he set one Lysias over theaffairs of his realm, and appointed him his chief governor of Celosyriaand Phenice.   

{10:12} For Ptolemeus, that was called Macron, choosing rather to dojustice unto the Jews for the wrong that had been done unto them,endeavoured to continue peace with them.   

{10:13} Whereupon being accused of the king's friends beforeEupator, and called traitor at every word because he had left Cyprus,that Philometor had committed unto him, and departed to AntiochusEpiphanes, and seeing that he was in no honourable place, he was sodiscouraged, that he poisoned himself and died.   

{10:14} But when Gorgias was governor of the holds, he hiredsoldiers, and nourished war continually with the Jews:   

{10:15} And therewithall the Idumeans, having gotten into theirhands the most commodious holds, kept the Jews occupied, and receivingthose that were banished from Jerusalem, they went about to nourish war.   

{10:16} Then they that were with Maccabeus made supplication, andbesought God that he would be their helper; and so they ran withviolence upon the strong holds of the Idumeans,   

{10:17} And assaulting them strongly, they won the holds, and keptoff all that fought upon the wall, and slew all that fell into theirhands, and killed no fewer than twenty thousand.   

{10:18} And because certain, who were no less than nine thousand,were fled together into two very strong castles, having all manner ofthings convenient to sustain the siege,   

{10:19} Maccabeus left Simon and Joseph, and Zaccheus also, and themthat were with him, who were enough to besiege them, and departedhimself unto those places which more needed his help.   

{10:20} Now they that were with Simon, being led with covetousness,were persuaded for money through certain of those that were in thecastle, and took seventy thousand drachms, and let some of them escape.   

{10:21} But when it was told Maccabeus what was done, he called thegovernors of the people together, and accused those men, that they hadsold their brethren for money, and set their enemies free to fightagainst them.   

{10:22} So he slew those that were found traitors, and immediatelytook the two castles.   

{10:23} And having good success with his weapons in all things hetook in hand, he slew in the two holds more than twenty thousand.   

{10:24} Now Timotheus, whom the Jews had overcome before, when hehad gathered a great multitude of foreign forces, and horses out ofAsia not a few, came as though he would take Jewry by force of arms.   

{10:25} But when he drew near, they that were with Maccabeus turnedthemselves to pray unto God, and sprinkled earth upon their heads, andgirded their loins with sackcloth,   

{10:26} And fell down at the foot of the altar, and besought him tobe merciful to them, and to be an enemy to their enemies, and anadversary to their adversaries, as the law declareth.   

{10:27} So after the prayer they took their weapons, and went onfurther from the city: and when they drew near to their enemies, theykept by themselves.   

{10:28} Now the sun being newly risen, they joined both together;the one part having together with their virtue their refuge also untothe Lord for a pledge of their success and victory: the other sidemaking their rage leader of their battle   

{10:29} But when the battle waxed strong, there appeared unto theenemies from heaven five comely men upon horses, with bridles of gold,and two of them led the Jews,   

{10:30} And took Maccabeus betwixt them, and covered him on everyside weapons, and kept him safe, but shot arrows and lightnings againstthe enemies: so that being confounded with blindness, and full oftrouble, they were killed.   

{10:31} And there were slain of footmen twenty thousand and fivehundred, and six hundred horsemen.   

{10:32} As for Timotheus himself, he fled into a very strong hold,called Gawra, where Chereas was governor.   

{10:33} But they that were with Maccabeus laid siege against thefortress courageously four days.   

{10:34} And they that were within, trusting to the strength of theplace, blasphemed exceedingly, and uttered wicked words.   

{10:35} Nevertheless upon the fifth day early twenty young men ofMaccabeus' company, inflamed with anger because of the blasphemies,assaulted the wall manly, and with a fierce courage killed all thatthey met withal.   

{10:36} Others likewise ascending after them, whiles they werebusied with them that were within, burnt the towers, and kindling firesburnt the blasphemers alive; and others broke open the gates, and,having received in the rest of the army, took the city,   

{10:37} And killed Timotheus, that was hid in a certain pit, andChereas his brother, with Apollophanes.   

{10:38} When this was done, they praised the Lord with psalms andthanksgiving, who had done so great things for Israel, and given themthe victory.   

{11:1} Not long after the, Lysias the king's protector and cousin,who also managed the affairs, took sore displeasure for the things thatwere done.   

{11:2} And when he had gathered about fourscore thousand with allthe horsemen, he came against the Jews, thinking to make the city anhabitation of the Gentiles,   

{11:3} And to make a gain of the temple, as of the other chapels ofthe heathen, and to set the high priesthood to sale every year:   

{11:4} Not at all considering the power of God but puffed up withhis ten thousands of footmen, and his thousands of horsemen, and hisfourscore elephants.   

{11:5} So he came to Judea, and drew near to Bethsura, which was astrong town, but distant from Jerusalem about five furlongs, and helaid sore siege unto it.   

{11:6} Now when they that were with Maccabeus heard that he besiegedthe holds, they and all the people with lamentation and tears besoughtthe Lord that he would send a good angel to deliver Israel.   

{11:7} Then Maccabeus himself first of all took weapons, exhortingthe other that they would jeopard themselves together with him to helptheir brethren: so they went forth together with a willing mind.   

{11:8} And as they were at Jerusalem, there appeared before them onhorseback one in white clothing, shaking his armour of gold.   

{11:9} Then they praised the merciful God all together, and tookheart, insomuch that they were ready not only to fight with men, butwith most cruel beasts, and to pierce through walls of iron.   

{11:10} Thus they marched forward in their armour, having an helperfrom heaven: for the Lord was merciful unto them   

{11:11} And giving a charge upon their enemies like lions, they sleweleven thousand footmen, and sixteen hundred horsemen, and put all theother to flight.   

{11:12} Many of them also being wounded escaped naked; and Lysiashimself fled away shamefully, and so escaped.   

{11:13} Who, as he was a man of understanding, casting with himselfwhat loss he had had, and considering that the Hebrews could not beovercome, because the Almighty God helped them, he sent unto them,   

{11:14} And persuaded them to agree to all reasonable conditions,and promised that he would persuade the king that he must needs be afriend unto them.   

{11:15} Then Maccabeus consented to all that Lysias desired, beingcareful of the common good; and whatsoever Maccabeus wrote unto Lysiasconcerning the Jews, the king granted it.   

{11:16} For there were letters written unto the Jews from Lysias tothis effect: Lysias unto the people of the Jews sendeth greeting:   

{11:17} John and Absolom, who were sent from you, delivered me thepetition subscribed, and made request for the performance of thecontents thereof.   

{11:18} Therefore what things soever were meet to be reported to theking, I have declared them, and he hath granted as much as might be.   

{11:19} And if then ye will keep yourselves loyal to the state,hereafter also will I endeavour to be a means of your good.   

{11:20} But of the particulars I have given order both to these andthe other that came from me, to commune with you.   

{11:21} Fare ye well. The hundred and eight and fortieth year, thefour and twentieth day of the month Dioscorinthius.   

{11:22} Now the king's letter contained these words: King Antiochusunto his brother Lysias sendeth greeting:   

{11:23} Since our father is translated unto the gods, our will is,that they that are in our realm live quietly, that every one may attendupon his own affairs.   

{11:24} We understand also that the Jews would not consent to ourfather, for to be brought unto the custom of the Gentiles, but hadrather keep their own manner of living: for the which cause theyrequire of us, that we should suffer them to live after their own laws.   

{11:25} Wherefore our mind is, that this nation shall be in rest,and we have determined to restore them their temple, that they may liveaccording to the customs of their forefathers.   

{11:26} Thou shalt do well therefore to send unto them, and grantthem peace, that when they are certified of our mind, they may be ofgood comfort, and ever go cheerfully about their own affairs.   

{11:27} And the letter of the king unto the nation of the Jews wasafter this manner: King Antiochus sendeth greeting unto the council,and the rest of the Jews:   

{11:28} If ye fare well, we have our desire; we are also in goodhealth.   

{11:29} Menelaus declared unto us, that your desire was to returnhome, and to follow your own business:   

{11:30} Wherefore they that will depart shall have safe conduct tillthe thirtieth day of Xanthicus with security.   

{11:31} And the Jews shall use their own kind of meats and laws, asbefore; and none of them any manner of ways shall be molested forthings ignorantly done.   

{11:32} I have sent also Menelaus, that he may comfort you.   

{11:33} Fare ye well. In the hundred forty and eighth year, and thefifteenth day of the month Xanthicus.   

{11:34} The Romans also sent unto them a letter containing thesewords: Quintus Memmius and Titus Manlius, ambassadors of the Romans,send greeting unto the people of the Jews.   

{11:35} Whatsoever Lysias the king's cousin hath granted, therewithwe also are well pleased.   

{11:36} But touching such things as he judged to be referred to theking, after ye have advised thereof, send one forthwith, that we maydeclare as it is convenient for you: for we are now going to Antioch.   

{11:37} Therefore send some with speed, that we may know what isyour mind.   

{11:38} Farewell. This hundred and eight and fortieth year, thefifteenth day of the month Xanthicus.   

{12:1} When these covenants were made, Lysias went unto the king,and the Jews were about their husbandry.   

{12:2} But of the governours of several places, Timotheus, andApollonius the son of Genneus, also Hieronymus, and Demophon, andbeside them Nicanor the governor of Cyprus, would not suffer them to bequiet and live in peace.   

{12:3} The men of Joppa also did such an ungodly deed: they prayedthe Jews that dwelt among them to go with their wives and children intothe boats which they had prepared, as though they had meant them nohurt.   

{12:4} Who accepted of it according to the common decree of thecity, as being desirous to live in peace, and suspecting nothing: butwhen they were gone forth into the deep, they drowned no less than twohundred of them.   

{12:5} When Judas heard of this cruelty done unto his countrymen, hecommanded those that were with him to make them ready.   

{12:6} And calling upon God the righteous Judge, he came againstthose murderers of his brethren, and burnt the haven by night, and setthe boats on fire, and those that fled thither he slew.   

{12:7} And when the town was shut up, he went backward, as if hewould return to root out all them of the city of Joppa.   

{12:8} But when he heard that the Jamnites were minded to do in likemanner unto the Jews that dwelt among them,   

{12:9} He came upon the Jamnites also by night, and set fire on thehaven and the navy, so that the light of the fire was seen at Jerusalemtwo hundred and forty furlongs off.   

{12:10} Now when they were gone from thence nine furlongs in theirjourney toward Timotheus, no fewer than five thousand men on foot andfive hundred horsemen of the Arabians set upon him.   

{12:11} Whereupon there was a very sore battle; but Judas' side bythe help of God got the victory; so that the Nomades of Arabia, beingovercome, besought Judas for peace, promising both to give him cattle,and to pleasure him otherwise.   

{12:12} Then Judas, thinking indeed that they would be profitable inmany things, granted them peace: whereupon they shook hands, and sothey departed to their tents.   

{12:13} He went also about to make a bridge to a certain strongcity, which was fenced about with walls, and inhabited by people ofdivers countries; and the name of it was Caspis.   

{12:14} But they that were within it put such trust in the strengthof the walls and provision of victuals, that they behaved themselvesrudely toward them that were with Judas, railing and blaspheming, anduttering such words as were not to be spoken.   

{12:15} Wherefore Judas with his company, calling upon the greatLord of the world, who without rams or engines of war did cast downJericho in the time of Joshua, gave a fierce assault against the walls,   

{12:16} And took the city by the will of God, and made unspeakableslaughters, insomuch that a lake two furlongs broad near adjoiningthereunto, being filled full, was seen running with blood.   

{12:17} Then departed they from thence seven hundred and fiftyfurlongs, and came to Characa unto the Jews that are called Tubieni.   

{12:18} But as for Timotheus, they found him not in the places: forbefore he had dispatched any thing, he departed from thence, havingleft a very strong garrison in a certain hold.   

{12:19} Howbeit Dositheus and Sosipater, who were of Maccabeus'captains, went forth, and slew those that Timotheus had left in thefortress, above ten thousand men.   

{12:20} And Maccabeus ranged his army by bands, and set them overthe bands, and went against Timotheus, who had about him an hundred andtwenty thousand men of foot, and two thousand and five hundred horsemen.   

{12:21} Now when Timotheus had knowledge of Judas' coming, he sentthe women and children and the other baggage unto a fortress calledCarnion: for the town was hard to besiege, and uneasy to come unto, byreason of the straitness of all the places.   

{12:22} But when Judas his first band came in sight, the enemies,being smitten with fear and terror through the appearing of him whoseeth all things, fled amain, one running into this way, another thatway, so as that they were often hurt of their own men, and wounded withthe points of their own swords.   

{12:23} Judas also was very earnest in pursuing them, killing thosewicked wretches, of whom he slew about thirty thousand men.   

{12:24} Moreover Timotheus himself fell into the hands of Dositheusand Sosipater, whom he besought with much craft to let him go with hislife, because he had many of the Jews' parents, and the brethren ofsome of them, who, if they put him to death, should not be regarded.   

{12:25} So when he had assured them with many words that he wouldrestore them without hurt, according to the agreement, they let him gofor the saving of their brethren.   

{12:26} Then Maccabeus marched forth to Carnion, and to the templeof Atargatis, and there he slew five and twenty thousand persons.   

{12:27} And after he had put to flight and destroyed them, Judasremoved the host toward Ephron, a strong city, wherein Lysias abode,and a great multitude of divers nations, and the strong young men keptthe walls, and defended them mightily: wherein also was great provisionof engines and darts.   

{12:28} But when Judas and his company had called upon Almighty God,who with his power breaketh the strength of his enemies, they won thecity, and slew twenty and five thousand of them that were within,   

{12:29} From thence they departed to Scythopolis, which lieth sixhundred furlongs from Jerusalem,   

{12:30} But when the Jews that dwelt there had testified that theScythopolitans dealt lovingly with them, and entreated them kindly inthe time of their adversity;   

{12:31} They gave them thanks, desiring them to be friendly stillunto them: and so they came to Jerusalem, the feast of the weeksapproaching.   

{12:32} And after the feast, called Pentecost, they went forthagainst Gorgias the governor of Idumea,   

{12:33} Who came out with three thousand men of foot and fourhundred horsemen.   

{12:34} And it happened that in their fighting together a few of theJews were slain.   

{12:35} At which time Dositheus, one of Bacenor's company, who wason horseback, and a strong man, was still upon Gorgias, and taking holdof his coat drew him by force; and when he would have taken that cursedman alive, a horseman of Thracia coming upon him smote off hisshoulder, so that Gorgias fled unto Marisa.   

{12:36} Now when they that were with Gorgias had fought long, andwere weary, Judas called upon the Lord, that he would shew himself tobe their helper and leader of the battle.   

{12:37} And with that he began in his own language, and sung psalmswith a loud voice, and rushing unawares upon Gorgias' men, he put themto flight.   

{12:38} So Judas gathered his host, and came into the city ofOdollam, And when the seventh day came, they purified themselves, asthe custom was, and kept the sabbath in the same place.   

{12:39} And upon the day following, as the use had been, Judas andhis company came to take up the bodies of them that were slain, and tobury them with their kinsmen in their fathers' graves.   

{12:40} Now under the coats of every one that was slain they foundthings consecrated to the idols of the Jamnites, which is forbidden theJews by the law. Then every man saw that this was the cause whereforethey were slain.   

{12:41} All men therefore praising the Lord, the righteous Judge,who had opened the things that were hid,   

{12:42} Betook themselves unto prayer, and besought him that the sincommitted might wholly be put out of remembrance. Besides, that nobleJudas exhorted the people to keep themselves from sin, forsomuch asthey saw before their eyes the things that came to pass for the sins ofthose that were slain.   

{12:43} And when he had made a gathering throughout the company tothe sum of two thousand drachms of silver, he sent it to Jerusalem tooffer a sin offering, doing therein very well and honestly, in that hewas mindful of the resurrection:   

{12:44} For if he had not hoped that they that were slain shouldhave risen again, it had been superfluous and vain to pray for the dead.   

{12:45} And also in that he perceived that there was great favourlaid up for those that died godly, it was an holy and good thought.Whereupon he made a reconciliation for the dead, that they might bedelivered from sin.   

{13:1} In the hundred forty and ninth year it was told Judas, thatAntiochus Eupator was coming with a great power into Judea,   

{13:2} And with him Lysias his protector, and ruler of his affairs,having either of them a Grecian power of footmen, an hundred and tenthousand, and horsemen five thousand and three hundred, and elephantstwo and twenty, and three hundred chariots armed with hooks.   

{13:3} Menelaus also joined himself with them, and with greatdissimulation encouraged Antiochus, not for the safeguard of thecountry, but because he thought to have been made governor.   

{13:4} But the King of kings moved Antiochus' mind against thiswicked wretch, and Lysias informed the king that this man was the causeof all mischief, so that the king commanded to bring him unto Berea,and to put him to death, as the manner is in that place.   

{13:5} Now there was in that place a tower of fifty cubits high,full of ashes, and it had a round instrument which on every side hangeddown into the ashes.   

{13:6} And whosoever was condemned of sacrilege, or had committedany other grievous crime, there did all men thrust him unto death.   

{13:7} Such a death it happened that wicked man to die, not havingso much as burial in the earth; and that most justly:   

{13:8} For inasmuch as he had committed many sins about the altar,whose fire and ashes were holy, he received his death in ashes.   

{13:9} Now the king came with a barbarous and haughty mind to do farworse to the Jews, than had been done in his father's time.   

{13:10} Which things when Judas perceived, he commanded themultitude to call upon the Lord night and day, that if ever at anyother time, he would now also help them, being at the point to be putfrom their law, from their country, and from the holy temple:   

{13:11} And that he would not suffer the people, that had even nowbeen but a little refreshed, to be in subjection to the blasphemousnations.   

{13:12} So when they had all done this together, and besought themerciful Lord with weeping and fasting, and lying flat upon the groundthree days long, Judas, having exhorted them, commanded they should bein a readiness.   

{13:13} And Judas, being apart with the elders, determined, beforethe king's host should enter into Judea, and get the city, to go forthand try the matter in fight by the help of the Lord.   

{13:14} So when he had committed all to the Creator of the world,and exhorted his soldiers to fight manfully, even unto death, for thelaws, the temple, the city, the country, and the commonwealth, hecamped by Modin:   

{13:15} And having given the watchword to them that were about him,Victory is of God; with the most valiant and choice young men he wentin into the king's tent by night, and slew in the camp about fourthousand men, and the chiefest of the elephants, with all that wereupon him.   

{13:16} And at last they filled the camp with fear and tumult, anddeparted with good success.   

{13:17} This was done in the break of the day, because theprotection of the Lord did help him.   

{13:18} Now when the king had taken a taste of the manliness of theJews, he went about to take the holds by policy,   

{13:19} And marched toward Bethsura, which was a strong hold of theJews: but he was put to flight, failed, and lost of his men:   

{13:20} For Judas had conveyed unto them that were in it such thingsas were necessary.   

{13:21} But Rhodocus, who was in the Jews' host, disclosed thesecrets to the enemies; therefore he was sought out, and when they hadgotten him, they put him in prison.   

{13:22} The king treated with them in Bethsum the second time, gavehis hand, took their's, departed, fought with Judas, was overcome;   

{13:23} Heard that Philip, who was left over the affairs in Antioch,was desperately bent, confounded, intreated the Jews, submittedhimself, and sware to all equal conditions, agreed with them, andoffered sacrifice, honoured the temple, and dealt kindly with the place,   

{13:24} And accepted well of Maccabeus, made him principal governorfrom Ptolemais unto the Gerrhenians;   

{13:25} Came to Ptolemais: the people there were grieved for thecovenants; for they stormed, because they would make their covenantsvoid:   

{13:26} Lysias went up to the judgment seat, said as much as couldbe in defence of the cause, persuaded, pacified, made them wellaffected, returned to Antioch. Thus it went touching the king's comingand departing.   

{14:1} After three years was Judas informed, that Demetrius the sonof Seleucus, having entered by the haven of Tripolis with a great powerand navy,   

{14:2} Had taken the country, and killed Antiochus, and Lysias hisprotector.   

{14:3} Now one Alcimus, who had been high priest, and had defiledhimself wilfully in the times of their mingling with the Gentiles,seeing that by no means he could save himself, nor have any more accessto the holy altar,   

{14:4} Came to king Demetrius in the hundred and one and fiftiethyear, presenting unto him a crown of gold, and a palm, and also of theboughs which were used solemnly in the temple: and so that day he heldhis peace.   

{14:5} Howbeit having gotten opportunity to further his foolishenterprize, and being called into counsel by Demetrius, and asked howthe Jews stood affected, and what they intended, he answered thereunto:   

{14:6} Those of the Jews that he called Assideans, whose captain isJudas Maccabeus, nourish war and are seditious, and will not let therest be in peace.   

{14:7} Therefore I, being deprived of mine ancestors' honour, I meanthe high priesthood, am now come hither:   

{14:8} First, verily for the unfeigned care I have of thingspertaining to the king; and secondly, even for that I intend the goodof mine own countrymen: for all our nation is in no small miserythrough the unadvised dealing of them aforersaid.   

{14:9} Wherefore, O king, seeing knowest all these things, becareful for the country, and our nation, which is pressed on everyside, according to the clemency that thou readily shewest unto all.   

{14:10} For as long as Judas liveth, it is not possible that thestate should be quiet.   

{14:11} This was no sooner spoken of him, but others of the king'sfriends, being maliciously set against Judas, did more incenseDemetrius.   

{14:12} And forthwith calling Nicanor, who had been master of theelephants, and making him governor over Judea, he sent him forth,   

{14:13} Commanding him to slay Judas, and to scatter them that werewith him, and to make Alcimus high priest of the great temple.   

{14:14} Then the heathen, that had fled out of Judea from Judas,came to Nicanor by flocks, thinking the harm and calamities ot the Jewsto be their welfare.   

{14:15} Now when the Jews heard of Nicanor's coming, and that theheathen were up against them, they cast earth upon their heads, andmade supplication to him that had established his people for ever, andwho always helpeth his portion with manifestation of his presence.   

{14:16} So at the commandment of the captain they removedstraightways from thence, and came near unto them at the town of Dessau.   

{14:17} Now Simon, Judas' brother, had joined battle with Nicanor,but was somewhat discomfited through the sudden silence of his enemies.   

{14:18} Nevertheless Nicanor, hearing of the manliness of them thatwere with Judas, and the courageousness that they had to fight fortheir country, durst not try the matter by the sword.   

{14:19} Wherefore he sent Posidonius, and Theodotus, and Mattathias,to make peace.   

{14:20} So when they had taken long advisement thereupon, and thecaptain had made the multitude acquainted therewith, and it appearedthat they were all of one mind, they consented to the covenants,   

{14:21} And appointed a day to meet in together by themselves: andwhen the day came, and stools were set for either of them,   

{14:22} Ludas placed armed men ready in convenient places, lest sometreachery should be suddenly practised by the enemies: so they made apeaceable conference.   

{14:23} Now Nicanor abode in Jerusalem, and did no hurt, but sentaway the people that came flocking unto him.   

{14:24} And he would not willingly have Judas out of his sight: forhe love the man from his heart   

{14:25} He prayed him also to take a wife, and to beget children: sohe married, was quiet, and took part of this life.   

{14:26} But Alcimus, perceiving the love that was betwixt them, andconsidering the covenants that were made, came to Demetrius, and toldhim that Nicanor was not well affected toward the state; for that hehad ordained Judas, a traitor to his realm, to be the king's successor.   

{14:27} Then the king being in a rage, and provoked with theaccusations of the most wicked man, wrote to Nicanor, signifying thathe was much displeased with the covenants, and commanding him that heshould send Maccabeus prisoner in all haste unto Antioch.   

{14:28} When this came to Nicanor's hearing, he was much confoundedin himself, and took it grievously that he should make void thearticles which were agreed upon, the man being in no fault.   

{14:29} But because there was no dealing against the king, hewatched his time to accomplish this thing by policy.   

{14:30} Notwithstanding, when Maccabeus saw that Nicanor began to bechurlish unto him, and that he entreated him more roughly than he waswont, perceiving that such sour behaviour came not of good, he gatheredtogether not a few of his men, and withdrew himself from Nicanor.   

{14:31} But the other, knowing that he was notably prevented byJudas' policy, came into the great and holy temple, and commanded thepriests, that were offering their usual sacrifices, to deliver him theman.   

{14:32} And when they sware that they could not tell where the manwas whom he sought,   

{14:33} He stretched out his right hand toward the temple, and madean oath in this manner: If ye will not deliver me Judas as a prisoner,I will lay this temple of God even with the ground, and I will breakdown the altar, and erect a notable temple unto Bacchus.   

{14:34} After these words he departed. Then the priests lifted uptheir hands toward heaven, and besought him that was ever a defender oftheir nation, saying in this manner;   

{14:35} Thou, O Lord of all things, who hast need of nothing, wastpleased that the temple of thine habitation should be among us:   

{14:36} Therefore now, O holy Lord of all holiness, keep this houseever undefiled, which lately was cleansed, and stop every unrighteousmouth.   

{14:37} Now was there accused unto Nicanor one Razis, one of theelders of Jerusalem, a lover of his countrymen, and a man of very goodreport, who for his kindness was called a father of the Jews.   

{14:38} For in the former times, when they mingled not themselveswith the Gentiles, he had been accused of Judaism, and did boldlyjeopard his body and life with all vehemency for the religion of theJews.   

{14:39} So Nicanor, willing to declare the hate that he bare untothe Jews, sent above five hundred men of war to take him:   

{14:40} For he thought by taking him to do the Jews much hurt.   

{14:41} Now when the multitude would have taken the tower, andviolently broken into the outer door, and bade that fire should bebrought to burn it, he being ready to be taken on every side fell uponhis sword;   

{14:42} Choosing rather to die manfully, than to come into the handsof the wicked, to be abused otherwise than beseemed his noble birth:   

{14:43} But missing his stroke through haste, the multitude alsorushing within the doors, he ran boldly up to the wall, and casthimself down manfully among the thickest of them.   

{14:44} But they quickly giving back, and a space being made, hefell down into the midst of the void place.   

{14:45} Nevertheless, while there was yet breath within him, beinginflamed with anger, he rose up; and though his blood gushed out likespouts of water, and his wounds were grievous, yet he ran through themidst of the throng; and standing upon a steep rock,   

{14:46} When as his blood was now quite gone, he plucked out hisbowels, and taking them in both his hands, he cast them upon thethrong, and calling upon the Lord of life and spirit to restore himthose again, he thus died.   

{15:1} But Nicanor, hearing that Judas and his company were in thestrong places about Samaria, resolved without any danger to set uponthem on the sabbath day.   

{15:2} Nevertheless the Jews that were compelled to go with himsaid, O destroy not so cruelly and barbarously, but give honour to thatday, which he, that seeth all things, hath honoured with holiness aboveall other days.   

{15:3} Then the most ungracious wretch demanded, if there were aMighty one in heaven, that had commanded the sabbath day to be kept.   

{15:4} And when they said, There is in heaven a living Lord, andmighty, who commanded the seventh day to be kept:   

{15:5} Then said the other, And I also am mighty upon earth, and Icommand to take arms, and to do the king's business. Yet he obtainednot to have his wicked will done.   

{15:6} So Nicanor in exceeding pride and haughtiness determined toset up a publick monument of his victory over Judas and them that werewith him.   

{15:7} But Maccabeus had ever sure confidence that the Lord wouldhelp him:   

{15:8} Wherefore he exhorted his people not to fear the coming ofthe heathen against them, but to remember the help which in formertimes they had received from heaven, and now to expect the victory andaid, which should come unto them from the Almighty.   

{15:9} And so comforting them out of the law and the prophets, andwithal putting them in mind of the battles that they won afore, he madethem more cheerful.   

{15:10} And when he had stirred up their minds, he gave them theircharge, shewing them therewithall the falsehood of the heathen, and thebreach of oaths.   

{15:11} Thus he armed every one of them, not so much with defence ofshields and spears, as with comfortable and good words: and besidethat, he told them a dream worthy to be believed, as if it had been soindeed, which did not a little rejoice them.   

{15:12} And this was his vision: That Onias, who had been highpriest, a virtuous and a good man, reverend in conversation, gentle incondition, well spoken also, and exercised from a child in all pointsof virtue, holding up his hands prayed for the whole body of the Jews.   

{15:13} This done, in like manner there appeared a man with grayhairs, and exceeding glorious, who was of a wonderful and excellentmajesty.   

{15:14} Then Onias answered, saying, This is a lover of thebrethren, who prayeth much for the people, and for the holy city, towit, Jeremias the prophet of God.   

{15:15} Whereupon Jeremias holding forth his right hand gave toJudas a sword of gold, and in giving it spake thus,   

{15:16} Take this holy sword, a gift from God, with the which thoushalt wound the adversaries.   

{15:17} Thus being well comforted by the words of Judas, which werevery good, and able to stir them up to valour, and to encourage thehearts of the young men, they determined not to pitch camp, butcourageously to set upon them, and manfully to try the matter byconflict, because the city and the sanctuary and the temple were indanger.   

{15:18} For the care that they took for their wives, and theirchildren, their brethren, and folks, was in least account with them:but the greatest and principal fear was for the holy temple.   

{15:19} Also they that were in the city took not the least care,being troubled for the conflict abroad.   

{15:20} And now, when as all looked what should be the trial, andthe enemies were already come near, and the army was set in array, andthe beasts conveniently placed, and the horsemen set in wings,   

{15:21} Maccabeus seeing the coming of the multitude, and the diverspreparations of armour, and the fierceness of the beasts, stretched outhis hands toward heaven, and called upon the Lord that worketh wonders,knowing that victory cometh not by arms, but even as it seemeth good tohim, he giveth it to such as are worthy:   

{15:22} Therefore in his prayer he said after this manner; O Lord,thou didst send thine angel in the time of Ezekias king of Judea, anddidst slay in the host of Sennacherib an hundred fourscore and fivethousand:   

{15:23} Wherefore now also, O Lord of heaven, send a good angelbefore us for a fear and dread unto them;   

{15:24} And through the might of thine arm let those be strickenwith terror, that come against thy holy people to blaspheme. And heended thus.   

{15:25} Then Nicanor and they that were with him came forward withtrumpets and songs.   

{15:26} But Judas and his company encountered the enemies withinvocation and prayer.   

{15:27} So that fighting with their hands, and praying unto God withtheir hearts, they slew no less than thirty and five thousand men: forthrough the appearance of God they were greatly cheered.   

{15:28} Now when the battle was done, returning again with joy, theyknew that Nicanor lay dead in his harness.   

{15:29} Then they made a great shout and a noise, praising theAlmighty in their own language.   

{15:30} And Judas, who was ever the chief defender of the citizensboth in body and mind, and who continued his love toward his countrymenall his life, commanded to strike off Nicanor's head, and his hand withhis shoulder, and bring them to Jerusalem.   

{15:31} So when he was there, and called them of his nationtogether, and set the priests before the altar, he sent for them thatwere of the tower,   

{15:32} And shewed them vile Nicanor's head, and the hand of thatblasphemer, which with proud brags he had stretched out against theholy temple of the Almighty.   

{15:33} And when he had cut out the tongue of that ungodly Nicanor,he commanded that they should give it by pieces unto the fowls, andhang up the reward of his madness before the temple.   

{15:34} So every man praised toward the heaven the glorious Lord,saying, Blessed be he that hath kept his own place undefiled.   

{15:35} He hanged also Nicanor's head upon the tower, an evident andmanifest sign unto all of the help of the Lord.   

{15:36} And they ordained all with a common decree in no case to letthat day pass without solemnity, but to celebrate the thirtieth day ofthe twelfth month, which in the Syrian tongue is called Adar, the daybefore Mardocheus' day.   

{15:37} Thus went it with Nicanor: and from that time forth theHebrews had the city in their power. And here will I make an end.   

{15:38} And if I have done well, and as is fitting the story, it isthat which I desired: but if slenderly and meanly, it is that which Icould attain unto.   

{15:39} For as it is hurtful to drink wine or water alone; and aswine mingled with water is pleasant, and delighteth the taste: even sospeech finely framed delighteth the ears of them that read the story.And here shall be an end.The First Book of Esdras   

{1:1} And Josias held the feast of the passover in Jerusalem untohis Lord, and offered the passover the fourteenth day of the firstmonth;   

{1:2} Having set the priests according to their daily courses, beingarrayed in long garments, in the temple of the Lord.   

{1:3} And he spake unto the Levites, the holy ministers of Israel,that they should hallow themselves unto the Lord, to set the holy arkof the Lord in the house that king Solomon the son of David had built:   

{1:4} And said, Ye shall no more bear the ark upon your shoulders:now therefore serve the Lord your God, and minister unto his peopleIsrael, and prepare you after your families and kindreds,   

{1:5} According as David the king of Israel prescribed, andaccording to the magnificence of Solomon his son: and standing in thetemple according to the several dignity of the families of you theLevites, who minister in the presence of your brethren the children ofIsrael,   

{1:6} Offer the passover in order, and make ready the sacrifices foryour brethren, and keep the passover according to the commandment ofthe Lord, which was given unto Moses.   

{1:7} And unto the people that was found there Josias gave thirtythousand lambs and kids, and three thousand calves: these things weregiven of the king's allowance, according as he promised, to the people,to the priests, and to the Levites.   

{1:8} And Helkias, Zacharias, and Syelus, the governors of thetemple, gave to the priests for the passover two thousand and sixhundred sheep, and three hundred calves.   

{1:9} And Jeconias, and Samaias, and Nathanael his brother, andAssabias, and Ochiel, and Joram, captains over thousands, gave to theLevites for the passover five thousand sheep, and seven hundred calves.   

{1:10} And when these things were done, the priests and Levites,having the unleavened bread, stood in very comely order according tothe kindreds,   

{1:11} And according to the several dignities of the fathers, beforethe people, to offer to the Lord, as it is written in the book ofMoses: and thus did they in the morning.   

{1:12} And they roasted the passover with fire, as appertaineth: asfor the sacrifices, they sod them in brass pots and pans with a goodsavour,   

{1:13} And set them before all the people: and afterward theyprepared for themselves, and for the priests their brethren, the sonsof Aaron.   

{1:14} For the priests offered the fat until night: and the Levitesprepared for themselves, and the priests their brethren, the sons ofAaron.   

{1:15} The holy singers also, the sons of Asaph, were in theirorder, according to the appointment of David, to wit, Asaph, Zacharias,and Jeduthun, who was of the king's retinue.   

{1:16} Moreover the porters were at every gate; it was not lawfulfor any to go from his ordinary service: for their brethren the Levitesprepared for them.   

{1:17} Thus were the things that belonged to the sacrifices of theLord accomplished in that day, that they might hold  the passover,   

{1:18} And offer sacrifices upon the altar of the Lord, according tothe commandment of king Josias.   

{1:19} So the children of Israel which were present held thepassover at that time, and the feast of sweet bread seven days.   

{1:20} And such a passover was not kept in Israel since the time ofthe prophet Samuel.   

{1:21} Yea, all the kings of Israel held not such a passover asJosias, and the priests, and the Levites, and the Jews, held with allIsrael that were found dwelling at Jerusalem.   

{1:22} In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josias was thispassover kept.   

{1:23} And the works or Josias were upright before his Lord with anheart full of godliness.   

{1:24} As for the things that came to pass in his time, they werewritten in former times, concerning those that sinned, and did wickedlyagainst the Lord above all people and kingdoms, and how they grievedhim exceedingly, so that the words of the Lord rose up against Israel.   

{1:25} Now after all these acts of Josias it came to pass, thatPharaoh the king of Egypt came to raise war at Carchamis uponEuphrates: and Josias went out against him.   

{1:26} But the king of Egypt sent to him, saying, What have I to dowith thee, O king of Judea?   

{1:27} I am not sent out from the Lord God against thee; for my waris upon Euphrates: and now the Lord is with me, yea, the Lord is withme hasting me forward: depart from me, and be not against the Lord.   

{1:28} Howbeit Josias did not turn back his chariot from him, butundertook to fight with him, not regarding the words of the prophetJeremy spoken by the mouth of the Lord:   

{1:29} But joined battle with him in the plain of Magiddo, and theprinces came against king Josias.   

{1:30} Then said the king unto his servants, Carry me away out ofthe battle; for I am very weak. And immediately his servants took himaway out of the battle.   

{1:31} Then gat he up upon his second chariot; and being broughtback to Jerusalem died, and was buried in his father's sepulchre.   

{1:32} And in all Jewry they mourned for Josias, yea, Jeremy theprophet lamented for Josias, and the chief men with the women madelamentation for him unto this day: and this was given out for anordinance to be done continually in all the nation of Israel.   

{1:33} These things are written in the book of the stories of thekings of Judah, and every one of the acts that Josias did, and hisglory, and his understanding in the law of the Lord, and the thingsthat he had done before, and the things now recited, are reported inthe book of the kings of Israel and Judea.   

{1:34} And the people took Joachaz the son of Josias, and made himking instead of Josias his father, when he was twenty and three yearsold.   

{1:35} And he reigned in Judea and in Jerusalem three months: andthen the king of Egypt deposed him from reigning in Jerusalem.   

{1:36} And he set a tax upon the land of an hundred talents ofsilver and one talent of gold.   

{1:37} The king of Egypt also made king Joacim his brother king ofJudea and Jerusalem.   

{1:38} And he bound Joacim and the nobles: but Zaraces his brotherhe apprehended, and brought him out of Egypt.   

{1:39} Five and twenty years old was Joacim when he was made king inthe land of Judea and Jerusalem; and he did evil before the Lord.   

{1:40} Wherefore against him Nabuchodonosor the king of Babylon cameup, and bound him with a chain of brass, and carried him into Babylon.   

{1:41} Nabuchodonosor also took of the holy vessels of the Lord, andcarried them away, and set them in his own temple at Babylon.   

{1:42} But those things that are recorded of him, and of hisuncleaness and impiety, are written in the chronicles of the kings.   

{1:43} And Joacim his son reigned in his stead: he was made kingbeing eighteen years old;   

{1:44} And reigned but three months and ten days in Jerusalem; anddid evil before the Lord.   

{1:45} So after a year Nabuchodonosor sent and caused him to bebrought into Babylon with the holy vessels of the Lord;   

{1:46} And made Zedechias king of Judea and Jerusalem, when he wasone and twenty years old; and he reigned eleven years:   

{1:47} And he did evil also in the sight of the Lord, and cared notfor the words that were spoken unto him by the prophet Jeremy from themouth of the Lord.   

{1:48} And after that king Nabuchodonosor had made him to swear bythe name of the Lord, he forswore himself, and rebelled; and hardeninghis neck, his heart, he transgressed the laws of the Lord God of Israel.   

{1:49} The governors also of the people and of the priests did manythings against the laws, and passed all the pollutions of all nations,and defiled the temple of the Lord, which was sanctified in Jerusalem.   

{1:50} Nevertheless the God of their fathers sent by his messengerto call them back, because he spared them and his tabernacle also.   

{1:51} But they had his messengers in derision; and, look, when theLord spake unto them, they made a sport of his prophets:   

{1:52} So far forth, that he, being wroth with his people for theirgreat ungodliness, commanded the kings of the Chaldees to come upagainst them;   

{1:53} Who slew their young men with the sword, yea, even within thecompass of their holy temple, and spared neither young man nor maid,old man nor child, among them; for he delivered all into their hands.   

{1:54} And they took all the holy vessels of the Lord, both greatand small, with the vessels of the ark of God, and the king'streasures, and carried them away into Babylon.   

{1:55} As for the house of the Lord, they burnt it, and brake downthe walls of Jerusalem, and set fire upon her towers:   

{1:56} And as for her glorious things, they never ceased till theyhad consumed and brought them all to nought: and the people that werenot slain with the sword he carried unto Babylon:   

{1:57} Who became servants to him and his children, till thePersians reigned, to fulfil the word of the Lord spoken by the mouth ofJeremy:   

{1:58} Until the land had enjoyed her sabbaths, the whole time ofher desolation shall she rest, until the full term of seventy years.   

{2:1} In the first year of Cyrus king of the Persians, that the wordof the Lord might be accomplished, that he had promised by the mouth ofJeremy;   

{2:2} The Lord raised up the spirit of Cyrus the king of thePersians, and he made proclamation through all his kingdom, and also bywriting,   

{2:3} Saying, Thus saith Cyrus king of the Persians; The Lord ofIsrael, the most high Lord, hath made me king of the whole world,   

{2:4} And commanded me to build him an house at Jerusalem in Jewry.   

{2:5} If therefore there be any of you that are of his people, letthe Lord, even his Lord, be with him, and let him go up to Jerusalemthat is in Judea, and build the house of the Lord of Israel: for he isthe Lord that dwelleth in Jerusalem.   

{2:6} Whosoever then dwell in the places about, let them help him,those, I say, that are his neighbours, with gold, and with silver,   

{2:7} With gifts, with horses, and with cattle, and other things,which have been set forth by vow, for the temple of the Lord atJerusalem.   

{2:8} Then the chief of the families of Judea and of the tribe ofBenjamin stood up; the priests also, and the Levites, and all theywhose mind the Lord had moved to go up, and to build an house for theLord at Jerusalem,   

{2:9} And they that dwelt round about them, and helped them in allthings with silver and gold, with horses and cattle, and with very manyfree gifts of a great number whose minds were stirred up thereto.   

{2:10} King Cyrus also brought forth the holy vessels, whichNabuchodonosor had carried away from Jerusalem, and had set up in histemple of idols.   

{2:11} Now when Cyrus king of the Persians had brought them forth,he delivered them to Mithridates his treasurer:   

{2:12} And by him they were delivered to Sanabassar the governor ofJudea.   

{2:13} And this was the number of them; A thousand golden cups, anda thousand of silver, censers of silver twenty nine, vials of goldthirty, and of silver two thousand four hundred and ten, and a thousandother vessels.   

{2:14} So all the vessels of gold and of silver, which were carriedaway, were five thousand four hundred threescore and nine.   

{2:15} These were brought back by Sanabassar, together with them ofthe captivity, from Babylon to Jerusalem.   

{2:16} But in the time of Artexerxes king of the Persians Belemus,and Mithridates, and Tabellius, and Rathumus, and Beeltethmus, andSemellius the secretary, with others that were in commission with them,dwelling in Samaria and other places, wrote unto him against them thatdwelt in Judea and Jerusalem these letters following;   

{2:17} To king Artexerxes our lord, Thy servants, Rathumus thestorywriter, and Semellius the scribe, and the rest of their council,and the judges that are in Celosyria and Phenice.   

{2:18} Be it now known to the lord king, that the Jews that are upfrom you to us, being come into Jerusalem, that rebellious and wickedcity, do build the marketplaces, and repair the walls of it and do laythe foundation of the temple.   

{2:19} Now if this city and the walls thereof be made up again, theywill not only refuse to give tribute, but also rebel against kings.   

{2:20} And forasmuch as the things pertaining to the temple are nowin hand, we think it meet not to neglect such a matter,   

{2:21} But to speak unto our lord the king, to the intent that, ifit be thy pleasure it may be sought out in the books of thy fathers:   

{2:22} And thou shalt find in the chronicles what is writtenconcerning these things, and shalt understand that that city wasrebellious, troubling both kings and cities:   

{2:23} And that the Jews were rebellious, and raised always warstherein; for the which cause even this city was made desolate.   

{2:24} Wherefore now we do declare unto thee, O lord the king, thatif this city be built again, and the walls thereof set up anew, thoushalt from henceforth have no passage into Celosyria and Phenice.   

{2:25} Then the king wrote back again to Rathumus the storywriter,to Beeltethmus, to Semellius the scribe, and to the rest that were incommission, and dwellers in Samaria and Syria and Phenice, after thismanner;   

{2:26} I have read the epistle which ye have sent unto me: thereforeI commanded to make diligent search, and it hath been found that thatcity was from the beginning practising against kings;   

{2:27} And the men therein were given to rebellion and war: and thatmighty kings and fierce were in Jerusalem, who reigned and exactedtributes in Celosyria and Phenice.   

{2:28} Now therefore I have commanded to hinder those men frombuilding the city, and heed to be taken that there be no more done init;   

{2:29} And that those wicked workers proceed no further to theannoyance of kings,   

{2:30} Then king Artexerxes his letters being read, Rathumus, andSemellius the scribe, and the rest that were in commission with them,removing in haste toward Jerusalem with a troop of horsemen and amultitude of people in battle array, began to hinder the builders; andthe building of the temple in Jerusalem ceased until the second year ofthe reign of Darius king of the Persians.   

{3:1} Now when Darius reigned, he made a great feast unto all hissubjects, and unto all his household, and unto all the princes of Mediaand Persia,   

{3:2} And to all the governors and captains and lieutenants thatwere under him, from India unto Ethiopia, of an hundred twenty andseven provinces.   

{3:3} And when they had eaten and drunken, and being satisfied weregone home, then Darius the king went into his bedchamber, and slept,and soon after awaked.   

{3:4} Then three young men, that were of the guard that kept theking's body, spake one to another;   

{3:5} Let every one of us speak a sentence: he that shall overcome,and whose sentence shall seem wiser than the others, unto him shall theking Darius give great gifts, and great things in token of victory:   

{3:6} As, to be clothed in purple, to drink in gold, and to sleepupon gold, and a chariot with bridles of gold, and an headtire of finelinen, and a chain about his neck:   

{3:7} And he shall sit next to Darius because of his wisdom, andshall be called Darius his cousin.   

{3:8} And then every one wrote his sentence, sealed it, and laid itunder king Darius his pillow;   

{3:9} And said that, when the king is risen, some will give him thewritings; and of whose side the king and the three princes of Persiashall judge that his sentence is the wisest, to him shall the victorybe given, as was appointed.   

{3:10} The first wrote, Wine is the strongest.   

{3:11} The second wrote, The king is strongest.   

{3:12} The third wrote, Women are strongest: but above all thingsTruth beareth away the victory.   

{3:13} Now when the king was risen up, they took their writings, anddelivered them unto him, and so he read them:   

{3:14} And sending forth he called all the princes of Persia andMedia, and the governors, and the captains, and the lieutenants, andthe chief officers;   

{3:15} And sat him down in the royal seat of judgment; and thewritings were read before them.   

{3:16} And he said, Call the young men, and they shall declare theirown sentences. So they were called, and came in.   

{3:17} And he said unto them, Declare unto us your mind concerningthe writings. Then began the first, who had spoken of the strength ofwine;   

{3:18} And he said thus, O ye men, how exceeding strong is wine! itcauseth all men to err that drink it:   

{3:19} It maketh the mind of the king and of the fatherless child tobe all one; of the bondman and of the freeman, of the poor man and ofthe rich:   

{3:20} It turneth also every thought into jollity and mirth, so thata man remembereth neither sorrow nor debt:   

{3:21} And it maketh every heart rich, so that a man rememberethneither king nor governor; and it maketh to speak all things by talents:   

{3:22} And when they are in their cups, they forget their love bothto friends and brethren, and a little after draw out swords:   

{3:23} But when they are from the wine, they remember not what theyhave done.   

{3:24} O ye men, is not wine the strongest, that enforceth to dothus? And when he had so spoken, he held his peace.   

{4:1} Then the second, that had spoken of the strength of the king,began to say,   

{4:2} O ye men, do not men excel in strength that bear rule over seaand land and all things in them?   

{4:3} But yet the king is more mighty: for he is lord of all thesethings, and hath dominion over them; and whatsoever he commandeth themthey do.   

{4:4} If he bid them make war the one against the other, they do it:if he send them out against the enemies, they go, and break downmountains walls and towers.   

{4:5} They slay and are slain, and transgress not the king'scommandment: if they get the victory, they bring all to the king, aswell the spoil, as all things else.   

{4:6} Likewise for those that are no soldiers, and have not to dowith wars, but use husbundry, when they have reaped again that whichthey had sown, they bring it to the king, and compel one another to paytribute unto the king.   

{4:7} And yet he is but one man: if he command to kill, they kill;if he command to spare, they spare;   

{4:8} If he command to smite, they smite; if he command to makedesolate, they make desolate; if he command to build, they build;   

{4:9} If he command to cut down, they cut down; if he command toplant, they plant.   

{4:10} So all his people and his armies obey him: furthermore helieth down, he eateth and drinketh, and taketh his rest:   

{4:11} And these keep watch round about him, neither may any onedepart, and do his own business, neither disobey they him in any thing.   

{4:12} O ye men, how should not the king be mightiest, when in suchsort he is obeyed? And he held his tongue.   

{4:13} Then the third, who had spoken of women, and of the truth,(this was Zorobabel) began to speak.   

{4:14} O ye men, it is not the great king, nor the multitude of men,neither is it wine, that excelleth; who is it then that ruleth them, orhath the lordship over them? are they not women?   

{4:15} Women have borne the king and all the people that bear ruleby sea and land.   

{4:16} Even of them came they: and they nourished them up thatplanted the vineyards, from whence the wine cometh.   

{4:17} These also make garments for men; these bring glory unto men;and without women cannot men be.   

{4:18} Yea, and if men have gathered together gold and silver, orany other goodly thing, do they not love a woman which is comely infavour and beauty?   

{4:19} And letting all those things go, do they not gape, and evenwith open mouth fix their eyes fast on her; and have not all men moredesire unto her than unto silver or gold, or any goodly thingwhatsoever?   

{4:20} A man leaveth his own father that brought him up, and his owncountry, and cleaveth unto his wife.   

{4:21} He sticketh not to spend his life with his wife. andremembereth neither father, nor mother, nor country.   

{4:22} By this also ye must know that women have dominion over you:do ye not labour and toil, and give and bring all to the woman?   

{4:23} Yea, a man taketh his sword, and goeth his way to rob and tosteal, to sail upon the sea and upon rivers;   

{4:24} And looketh upon a lion, and goeth in the darkness; and whenhe hath stolen, spoiled, and robbed, he bringeth it to his love.   

{4:25} Wherefore a man loveth his wife better than father or mother.   

{4:26} Yea, many there be that have run out of their wits for women,and become servants for their sakes.   

{4:27} Many also have perished, have erred, and sinned, for women.   

{4:28} And now do ye not believe me? is not the king great in hispower? do not all regions fear to touch him?   

{4:29} Yet did I see him and Apame the king's concubine, thedaughter of the admirable Bartacus, sitting at the right hand of theking,   

{4:30} And taking the crown from the king's head, and setting itupon her own head; she also struck the king with her left hand.   

{4:31} And yet for all this the king gaped and gazed upon her withopen mouth: if she laughed upon him, he laughed also: but if she tookany displeasure at him, the king was fain to flatter, that she might bereconciled to him again.   

{4:32} O ye men, how can it be but women should be strong, seeingthey do thus?   

{4:33} Then the king and the princes looked one upon another: so hebegan to speak of the truth.   

{4:34} O ye men, are not women strong? great is the earth, high isthe heaven, swift is the sun in his course, for he compasseth theheavens round about, and fetcheth his course again to his own place inone day.   

{4:35} Is he not great that maketh these things? therefore great isthe truth, and stronger than all things.   

{4:36} All the earth crieth upon the truth, and the heaven blessethit: all works shake and tremble at it, and with it is no unrighteousthing.   

{4:37} Wine is wicked, the king is wicked, women are wicked, all thechildren of men are wicked, and such are all their wicked works; andthere is no truth in them; in their unrighteousness also they shallperish.   

{4:38} As for the truth, it endureth, and is alwaYs strong; itliveth and conquereth for evermore.   

{4:39} With her there is no accepting of persons or rewards; but shedoeth the things that are just, and refraineth from all unjust andwicked things; and all men do well like of her works.   

{4:40} Neither in her judgment is any unrighteousness; and she isthe strength, kingdom, power, and majesty, of all ages. Blessed be theGod of truth.   

{4:41} And with that he held his peace. And all the people thenshouted, and said, Great is Truth, and mighty above all things.   

{4:42} Then said the king unto him, Ask what thou wilt more than isappointed in the writing, and we will give it thee, because thou artfound wisest; and thou shalt sit next me, and shalt be called my cousin.   

{4:43} Then said he unto the king, Remember thy vow, which thou hastvowed to build Jerusalem, in the day when thou camest to thy kingdom,   

{4:44} And to send away all the vessels that were taken away out ofJerusalem, which Cyrus set apart, when he vowed to destroy Babylon, andto send them again thither.   

{4:45} Thou also hast vowed to build up the temple, which theEdomites burned when Judea was made desolate by the Chaldees.   

{4:46} And now, O lord the king, this is that which I require, andwhich I desire of thee, and this is the princely liberality proceedingfrom thyself: I desire therefore that thou make good the vow, theperformance whereof with thine own mouth thou hast vowed to the King ofheaven.   

{4:47} Then Darius the king stood up, and kissed him, and wroteletters for him unto all the treasurers and lieutenants and captainsand governors, that they should safely convey on their way both him,and all those that go up with him to build Jerusalem.   

{4:48} He wrote letters also unto the lieutenants that were inCelosyria and Phenice, and unto them in Libanus, that they should bringcedar wood from Libanus unto Jerusalem, and that they should build thecity with him.   

{4:49} Moreover he wrote for all the Jews that went out of his realmup into Jewry, concerning their freedom, that no officer, no ruler, nolieutenant, nor treasurer, should forcibly enter into their doors;   

{4:50} And that all the country which they hold should be freewithout tribute; and that the Edomites should give over the villages ofthe Jews which then they held:   

{4:51} Yea, that there should be yearly given twenty talents to thebuilding of the temple, until the time that it were built;   

{4:52} And other ten talents yearly, to maintain the burnt offeringsupon the altar every day, as they had a commandment to offer seventeen:   

{4:53} And that all they that went from Babylon to build the cityshould have free liberty, as well they as their posterity, and all thepriests that went away.   

{4:54} He wrote also concerning. the charges, and the priests'vestments wherein they minister;   

{4:55} And likewise for the charges of the Levites, to be given themuntil the day that the house were finished, and Jerusalem builded up.   

{4:56} And he commanded to give to all that kept the city pensionsand wages.   

{4:57} He sent away also all the vessels from Babylon, that Cyrushad set apart; and all that Cyrus had given in commandment, the samecharged he also to be done, and sent unto Jerusalem.   

{4:58} Now when this young man was gone forth, he lifted up his faceto heaven toward Jerusalem, and praised the King of heaven,   

{4:59} And said, From thee cometh victory, from thee cometh wisdom,and thine is the glory, and I am thy servant.   

{4:60} Blessed art thou, who hast given me wisdom: for to thee Igive thanks, O Lord of our fathers.   

{4:61} And so he took the letters, and went out, and came untoBabylon, and told it all his brethren.   

{4:62} And they praised the God of their fathers, because he hadgiven them freedom and liberty   

{4:63} To go up, and to build Jerusalem, and the temple which iscalled by his name: and they feasted with instruments of musick andgladness seven days.   

{5:1} After this were the principal men of the families chosenaccording to their tribes, to go up with their wives and sons anddaughters, with their menservants and maidservants, and their cattle.   

{5:2} And Darius sent with them a thousand horsemen, till they hadbrought them back to Jerusalem safely, and with musical [instruments]tabrets and flutes.   

{5:3} And all their brethren played, and he made them go up togetherwith them.   

{5:4} And these are the names of the men which went up, according totheir families among their tribes, after their several heads.   

{5:5} The priests, the sons of Phinees the son of Aaron: Jesus theson of Josedec, the son of Saraias, and Joacim the son of Zorobabel,the son of Salathiel, of the house of David, out of the kindred ofPhares, of the tribe of Judah;   

{5:6} Who spake wise sentences before Darius the king of Persia inthe second year of his reign, in the month Nisan, which is the firstmonth.   

{5:7} And these are they of Jewry that came up from the captivity,where they dwelt as strangers, whom Nabuchodonosor the king of Babylonhad carried away unto Babylon.   

{5:8} And they returned unto Jerusalem, and to the other parts ofJewry, every man to his own city, who came with Zorobabel, with Jesus,Nehemias, and Zacharias, and Reesaias, Enenius, Mardocheus. Beelsarus,Aspharasus, Reelius, Roimus, and Baana, their guides.

{5:35} All the ministers of the temple, and the sons of the servantsof Solomon, were three hundred seventy and two.   

{5:36} These came up from Thermeleth and Thelersas, Charaathalarleading them, and Aalar;   

{5:37} Neither could they shew their families, nor their stock, howthey were of Israel: the sons of Ladan, the son of Ban, the sons ofNecodan, six hundred fifty and two.   

{5:38} And of the priests that usurped the office of the priesthood,and were not found: the sons of Obdia, the sons of Accoz, the sons ofAddus, who married Augia one of the daughters of Barzelus, and wasnamed after his name.   

{5:39} And when the description of the kindred of these men wassought in the register, and was not found, they were removed fromexecuting the office of the priesthood:   

{5:40} For unto them said Nehemias and Atharias, that they shouldnot be partakers of the holy things, till there arose up an high priestclothed with doctrine and truth.   

{5:41} So of Israel, from them of twelve years old and upward, theywere all in number forty thousand, beside menservants and womenservantstwo thousand three hundred and sixty.   

{5:42} Their menservants and handmaids were seven thousand threehundred forty and seven: the singing men and singing women, two hundredforty and five:   

{5:43} Four hundred thirty and five camels, seven thousand thirtyand six horses, two hundred forty and five mules, five thousand fivehundred twenty and five beasts used to the yoke.   

{5:44} And certain of the chief of their families, when they came tothe temple of God that is in Jerusalem, vowed to set up the house againin his own place according to their ability,   

{5:45} And to give into the holy treasury of the works a thousandpounds of gold, five thousand of silver, and an hundred priestlyvestments.   

{5:46} And so dwelt the priests and the Levites and the people inJerusalem, and in the country, the singers also and the porters; andall Israel in their villages.   

{5:47} But when the seventh month was at hand, and when the childrenof Israel were every man in his own place, they came all together withone consent into the open place of the first gate which is toward theeast.   

{5:48} Then stood up Jesus the son of Josedec, and his brethren thepriests and Zorobabel the son of Salathiel, and his brethren, and madeready the altar of the God of Israel,   

{5:49} To offer burnt sacrifices upon it, according as it isexpressly commanded in the book of Moses the man of God.   

{5:50} And there were gathered unto them out of the other nations ofthe land, and they erected the altar upon his own place, because allthe nations of the land were at enmity with them, and oppressed them;and they offered sacrifices according to the time, and burnt offeringsto the Lord both morning and evening.   

{5:51} Also they held the feast of tabernacles, as it is commandedin the law, and offered sacrifices daily, as was meet:   

{5:52} And after that, the continual oblations, and the sacrifice ofthe sabbaths, and of the new moons, and of all holy feasts.   

{5:53} And all they that had made any vow to God began to offersacrifices to God from the first day of the seventh month, although thetemple of the Lord was not yet built.   

{5:54} And they gave unto the masons and carpenters money, meat, anddrink, with cheerfulness.   

{5:55} Unto them of Zidon also and Tyre they gave carrs, that theyshould bring cedar trees from Libanus, which should be brought byfloats to the haven of Joppa, according as it was commanded them byCyrus king of the Persians.   

{5:56} And in the second year and second month after his coming tothe temple of God at Jerusalem began Zorobabel the son of Salathiel,and Jesus the son of Josedec, and their brethren, and the priests, andthe Levites, and all they that were come unto Jerusalem out of thecaptivity:   

{5:57} And they laid the foundation of the house of God in the firstday of the second month, in the second year after they were come toJewry and Jerusalem.   

{5:58} And they appointed the Levites from twenty years old over theworks of the Lord. Then stood up Jesus, and his sons and brethren, andCadmiel his brother, and the sons of Madiabun, with the sons of Jodathe son of Eliadun, with their sons and brethren, all Levites, with oneaccord setters forward of the business, labouring to advance the worksin the house of God. So the workmen built the temple of the Lord.   

{5:59} And the priests stood arrayed in their vestments with musicalinstruments and trumpets; and the Levites the sons of Asaph had cymbals,   

{5:60} Singing songs of thanksgiving, and praising the Lord,according as David the king of Israel had ordained.   

{5:61} And they sung with loud voices songs to the praise of theLord, because his mercy and glory is for ever in all Israel.   

{5:62} And all the people sounded trumpets, and shouted with a loudvoice, singing songs of thanksgiving unto the Lord for the rearing upof the house of the Lord.   

{5:63} Also of the priests and Levites, and of the chief of theirfamilies, the ancients who had seen the former house came to thebuilding of this with weeping and great crying.   

{5:64} But many with trumpets and joy shouted with loud voice,   

{5:65} Insomuch that the trumpets might not be heard for the weepingof the people: yet the multitude sounded marvellously, so that it washeard afar off.   

{5:66} Wherefore when the enemies of the tribe of Judah and Benjaminheard it, they came to know what that noise of trumpets should mean.   

{5:67} And they perceived that they that were of the captivity didbuild the temple unto the Lord God of Israel.   

{5:68} So they went to Zorobabel and Jesus, and to the chief of thefamilies, and said unto them, We will build together with you.   

{5:69} For we likewise, as ye, do obey your Lord, and do sacrificeunto him from the days of Azbazareth the king of the Assyrians, whobrought us hither.   

{5:70} Then Zorobabel and Jesus and the chief of the families ofIsrael said unto them, It is not for us and you to build together anhouse unto the Lord our God.   

{5:71} We ourselves alone will build unto the Lord of Israel,according as Cyrus the king of the Persians hath commanded us.   

{5:72} But the heathen of the land lying heavy upon the inhabitantsof Judea, and holding them strait, hindered their building;   

{5:73} And by their secret plots, and popular persuasions andcommotions, they hindered the finishing of the building all the timethat king Cyrus lived: so they were hindered from building for thespace of two years, until the reign of Darius.   

{6:1} Now in the second year of the reign of Darius Aggeus andZacharias the son of Addo, the prophets, prophesied unto the Jews inJewry and Jerusalem in the name of the Lord God of Israel, which wasupon them.   

{6:2} Then stood up Zorobabel the son of Salatiel, and Jesus the sonof Josedec, and began to build the house of the Lord at Jerusalem, theprophets of the Lord being with them, and helping them.   

{6:3} At the same time came unto them Sisinnes the governor of Syriaand Phenice, with Sathrabuzanes and his companions, and said unto them,   

{6:4} By whose appointment do ye build this house and this roof, andperform all the other things? and who are the workmen that performthese things?   

{6:5} Nevertheless the elders of the Jews obtained favour, becausethe Lord had visited the captivity;   

{6:6} And they were not hindered from building, until such time assignification was given unto Darius concerning them, and an answerreceived.   

{6:7} The copy of the letters which Sisinnes, governor of Syria andPhenice, and Sathrabuzanes, with their companions, rulers in Syria andPhenice, wrote and sent unto Darius; To king Darius, greeting:   

{6:8} Let all things be known unto our lord the king, that beingcome into the country of Judea, and entered into the city of Jerusalemwe found in the city of Jerusalem the ancients of the Jews that were ofthe captivity   

{6:9} Building an house unto the Lord, great and new, of hewn andcostly stones, and the timber already laid upon the walls.   

{6:10} And those works are done with great speed, and the work goethon prosperously in their hands, and with all glory and diligence is itmade.   

{6:11} Then asked we these elders, saying, By whose commandmentbuild ye this house, and lay the foundations of these works?   

{6:12} Therefore to the intent that we might give knowledge untothee by writing, we demanded of them who were the chief doers, and werequired of them the names in writing of their principal men.   

{6:13} So they gave us this answer, We are the servants of the Lordwhich made heaven and earth.   

{6:14} And as for this house, it was builded many years ago by aking of Israel great and strong, and was finished.   

{6:15} But when our fathers provoked God unto wrath, and sinnedagainst the Lord of Israel which is in heaven, he gave them over intothe power of Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon, of the Chaldees;   

{6:16} Who pulled down the house, and burned it, and carried awaythe people captives unto Babylon.   

{6:17} But in the first year that king Cyrus reigned over thecountry of Babylon Cyrus the king wrote to build up this house.   

{6:18} And the holy vessels of gold and of silver, thatNabuchodonosor had carried away out of the house at Jerusalem, and hadset them in his own temple those Cyrus the king brought forth again outof the temple at Babylon, and they were delivered to Zorobabel and toSanabassarus the ruler,   

{6:19} With commandment that he should carry away the same vessels,and put them in the temple at Jerusalem; and that the temple of theLord should be built in his place.   

{6:20} Then the same Sanabassarus, being come hither, laid thefoundations of the house of the Lord at Jerusalem; and from that timeto this being still a building, it is not yet fully ended.   

{6:21} Now therefore, if it seem good unto the king, let search bemade among the records of king Cyrus:   

{6:22} And if it be found that the building of the house of the Lordat Jerusalem hath been done with the consent of king Cyrus, and if ourlord the king be so minded, let him signify unto us thereof.   

{6:23} Then commanded king Darius to seek among the records atBabylon: and so at Ecbatane the palace, which is in the country ofMedia, there was found a roll wherein these things were recorded.   

{6:24} In the first year of the reign of Cyrus king Cyrus commandedthat the house of the Lord at Jerusalem should be built again, wherethey do sacrifice with continual fire:   

{6:25} Whose height shall be sixty cubits and the breadth sixtycubits, with three rows of hewn stones, and one row of new wood of thatcountry; and the expences thereof to be given out of the house of kingCyrus:   

{6:26} And that the holy vessels of the house of the Lord, both ofgold and silver, that Nabuchodonosor took out of the house atJerusalem, and brought to Babylon, should be restored to the house atJerusalem, and be set in the place where they were before.   

{6:27} And also he commanded that Sisinnes the governor of Syria andPhenice, and Sathrabuzanes, and their companions, and those which wereappointed rulers in Syria and Phenice, should be careful not to meddlewith the place, but suffer Zorobabel, the servant of the Lord, andgovernor of Judea, and the elders of the Jews, to build the house ofthe Lord in that place.   

{6:28} I have commanded also to have it built up whole again; andthat they look diligently to help those that be of the captivity of theJews, till the house of the Lord be finished:   

{6:29} And out of the tribute of Celosyria and Phenice a portioncarefully to be given these men for the sacrifices of the Lord, thatis, to Zorobabel the governor, for bullocks, and rams, and lambs;   

{6:30} And also corn, salt, wine, and oil, and that continuallyevery year without further question, according as the priests that bein Jerusalem shall signify to be daily spent:   

{6:31} That offerings may be made to the most high God for the kingand for his children, and that they may pray for their lives.   

{6:32} And he commanded that whosoever should transgress, yea, ormake light of any thing afore spoken or written, out of his own houseshould a tree be taken, and he thereon be hanged, and all his goodsseized for the king.   

{6:33} The Lord therefore, whose name is there called upon, utterlydestroy every king and nation, that stretcheth out his hand to hinderor endamage that house of the Lord in Jerusalem.   

{6:34} I Darius the king have ordained that according unto thesethings it be done with diligence.   

{7:1} Then Sisinnes the governor of Celosyria and Phenice, andSathrabuzanes, with their companions following the commandments of kingDarius,   

{7:2} Did very carefully oversee the holy works, assisting theancients of the Jews and governors of the temple.   

{7:3} And so the holy works prospered, when Aggeus and Zacharias theprophets prophesied.   

{7:4} And they finished these things by the commandment of the LordGod of Israel, and with the consent of Cyrus, Darius, and Artexerxes,kings of Persia.   

{7:5} And thus was the holy house finished in the three andtwentieth day of the month Adar, in the sixth year of Darius king ofthe Persians   

{7:6} And the children of Israel, the priests, and the Levites, andothers that were of the captivity, that were added unto them, didaccording to the things written in the book of Moses.   

{7:7} And to the dedication of the temple of the Lord they offeredan hundred bullocks two hundred rams, four hundred lambs;   

{7:8} And twelve goats for the sin of all Israel, according to thenumber of the chief of the tribes of Israel.   

{7:9} The priests also and the Levites stood arrayed in theirvestments, according to their kindreds, in the service of the Lord Godof Israel, according to the book of Moses: and the porters at everygate.   

{7:10} And the children of Israel that were of the captivity heldthe passover the fourteenth day of the first month, after that thepriests and the Levites were sanctified.   

{7:11} They that were of the captivity were not all sanctifiedtogether: but the Levites were all sanctified together.   

{7:12} And so they offered the passover for all them of thecaptivity, and for their brethren the priests, and for themselves.   

{7:13} And the children of Israel that came out of the captivity dideat, even all they that had separated themselves from the abominationsof the people of the land, and sought the Lord.   

{7:14} And they kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days,making merry before the Lord,   

{7:15} For that he had turned the counsel of the king of Assyriatoward them, to strengthen their hands in the works of the Lord God ofIsrael.   

{8:1} And after these things, when Artexerxes the king of thePersians reigned came Esdras the son of Saraias, the son of Ezerias,the son of Helchiah, the son of Salum,   

{8:2} The son of Sadduc, the son of Achitob, the son of Amarias, theson of Ezias, the son of Meremoth, the son of Zaraias, the son ofSavias, the son of Boccas, the son of Abisum, the son of Phinees, theson of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the chief priest.   

{8:3} This Esdras went up from Babylon, as a scribe, being veryready in the law of Moses, that was given by the God of Israel.   

{8:4} And the king did him honour: for he found grace in his sightin all his requests.   

{8:5} There went up with him also certain of the children of Israel,of the priest of the Levites, of the holy singers, porters, andministers of the temple, unto Jerusalem,   

{8:6} In the seventh year of the reign of Artexerxes, in the fifthmonth, this was the king's seventh year; for they went from Babylon inthe first day of the first month, and came to Jerusalem, according tothe prosperous journey which the Lord gave them.   

{8:7} For Esdras had very great skill, so that he omitted nothing ofthe law and commandments of the Lord, but taught all Israel theordinances and judgments.   

{8:8} Now the copy of the commission, which was written fromArtexerxes the king, and came to Esdras the priest and reader of thelaw of the Lord, is this that followeth;   

{8:9} King Artexerxes unto Esdras the priest and reader of the lawof the Lord sendeth greeting:   

{8:10} Having determined to deal graciously, I have given order,that such of the nation of the Jews, and of the priests and Levitesbeing within our realm, as are willing and desirous should go with theeunto Jerusalem.   

{8:11} As many therefore as have a mind thereunto, let them departwith thee, as it hath seemed good both to me and my seven friends thecounsellors;   

{8:12} That they may look unto the affairs of Judea and Jerusalem,agreeably to that which is in the law of the Lord;   

{8:13} And carry the gifts unto the Lord of Israel to Jerusalem,which I and my friends have vowed, and all the gold and silver that inthe country of Babylon can be found, to the Lord in Jerusalem,   

{8:14} With that also which is given of the people for the temple ofthe Lord their God at Jerusalem: and that silver and gold may becollected for bullocks, rams, and lambs, and things thereuntoappertaining;   

{8:15} To the end that they may offer sacrifices unto the Lord uponthe altar of the Lord their God, which is in Jerusalem.   

{8:16} And whatsoever thou and thy brethren will do with the silverand gold, that do, according to the will of thy God.   

{8:17} And the holy vessels of the Lord, which are given thee forthe use of the temple of thy God, which is in Jerusalem, thou shalt setbefore thy God in Jerusalem.   

{8:18} And whatsoever thing else thou shalt remember for the use ofthe temple of thy God, thou shalt give it out of the king's treasury.   

{8:19} And I king Artexerxes have also commanded the keepers of thetreasures in Syria and Phenice, that whatsoever Esdras the priest andthe reader of the law of the most high God shall send for, they shouldgive it him with speed,   

{8:20} To the sum of an hundred talents of silver, likewise also ofwheat even to an hundred cors, and an hundred pieces of wine, and otherthings in abundance.   

{8:21} Let all things be performed after the law of God diligentlyunto the most high God, that wrath come not upon the kingdom of theking and his sons.   

{8:22} I command you also, that ye require no tax, nor any otherimposition, of any of the priests, or Levites, or holy singers, orporters, or ministers of the temple, or of any that have doings in thistemple, and that no man have authority to impose any thing upon them.   

{8:23} And thou, Esdras, according to the wisdom of God ordainjudges and justices, that they may judge in all Syria and Phenice allthose that know the law of thy God; and those that know it not thoushalt teach.   

{8:24} And whosoever shall transgress the law of thy God, and of theking, shall be punished diligently, whether it be by death, or otherpunishment, by penalty of money, or by imprisonment.   

{8:25} Then said Esdras the scribe, Blessed be the only Lord God ofmy fathers, who hath put these things into the heart of the king, toglorify his house that is in Jerusalem:   

{8:26} And hath honoured me in the sight of the king, and hiscounsellors, and all his friends and nobles.   

{8:27} Therefore was I encouraged by the help of the Lord my God,and gathered together men of Israel to go up with me.   

{8:28} And these are the chief according to their families andseveral dignities, that went up with me from Babylon in the reign ofking Artexerxes:   

{8:29} Of the sons of Phinees, Gerson: of the sons of Ithamar,Gamael: of the sons of David, Lettus the son of Sechenias:   

{8:30} Of the sons of Pharez, Zacharias; and with him were countedan hundred and fifty men:   

{8:31} Of the sons of Pahath Moab, Eliaonias, the son of Zaraias,and with him two hundred men:   

{8:32} Of the sons of Zathoe, Sechenias the son of Jezelus, and withhim three hundred men: of the sons of Adin, Obeth the son of Jonathan,and with him two hundred and fifty men:   

{8:33} Of the sons of Elam, Josias son of Gotholias, and with himseventy men:   

{8:34} Of the sons of Saphatias, Zaraias son of Michael, and withhim threescore and ten men:   

{8:35} Of the sons of Joab, Abadias son of Jezelus, and with him twohundred and twelve men:   

{8:36} Of the sons of Banid, Assalimoth son of Josaphias, and withhim an hundred and threescore men:   

{8:37} Of the sons of Babi, Zacharias son of Bebai, and with himtwenty and eight men:   

{8:38} Of the sons of Astath, Johannes son of Acatan, and with himan hundred and ten men:   

{8:39} Of the sons of Adonikam the last, and these are the names ofthem, Eliphalet, Jewel, and Samaias, and with them seventy men:   

{8:40} Of the sons of Bago, Uthi the son of Istalcurus, and with himseventy men.   

{8:41} And these I gathered together to the river called Theras,where we pitched our tents three days: and then I surveyed them.   

{8:42} But when I had found there none of the priests and Levites,   

{8:43} Then sent I unto Eleazar, and Iduel, and Masman,   

{8:44} And Alnathan, and Mamaias, and Joribas, and Nathan, Eunatan,Zacharias, and Mosollamon, principal men and learned.   

{8:45} And I bade them that they should go unto Saddeus the captain,who was in the place of the treasury:   

{8:46} And commanded them that they should speak unto Daddeus, andto his brethren, and to the treasurers in that place, to send us suchmen as might execute the priests' office in the house of the Lord.   

{8:47} And by the mighty hand of our Lord they brought unto usskilful men of the sons of Moli the son of Levi, the son of Israel,Asebebia, and his sons, and his brethren, who were eighteen.   

{8:48} And Asebia, and Annus, and Osaias his brother, of the sons ofChannuneus, and their sons, were twenty men.   

{8:49} And of the servants of the temple whom David had ordained,and the principal men for the service of the Levites to wit, theservants of the temple two hundred and twenty, the catalogue of whosenames were shewed.   

{8:50} And there I vowed a fast unto the young men before our Lord,to desire of him a prosperous journey both for us and them that werewith us, for our children, and for the cattle:   

{8:51} For I was ashamed to ask the king footmen, and horsemen, andconduct for safeguard against our adversaries.   

{8:52} For we had said unto the king, that the power of the Lord ourGod should be with them that seek him, to support them in all ways.   

{8:53} And again we besought our Lord as touching these things, andfound him favourable unto us.   

{8:54} Then I separated twelve of the chief of the priests,Esebrias, and Assanias, and ten men of their brethren with them:   

{8:55} And I weighed them the gold, and the silver, and the holyvessels of the house of our Lord, which the king, and his council, andthe princes, and all Israel, had given.   

{8:56} And when I had weighed it, I delivered unto them six hundredand fifty talents of silver, and silver vessels of an hundred talents,and an hundred talents of gold,   

{8:57} And twenty golden vessels, and twelve vessels of brass, evenof fine brass, glittering like gold.   

{8:58} And I said unto them, Both ye are holy unto the Lord, and thevessels are holy, and the gold and the silver is a vow unto the Lord,the Lord of our fathers.   

{8:59} Watch ye, and keep them till ye deliver them to the chief ofthe priests and Levites, and to the principal men of the families ofIsrael, in Jerusalem, into the chambers of the house of our God.   

{8:60} So the priests and the Levites, who had received the silverand the gold and the vessels, brought them unto Jerusalem, into thetemple of the Lord.   

{8:61} And from the river Theras we departed the twelfth day of thefirst month, and came to Jerusalem by the mighty hand of our Lord,which was with us: and from the beginning of our journey the Lorddelivered us from every enemy, and so we came to Jerusalem.   

{8:62} And when we had been there three days, the gold and silverthat was weighed was delivered in the house of our Lord on the fourthday unto Marmoth the priest the son of Iri.   

{8:63} And with him was Eleazar the son of Phinees, and with themwere Josabad the son of Jesu and Moeth the son of Sabban, Levites: allwas delivered them by number and weight.   

{8:64} And all the weight of them was written up the same hour.   

{8:65} Moreover they that were come out of the captivity offeredsacrifice unto the Lord God of Israel, even twelve bullocks for allIsrael, fourscore and sixteen rams,   

{8:66} Threescore and twelve lambs, goats for a peace offering,twelve; all of them a sacrifice to the Lord.   

{8:67} And they delivered the king's commandments unto the king'sstewards' and to the governors of Celosyria and Phenice; and theyhonoured the people and the temple of God.   

{8:68} Now when these things were done, the rulers came unto me, andsaid,   

{8:69} The nation of Israel, the princes, the priests and Levites,have not put away from them the strange people of the land, nor thepollutions of the Gentiles to wit, of the Canaanites, Hittites,Pheresites, Jebusites, and the Moabites, Egyptians, and Edomites.   

{8:70} For both they and their sons have married with theirdaughters, and the holy seed is mixed with the strange people of theland; and from the beginning of this matter the rulers and the greatmen have been partakers of this iniquity.   

{8:71} And as soon as I had heard these things, I rent my clothes,and the holy garment, and pulled off the hair from off my head andbeard, and sat me down sad and very heavy.   

{8:72} So all they that were then moved at the word of the Lord Godof Israel assembled unto me, whilst I mourned for the iniquity: but Isat still full of heaviness until the evening sacrifice.   

{8:73} Then rising up from the fast with my clothes and the holygarment rent, and bowing my knees, and stretching forth my hands untothe Lord,   

{8:74} I said, O Lord, I am confounded and ashamed before thy face;   

{8:75} For our sins are multiplied above our heads, and ourignorances have reached up unto heaven.   

{8:76} For ever since the time of our fathers we have been and arein great sin, even unto this day.   

{8:77} And for our sins and our fathers' we with our brethren andour kings and our priests were given up unto the kings of the earth, tothe sword, and to captivity, and for a prey with shame, unto this day.   

{8:78} And now in some measure hath mercy been shewed unto us fromthee, O Lord, that there should be left us a root and a name in theplace of thy sanctuary;   

{8:79} And to discover unto us a light in the house of the Lord ourGod, and to give us food in the time of our servitude.   

{8:80} Yea, when we were in bondage, we were not forsaken of ourLord; but he made us gracious before the kings of Persia, so that theygave us food;   

{8:81} Yea, and honoured the temple of our Lord, and raised up thedesolate Sion, that they have given us a sure abiding in Jewry andJerusalem.   

{8:82} And now, O Lord, what shall we say, having these things? forwe have transgressed thy commandments, which thou gavest by the hand ofthy servants the prophets, saying,   

{8:83} That the land, which ye enter into to possess as an heritage,is a land polluted with the pollutions of the strangers of the land,and they have filled it with their uncleanness.   

{8:84} Therefore now shall ye not join your daughters unto theirsons, neither shall ye take their daughters unto your sons.   

{8:85} Moreover ye shall never seek to have peace with them, that yemay be strong, and eat the good things of the land, and that ye mayleave the inheritance of the land unto your children for evermore.   

{8:86} And all that is befallen is done unto us for our wicked worksand great sins; for thou, O Lord, didst make our sins light,   

{8:87} And didst give unto us such a root: but we have turned backagain to transgress thy law, and to mingle ourselves with theuncleanness of the nations of the land.   

{8:88} Mightest not thou be angry with us to destroy us, till thouhadst left us neither root, seed, nor name?   

{8:89} O Lord of Israel, thou art true: for we are left a root thisday.   

{8:90} Behold, now are we before thee in our iniquities, for wecannot stand any longer by reason of these things before thee.   

{8:91} And as Esdras in his prayer made his confession, weeping, andlying flat upon the ground before the temple, there gathered unto himfrom Jerusalem a very great multitude of men and women and children:for there was great weeping among the multitude.   

{8:92} Then Jechonias the son of Jeelus, one of the sons of Israel,called out, and said, O Esdras, we have sinned against the Lord God, wehave married strange women of the nations of the land, and now is allIsrael aloft.   

{8:93} Let us make an oath to the Lord, that we will put away allour wives, which we have taken of the heathen, with their children,   

{8:94} Like as thou hast decreed, and as many as do obey the law ofthe Lord.   

{8:95} Arise and put in execution: for to thee doth this matterappertain, and we will be with thee: do valiantly.   

{8:96} So Esdras arose, and took an oath of the chief of the priestsand Levites of all Israel to do after these things; and so they sware.   

{9:1} Then Esdras rising from the court of the temple went to thechamber of Joanan the son of Eliasib,   

{9:2} And remained there, and did eat no meat nor drink water,mourning for the great iniquities of the multitude.   

{9:3} And there was a proclamation in all Jewry and Jerusalem to allthem that were of the captivity, that they should be gathered togetherat Jerusalem:   

{9:4} And that whosoever met not there within two or three daysaccording as the elders that bare rule appointed, their cattle shouldbe seized to the use of the temple, and himself cast out from them thatwere of the captivity.   

{9:5} And in three days were all they of the tribe of Judah andBenjamin gathered together at Jerusalem the twentieth day of the ninthmonth.   

{9:6} And all the multitude sat trembling in the broad court of thetemple because of the present foul weather.   

{9:7} So Esdras arose up, and said unto them, Ye have transgressedthe law in marrying strange wives, thereby to increase the sins ofIsrael.   

{9:8} And now by confessing give glory unto the Lord God of ourfathers,   

{9:9} And do his will, and separate yourselves from the heathen ofthe land, and from the strange women.   

{9:10} Then cried the whole multitude, and said with a loud voice,Like as thou hast spoken, so will we do.   

{9:11} But forasmuch as the people are many, and it is foul weather,so that we cannot stand without, and this is not a work of a day ortwo, seeing our sin in these things is spread far:   

{9:12} Therefore let the rulers of the multitude stay, and let allthem of our habitations that have strange wives come at the timeappointed,   

{9:13} And with them the rulers and judges of every place, till weturn away the wrath of the Lord from us for this matter.   

{9:14} Then Jonathan the son of Azael and Ezechias the son ofTheocanus accordingly took this matter upon them: and Mosollam andLevis and Sabbatheus helped them.   

{9:15} And they that were of the captivity did according to allthese things.   

{9:16} And Esdras the priest chose unto him the principal men oftheir families, all by name: and in the first day of the tenth monththey sat together to examine the matter.   

{9:17} So their cause that held strange wives was brought to an endin the first day of the first month.   

{9:18} And of the priests that were come together, and had strangewives, there were found:   

{9:19} Of the sons of Jesus the son of Josedec, and his brethren;Matthelas and Eleazar, and Joribus and Joadanus.   

{9:20} And they gave their hands to put away their wives and tooffer rams to make reconcilement for their errors.   

{9:21} And of the sons of Emmer; Ananias, and Zabdeus, and Eanes,and Sameius, and Hiereel, and Azarias.   

{9:22} And of the sons of Phaisur; Elionas, Massias Israel, andNathanael, and Ocidelus and Talsas.   

{9:23} And of the Levites; Jozabad, and Semis, and Colius, who wascalled Calitas, and Patheus, and Judas, and Jonas.   

{9:24} Of the holy singers; Eleazurus, Bacchurus.   

{9:25} Of the porters; Sallumus, and Tolbanes.   

{9:26} Of them of Israel, of the sons of Phoros; Hiermas, andEddias, and Melchias, and Maelus, and Eleazar, and Asibias, and Baanias.   

{9:27} Of the sons of Ela; Matthanias, Zacharias, and Hierielus, andHieremoth, and Aedias.   

{9:28} And of the sons of Zamoth; Eliadas, Elisimus, Othonias,Jarimoth, and Sabatus, and Sardeus.   

{9:29} Of the sons of Babai; Johannes, and Ananias and Josabad, andAmatheis.   

{9:30} Of the sons of Mani; Olamus, Mamuchus, Jedeus, Jasubus,Jasael, and Hieremoth.   

{9:31} And of the sons of Addi; Naathus, and Moosias, Lacunus, andNaidus, and Mathanias, and Sesthel, Balnuus, and Manasseas.   

{9:32} And of the sons of Annas; Elionas and Aseas, and Melchias,and Sabbeus, and Simon Chosameus.   

{9:33} And of the sons of Asom; Altaneus, and Matthias, and Baanaia,Eliphalet, and Manasses, and Semei.   

{9:34} And of the sons of Maani; Jeremias, Momdis, Omaerus, Juel,Mabdai, and Pelias, and Anos, Carabasion, and Enasibus, andMamnitanaimus, Eliasis, Bannus, Eliali, Samis, Selemias, Nathanias: andof the sons of Ozora; Sesis, Esril, Azaelus, Samatus, Zambis, Josephus.   

{9:35} And of the sons of Ethma; Mazitias, Zabadaias, Edes, Juel,Banaias.   

{9:36} All these had taken strange wives, and they put them awaywith their children.   

{9:37} And the priests and Levites, and they that were of Israel,dwelt in Jerusalem, and in the country, in the first day of the seventhmonth: so the children of Israel were in their habitations.   

{9:38} And the whole multitude came together with one accord intothe broad place of the holy porch toward the east:   

{9:39} And they spake unto Esdras the priest and reader, that hewould bring the law of Moses, that was given of the Lord God of Israel.   

{9:40} So Esdras the chief priest brought the law unto the wholemultitude from man to woman, and to all the priests, to hear law in thefirst day of the seventh month.   

{9:41} And he read in the broad court before the holy porch frommorning unto midday, before both men and women; and the multitude gaveheed unto the law.   

{9:42} And Esdras the priest and reader of the law stood up upon apulpit of wood, which was made for that purpose.   

{9:43} And there stood up by him Mattathias, Sammus, Ananias,Azarias, Urias, Ezecias, Balasamus, upon the right hand:   

{9:44} And upon his left hand stood Phaldaius, Misael, Melchias,Lothasubus, and Nabarias.   

{9:45} Then took Esdras the book of the law before the multitude:for he sat honourably in the first place in the sight of them all.   

{9:46} And when he opened the law, they stood all straight up. SoEsdras blessed the Lord God most High, the God of hosts, Almighty.   

{9:47} And all the people answered, Amen; and lifting up their handsthey fell to the ground, and worshipped the Lord.   

{9:48} Also Jesus, Anus, Sarabias, Adinus, Jacubus, Sabateas,Auteas, Maianeas, and Calitas, Asrias, and Joazabdus, and Ananias,Biatas, the Levites, taught the law of the Lord, making them withal tounderstand it.   

{9:49} Then spake Attharates unto Esdras the chief priest. andreader, and to the Levites that taught the multitude, even to all,saying,   

{9:50} This day is holy unto the Lord; (for they all wept when theyheard the law:)   

{9:51} Go then, and eat the fat, and drink the sweet, and send partto them that have nothing;   

{9:52} For this day is holy unto the Lord: and be not sorrowful; forthe Lord will bring you to honour.   

{9:53} So the Levites published all things to the people, saying,This day is holy to the Lord; be not sorrowful.   

{9:54} Then went they their way, every one to eat and drink, andmake merry, and to give part to them that had nothing, and to makegreat cheer;   

{9:55} Because they understood the words wherein they wereinstructed, and for the which they had been assembled.The Second Book of Esdras   

{1:1} The second book of the prophet Esdras, the son of Saraias, theson of Azarias, the son of Helchias, the son of Sadamias, the sou ofSadoc, the son of Achitob,   

{1:2} The son of Achias, the son of Phinees, the son of Heli, theson of Amarias, the son of Aziei, the son of Marimoth, the son of Andhe spake unto the of Borith, the son of Abisei, the son of Phinees, theson of Eleazar,   

{1:3} The son of Aaron, of the tribe of Levi; which was captive inthe land of the Medes, in the reign of Artexerxes king of the Persians.   

{1:4} And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying,   

{1:5} Go thy way, and shew my people their sinful deeds, and theirchildren their wickedness which they have done against me; that theymay tell their children's children:   

{1:6} Because the sins of their fathers are increased in them: forthey have forgotten me, and have offered unto strange gods.   

{1:7} Am not I even he that brought them out of the land of Egypt,from the house of bondage? but they have provoked me unto wrath, anddespised my counsels.   

{1:8} Pull thou off then the hair of thy head, and cast all evilupon them, for they have not been obedient unto my law, but it is arebellious people.   

{1:9} How long shall I forbear them, into whom I have done so muchgood?   

{1:10} Many kings have I destroyed for their sakes; Pharaoh with hisservants and all his power have I smitten down.   

{1:11} All the nations have I destroyed before them, and in the eastI have scattered the people of two provinces, even of Tyrus and Sidon,and have slain all their enemies.   

{1:12} Speak thou therefore unto them, saying, Thus saith the Lord,   

{1:13} I led you through the sea and in the beginning gave you  alarge and safe passage; I gave you Moses for a leader,  and Aaron for apriest.   

{1:14} I gave you light in a pillar of fire, and great wonders haveI done among you; yet have ye forgotten me, saith the Lord.   

{1:15} Thus saith the Almighty Lord, The quails were as a token toyou;  I gave you tents for your safeguard: nevertheless ye murmuredthere,   

{1:16} And triumphed not in my name for the destruction of yourenemies,  but ever to this day do ye yet murmur.   

{1:17} Where are the benefits that I have done for you? when ye werehungry and thirsty in the wilderness, did ye not cry unto me,   

{1:18} Saying, Why hast thou brought us into this wilderness to killus?  it had been better for us to have served the Egyptians,  than todie in this wilderness.   

{1:19} Then had I pity upon your mournings, and gave you manna toeat;  so ye did eat angels' bread.   

{1:20} When ye were thirsty, did I not cleave the rock, and watersflowed out to your fill? for the heat I covered you with the leaves ofthe trees.   

{1:21} I divided among you a fruitful land, I cast out theCanaanites, the Pherezites, and the Philistines, before you: what shallI yet do more for you? saith the Lord.   

{1:22} Thus saith the Almighty Lord, When ye were in the wilderness,in the river of the Amorites, being athirst, and blaspheming my name,   

{1:23} I gave you not fire for your blasphemies, but cast a tree inthe water, and made the river sweet.   

{1:24} What shall I do unto thee, O Jacob? thou, Juda, wouldest notobey me: I will turn me to other nations, and unto those will  I givemy name, that they may keep my statutes.   

{1:25} Seeing ye have forsaken me, I will forsake you also; when yedesire me to be gracious unto you, I shall have no mercy upon you.   

{1:26} Whensoever ye shall call upon me, I will not hear you:  forye have defiled your hands with blood, and your feet are swift  tocommit manslaughter.   

{1:27} Ye have not as it were forsaken me, but your own selves,saith the Lord.   

{1:28} Thus saith the Almighty Lord, Have I not prayed you as afather his sons, as a mother her daughters, and a nurse her young babes,   

{1:29} That ye would be my people, and I should be your God; that yewould be my children, and I should be your father?   

{1:30} I gathered you together, as a hen gathereth her chickensunder her wings: but now, what shall I do unto you? I will cast you outfrom my face.   

{1:31} When ye offer unto me, I will turn my face from you: for yoursolemn feastdays, your new moons, and your circumcisions, have Iforsaken.   

{1:32} I sent unto you my servants the prophets, whom ye have takenand slain, and torn their bodies in pieces, whose blood I will requireof your hands, saith the Lord.   

{1:33} Thus saith the Almighty Lord, Your house is desolate, I willcast you out as the wind doth stubble.   

{1:34} And your children shall not be fruitful; for they havedespised my commandment, and done the thing that is an evil before me.   

{1:35} Your houses will I give to a people that shall come; whichnot having heard of me yet shall believe me; to whom I have shewed nosigns, yet they shall do that I have commanded them.   

{1:36} They have seen no prophets, yet they shall call their sins toremembrance, and acknowledge them.   

{1:37} I take to witness the grace of the people to come, whoselittle ones rejoice in gladness: and though they have not seen me withbodily eyes, yet in spirit they believe the thing that I say.   

{1:38} And now, brother, behold what glory; and see the people thatcome from the east:   

{1:39} Unto whom I will give for leaders, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob,Oseas, Amos, and Micheas, Joel, Abdias, and Jonas,   

{1:40} Nahum, and Abacuc, Sophonias, Aggeus, Zachary, and Malachy,which is called also an angel of the Lord.   

{2:1} Thus saith the Lord, I brought this people out of bondage, andI gave them my commandments by menservants the prophets; whom theywould not hear, but despised my counsels.   

{2:2} The mother that bare them saith unto them, Go your way, yechildren; for I am a widow and forsaken.   

{2:3} I brought you up with gladness; but with sorrow and heavinesshave I lost you: for ye have sinned before the Lord your God, and donethat thing that is evil before him.   

{2:4} But what shall I now do unto you? I am a widow and forsaken:go your way, O my children, and ask mercy of the Lord.   

{2:5} As for me, O father, I call upon thee for a witness over themother of these children, which would not keep my covenant,   

{2:6} That thou bring them to confusion, and their mother to aspoil, that there may be no offspring of them.   

{2:7} Let them be scattered abroad among the heathen, let theirnames be put out of the earth: for they have despised my covenant.   

{2:8} Woe be unto thee, Assur, thou that hidest the unrighteous inthee! O thou wicked people, remember what I did unto Sodom and Gomorrha;   

{2:9} Whose land lieth in clods of pitch and heaps of ashes: even soalso will I do unto them that hear me not, saith the Almighty Lord.   

{2:10} Thus saith the Lord unto Esdras, Tell my people that I willgive them the kingdom of Jerusalem, which I would have given untoIsrael.   

{2:11} Their glory also will I take unto me, and give these theeverlasting tabernacles, which I had prepared for them.   

{2:12} They shall have the tree of life for an ointment of sweetsavour; they shall neither labour, nor be weary.   

{2:13} Go, and ye shall receive: pray for few days unto you, thatthey may be shortened: the kingdom is already prepared for you: watch.   

{2:14} Take heaven and earth to witness; for I have broken the evilin pieces, and created the good: for I live, saith the Lord.   

{2:15} Mother, embrace thy children, and bring them up withgladness, make their feet as fast as a pillar: for I have chosen thee,saith the Lord.   

{2:16} And those that be dead will I raise up again from theirplaces, and bring them out of the graves: for I have known my name inIsrael.   

{2:17} Fear not, thou mother of the children: for I have chosenthee, saith the Lord.   

{2:18} For thy help will I send my servants Esau and Jeremy, afterwhose counsel I have sanctified and prepared for thee twelve treesladen with divers fruits,   

{2:19} And as many fountains flowing with milk and honey, and sevenmighty mountains, whereupon there grow roses and lilies, whereby I willfill thy children with joy.   

{2:20} Do right to the widow, judge for the fatherless, give to thepoor, defend the orphan, clothe the naked,   

{2:21} Heal the broken and the weak, laugh not a lame man to scorn,defend the maimed, and let the blind man come into the sight of myclearness.   

{2:22} Keep the old and young within thy walls.   

{2:23} Wheresoever thou findest the dead, take them and bury them,and I will give thee the first place in my resurrection.   

{2:24} Abide still, O my people, and take thy rest, for thyquietness still come.   

{2:25} Nourish thy children, O thou good nurse; stablish their feet.   

{2:26} As for the servants whom I have given thee, there shall notone of them perish; for I will require them from among thy number.   

{2:27} Be not weary: for when the day of trouble and heavinesscometh, others shall weep and be sorrowful, but thou shalt be merry andhave abundance.   

{2:28} The heathen shall envy thee, but they shall be able to donothing against thee, saith the Lord.   

{2:29} My hands shall cover thee, so that thy children shall not seehell.   

{2:30} Be joyful, O thou mother, with thy children; for I willdeliver thee, saith the Lord.   

{2:31} Remember thy children that sleep, for I shall bring them outof the sides of the earth, and shew mercy unto them: for I am merciful,saith the Lord Almighty.   

{2:32} Embrace thy children until I come and shew mercy unto them:for my wells run over, and my grace shall not fail.   

{2:33} I Esdras received a charge of the Lord upon the mount Oreb,that I should go unto Israel; but when I came unto them, they set me atnought, and despised the commandment of the Lord.   

{2:34} And therefore I say unto you, O ye heathen, that hear andunderstand, look for your Shepherd, he shall give you everlasting rest;for he is nigh at hand, that shall come in the end of the world.   

{2:35} Be ready to the reward of the kingdom, for the everlastinglight shall shine upon you for evermore.   

{2:36} Flee the shadow of this world, receive the joyfulness of yourglory: I testify my Saviour openly.   

{2:37} O receive the gift that is given you, and be glad, givingthanks unto him that hath led you to the heavenly kingdom.   

{2:38} Arise up and stand, behold the number of those that be sealedin the feast of the Lord;   

{2:39} Which are departed from the shadow of the world, and havereceived glorious garments of the Lord.   

{2:40} Take thy number, O Sion, and shut up those of thine that areclothed in white, which have fulfilled the law of the Lord.   

{2:41} The number of thy children, whom thou longedst for, isfulfilled: beseech the power of the Lord, that thy people, which havebeen called from the beginning, may be hallowed.   

{2:42} I Esdras saw upon the mount Sion a great people, whom I couldnot number, and they all praised the Lord with songs.   

{2:43} And in the midst of them there was a young man of a highstature, taller than all the rest, and upon every one of their heads heset crowns, and was more exalted; which I marvelled at greatly.   

{2:44} So I asked the angel, and said, Sir, what are these?   

{2:45} He answered and said unto me, These be they that have put offthe mortal clothing, and put on the immortal, and have confessed thename of God: now are they crowned, and receive palms.   

{2:46} Then said I unto the angel, What young person is it thatcrowneth them, and giveth them palms in their hands?   

{2:47} So he answered and said unto me, It is the Son of God, whomthey have confessed in the world. Then began I greatly to commend themthat stood so stiffly for the name of the Lord.   

{2:48} Then the angel said unto me, Go thy way, and tell my peoplewhat manner of things, and how great wonders of the Lord thy God, thouhast seen.   

{3:1} In the thirtieth year after the ruin of the city I was inBabylon, and lay troubled upon my bed, and my thoughts came up over myheart:   

{3:2} For I saw the desolation of Sion, and the wealth of them thatdwelt at Babylon.   

{3:3} And my spirit was sore moved, so that I began to speak wordsfull of fear to the most High, and said,   

{3:4} O Lord, who bearest rule, thou spakest at the beginning, whenthou didst plant the earth, and that thyself alone, and commandedst thepeople,   

{3:5} And gavest a body unto Adam without soul, which was theworkmanship of thine hands, and didst breathe into him the breath oflife, and he was made living before thee.   

{3:6} And thou leadest him into paradise, which thy right hand hadplanted, before ever the earth came forward.   

{3:7} And unto him thou gavest commandment to love thy way: which hetransgressed, and immediately thou appointedst death in him and in hisgenerations, of whom came nations, tribes, people, and kindreds, out ofnumber.   

{3:8} And every people walked after their own will, and didwonderful things before thee, and despised thy commandments.   

{3:9} And again in process of time thou broughtest the flood uponthose that dwelt in the world, and destroyedst them.   

{3:10} And it came to pass in every of them, that as death was toAdam, so was the flood to these.   

{3:11} Nevertheless one of them thou leftest, namely, Noah with hishousehold, of whom came all righteous men.   

{3:12} And it happened, that when they that dwelt upon the earthbegan to multiply, and had gotten them many children, and were a greatpeople, they began again to be more ungodly than the first.   

{3:13} Now when they lived so wickedly before thee, thou didstchoose thee a man from among them, whose name was Abraham.   

{3:14} Him thou lovedst, and unto him only thou shewedst thy will:   

{3:15} And madest an everlasting covenant with him, promising himthat thou wouldest never forsake his seed.   

{3:16} And unto him thou gavest Isaac, and unto Isaac also thougavest Jacob and Esau. As for Jacob, thou didst choose him to thee, andput by Esau: and so Jacob became a great multitude.   

{3:17} And it came to pass, that when thou leadest his seed out ofEgypt, thou broughtest them up to the mount Sinai.   

{3:18} And bowing the heavens, thou didst set fast the earth,movedst the whole world, and madest the depths to tremble, andtroubledst the men of that age.   

{3:19} And thy glory went through four gates, of fire, and ofearthquake, and of wind, and of cold; that thou mightest give the lawunto the seed of Jacob, and diligence unto the generation of Israel.   

{3:20} And yet tookest thou not away from them a wicked heart, thatthy law might bring forth fruit in them.   

{3:21} For the first Adam bearing a wicked heart transgressed, andwas overcome; and so be all they that are born of him.   

{3:22} Thus infirmity was made permanent; and the law (also) in theheart of the people with the malignity of the root; so that the gooddeparted away, and the evil abode still.   

{3:23} So the times passed away, and the years were brought to anend: then didst thou raise thee up a servant, called David:   

{3:24} Whom thou commandedst to build a city unto thy name, and tooffer incense and oblations unto thee therein.   

{3:25} When this was done many years, then they that inhabited thecity forsook thee,   

{3:26} And in all things did even as Adam and all his generationshad done: for they also had a wicked heart:   

{3:27} And so thou gavest thy city over into the hands of thineenemies.   

{3:28} Are their deeds then any better that inhabit Babylon, thatthey should therefore have the dominion over Sion?   

{3:29} For when I came thither, and had seen impieties withoutnumber, then my soul saw many evildoers in this thirtieth year, so thatmy heart failed me.   

{3:30} For I have seen how thou sufferest them sinning, and hastspared wicked doers: and hast destroyed thy people, and hast preservedthine enemies, and hast not signified it.   

{3:31} I do not remember how this way may be left: Are they then ofBabylon better than they of Sion?   

{3:32} Or is there any other people that knoweth thee beside Israel?or what generation hath so believed thy covenants as Jacob?   

{3:33} And yet their reward appeareth not, and their labour hath nofruit: for I have gone here and there through the heathen, and I seethat they flow in wealth, and think not upon thy commandments.   

{3:34} Weigh thou therefore our wickedness now in the balance, andtheir's also that dwell the world; and so shall thy name no where befound but in Israel.   

{3:35} Or when was it that they which dwell upon the earth have notsinned in thy sight? or what people have so kept thy commandments?   

{3:36} Thou shalt find that Israel by name hath kept thy precepts;but not the heathen.   

{4:1} And the angel that was sent unto me, whose name was Uriel,gave me an answer,   

{4:2} And said, Thy heart hath gone to far in this world, andthinkest thou to comprehend the way of the most High?   

{4:3} Then said I, Yea, my lord. And he answered me, and said, I amsent to shew thee three ways, and to set forth three similitudes beforethee:   

{4:4} Whereof if thou canst declare me one, I will shew thee alsothe way that thou desirest to see, and I shall shew thee from whencethe wicked heart cometh.   

{4:5} And I said, Tell on, my lord. Then said he unto me, Go thyway, weigh me the weight of the fire, or measure me the blast of thewind, or call me again the day that is past.   

{4:6} Then answered I and said, What man is able to do that, thatthou shouldest ask such things of me?   

{4:7} And he said unto me, If I should ask thee how great dwellingsare in the midst of the sea, or how many springs are in the beginningof the deep, or how many springs are above the firmament, or which arethe outgoings of paradise:   

{4:8} Peradventure thou wouldest say unto me, I never went down intothe deep, nor as yet into hell, neither did I ever climb up into heaven.   

{4:9} Nevertheless now have I asked thee but only of the fire andwind, and of the day wherethrough thou hast passed, and of things fromwhich thou canst not be separated, and yet canst thou give me no answerof them.   

{4:10} He said moreover unto me, Thine own things, and such as aregrown up with thee, canst thou not know;   

{4:11} How should thy vessel then be able to comprehend the way ofthe Highest, and, the world being now outwardly corrupted to understandthe corruption that is evident in my sight?   

{4:12} Then said I unto him, It were better that we were not at all,than that we should live still in wickedness, and to suffer, and not toknow wherefore.   

{4:13} He answered me, and said, I went into a forest into a plain,and the trees took counsel,   

{4:14} And said, Come, let us go and make war against the sea thatit may depart away before us, and that we may make us more woods.   

{4:15} The floods of the sea also in like manner took counsel, andsaid, Come, let us go up and subdue the woods of the plain, that therealso we may make us another country.   

{4:16} The thought of the wood was in vain, for the fire came andconsumed it.   

{4:17} The thought of the floods of the sea came likewise to nought,for the sand stood up and stopped them.   

{4:18} If thou wert judge now betwixt these two, whom wouldest thoubegin to justify? or whom wouldest thou condemn?   

{4:19} I answered and said, Verily it is a foolish thought that theyboth have devised, for the ground is given unto the wood, and the seaalso hath his place to bear his floods.   

{4:20} Then answered he me, and said, Thou hast given a rightjudgment, but why judgest thou not thyself also?   

{4:21} For like as the ground is given unto the wood, and the sea tohis floods: even so they that dwell upon the earth may understandnothing but that which is upon the earth: and he that dwelleth abovethe heavens may only understand the things that are above the height ofthe heavens.   

{4:22} Then answered I and said, I beseech thee, O Lord, let me haveunderstanding:   

{4:23} For it was not my mind to be curious of the high things, butof such as pass by us daily, namely, wherefore Israel is given up as areproach to the heathen, and for what cause the people whom thou hastloved is given over unto ungodly nations, and why the law of ourforefathers is brought to nought, and the written covenants come tonone effect,   

{4:24} And we pass away out of the world as grasshoppers, and ourlife is astonishment and fear, and we are not worthy to obtain mercy.   

{4:25} What will he then do unto his name whereby we are called? ofthese things have I asked.   

{4:26} Then answered he me, and said, The more thou searchest, themore thou shalt marvel; for the world hasteth fast to pass away,   

{4:27} And cannot comprehend the things that are promised to therighteous in time to come: for this world is full of unrighteousnessand infirmities.   

{4:28} But as concerning the things whereof thou askest me, I willtell thee; for the evil is sown, but the destruction thereof is not yetcome.   

{4:29} If therefore that which is sown be not turned upside down,and if the place where the evil is sown pass not away, then cannot itcome that is sown with good.   

{4:30} For the grain of evil seed hath been sown in the heart ofAdam from the beginning, and how much ungodliness hath it brought upunto this time? and how much shall it yet bring forth until the time ofthreshing come?   

{4:31} Ponder now by thyself, how great fruit of wickedness thegrain of evil seed hath brought forth.   

{4:32} And when the ears shall be cut down, which are withoutnumber, how great a floor shall they fill?   

{4:33} Then I answered and said, How, and when shall these thingscome to pass? wherefore are our years few and evil?   

{4:34} And he answered me, saying, Do not thou hasten above the mostHighest: for thy haste is in vain to be above him, for thou hast muchexceeded.   

{4:35} Did not the souls also of the righteous ask question of thesethings in their chambers, saying, How long shall I hope on thisfashion? when cometh the fruit of the floor of our reward?   

{4:36} And unto these things Uriel the archangel gave them answer,and said, Even when the number of seeds is filled in you: for he hathweighed the world in the balance.   

{4:37} By measure hath he measured the times; and by number hath henumbered the times; and he doth not move nor stir them, until the saidmeasure be fulfilled.   

{4:38} Then answered I and said, O Lord that bearest rule, even weall are full of impiety.   

{4:39} And for our sakes peradventure it is that the floors of therighteous are not filled, because of the sins of them that dwell uponthe earth.   

{4:40} So he answered me, and said, Go thy way to a woman withchild, and ask of her when she hath fulfilled her nine months, if herwomb may keep the birth any longer within her.   

{4:41} Then said I, No, Lord, that can she not. And he said unto me,In the grave the chambers of souls are like the womb of a woman:   

{4:42} For like as a woman that travaileth maketh haste to escapethe necessity of the travail: even so do these places haste to deliverthose things that are committed unto them.   

{4:43} From the beginning, look, what thou desirest to see, it shallbe shewed thee.   

{4:44} Then answered I and said, If I have found favour in thysight, and if it be possible, and if I be meet therefore,   

{4:45} Shew me then whether there be more to come than is past, ormore past than is to come.   

{4:46} What is past I know, but what is for to come I know not.   

{4:47} And he said unto me, Stand up upon the right side, and Ishall expound the similitude unto thee.   

{4:48} So I stood, and saw, and, behold, an hot burning oven passedby before me: and it happened that when the flame was gone by I looked,and, behold, the smoke remained still.   

{4:49} After this there passed by before me a watery cloud, and sentdown much rain with a storm; and when the stormy rain was past, thedrops remained still.   

{4:50} Then said he unto me, Consider with thyself; as the rain ismore than the drops, and as the fire is greater than the smoke; but thedrops and the smoke remain behind: so the quantity which is past didmore exceed.   

{4:51} Then I prayed, and said, May I live, thinkest thou, untilthat time? or what shall happen in those days?   

{4:52} He answered me, and said, As for the tokens whereof thouaskest me, I may tell thee of them in part: but as touching thy life, Iam not sent to shew thee; for I do not know it.   

{5:1} Nevertheless as coming the tokens, behold, the days shallcome, that they which dwell upon earth shall be taken in a greatnumber, and the way of truth shall be hidden, and the land shall bebarren of faith.   

{5:2} But iniquity shall be increased above that which now thouseest, or that thou hast heard long ago.   

{5:3} And the land, that thou seest now to have root, shalt thou seewasted suddenly.   

{5:4} But if the most High grant thee to live, thou shalt see afterthe third trumpet that the sun shall suddenly shine again in the night,and the moon thrice in the day:   

{5:5} And blood shall drop out of wood, and the stone shall give hisvoice, and the people shall be troubled:   

{5:6} And even he shall rule, whom they look not for that dwell uponthe earth, and the fowls shall take their flight away together:   

{5:7} And the Sodomitish sea shall cast out fish, and make a noisein the night, which many have not known: but they shall all hear thevoice thereof.   

{5:8} There shall be a confusion also in many places, and the fireshall be oft sent out again, and the wild beasts shall change theirplaces, and menstruous women shall bring forth monsters:   

{5:9} And salt waters shall be found in the sweet, and all friendsshall destroy one another; then shall wit hide itself, andunderstanding withdraw itself into his secret chamber,   

{5:10} And shall be sought of many, and yet not be found: then shallunrighteousness and incontinency be multiplied upon earth.   

{5:11} One land also shall ask another, and say, Is righteousnessthat maketh a man righteous gone through thee? And it shall say, No.   

{5:12} At the same time shall men hope, but nothing obtain: theyshall labour, but their ways shall not prosper.   

{5:13} To shew thee such tokens I have leave; and if thou wilt prayagain, and weep as now, and fast even days, thou shalt hear yet greaterthings.   

{5:14} Then I awaked, and an extreme fearfulness went through all mybody, and my mind was troubled, so that it fainted.   

{5:15} So the angel that was come to talk with me held me, comfortedme, and set me up upon my feet.   

{5:16} And in the second night it came to pass, that Salathiel thecaptain of the people came unto me, saying, Where hast thou been? andwhy is thy countenance so heavy?   

{5:17} Knowest thou not that Israel is committed unto thee in theland of their captivity?   

{5:18} Up then, and eat bread, and forsake us not, as the shepherdthat leaveth his flock in the hands of cruel wolves.   

{5:19} Then said I unto him, Go thy ways from me, and come not nighme. And he heard what I said, and went from me.   

{5:20} And so I fasted seven days, mourning and weeping, like asUriel the angel commanded me.   

{5:21} And after seven days so it was, that the thoughts of my heartwere very grievous unto me again,   

{5:22} And my soul recovered the spirit of understanding, and Ibegan to talk with the most High again,   

{5:23} And said, O Lord that bearest rule, of every wood of theearth, and of all the trees thereof, thou hast chosen thee one onlyvine:   

{5:24} And of all lands of the whole world thou hast chosen thee onepit: and of all the flowers thereof one lily:   

{5:25} And of all the depths of the sea thou hast filled thee oneriver: and of all builded cities thou hast hallowed Sion unto thyself:   

{5:26} And of all the fowls that are created thou hast named theeone dove: and of all the cattle that are made thou hast provided theeone sheep:   

{5:27} And among all the multitudes of people thou hast gotten theeone people: and unto this people, whom thou lovedst, thou gavest a lawthat is approved of all.   

{5:28} And now, O Lord, why hast thou given this one people overunto many? and upon the one root hast thou prepared others, and whyhast thou scattered thy only one people among many?   

{5:29} And they which did gainsay thy promises, and believed not thycovenants, have trodden them down.   

{5:30} If thou didst so much hate thy people, yet shouldest thoupunish them with thine own hands.   

{5:31} Now when I had spoken these words, the angel that came to methe night afore was sent unto me,   

{5:32} And said unto me, Hear me, and I will instruct thee; hearkento the thing that I say, and I shall tell thee more.   

{5:33} And I said, Speak on, my Lord. Then said he unto me, Thou artsore troubled in mind for Israel's sake: lovest thou that people betterthan he that made them?   

{5:34} And I said, No, Lord: but of very grief have I spoken: for myreins pain me every hour, while I labour to comprehend the way of themost High, and to seek out part of his judgment.   

{5:35} And he said unto me, Thou canst not. And I said, Wherefore,Lord? whereunto was I born then? or why was not my mother's womb thenmy grave, that I might not have seen the travail of Jacob, and thewearisome toil of the stock of Israel?   

{5:36} And he said unto me, Number me the things that are not yetcome, gather me together the dross that are scattered abroad, make methe flowers green again that are withered,   

{5:37} Open me the places that are closed, and bring me forth thewinds that in them are shut up, shew me the image of a voice: and thenI will declare to thee the thing that thou labourest to know.   

{5:38} And I said, O Lord that bearest rule, who may know thesethings, but he that hath not his dwelling with men?   

{5:39} As for me, I am unwise: how may I then speak of these thingswhereof thou askest me?   

{5:40} Then said he unto me, Like as thou canst do none of thesethings that I have spoken of, even so canst thou not find out myjudgment, or in the end the love that I have promised unto my people.   

{5:41} And I said, Behold, O Lord, yet art thou nigh unto them thatbe reserved till the end: and what shall they do that have been beforeme, or we that be now, or they that shall come after us?   

{5:42} And he said unto me, I will liken my judgment unto a ring:like as there is no slackness of the last, even so there is noswiftness of the first.   

{5:43} So I answered and said, Couldest thou not make those thathave been made, and be now, and that are for to come, at once; thatthou mightest shew thy judgment the sooner?   

{5:44} Then answered he me, and said, The creature may not hasteabove the maker; neither may the world hold them at once that shall becreated therein.   

{5:45} And I said, As thou hast said unto thy servant, that thou,which givest life to all, hast given life at once to the creature thatthou hast created, and the creature bare it: even so it might now alsobear them that now be present at once.   

{5:46} And he said unto me, Ask the womb of a woman, and say untoher, If thou bringest forth children, why dost thou it not together,but one after another? pray her therefore to bring forth ten childrenat once.   

{5:47} And I said, She cannot: but must do it by distance of time.   

{5:48} Then said he unto me, Even so have I given the womb of theearth to those that be sown in it in their times.   

{5:49} For like as a young child may not bring forth the things thatbelong to the aged, even so have I disposed the world which I created.   

{5:50} And I asked, and said, Seeing thou hast now given me the way,I will proceed to speak before thee: for our mother, of whom thou hasttold me that she is young, draweth now nigh unto age.   

{5:51} He answered me, and said, Ask a woman that beareth children,and she shall tell thee.   

{5:52} Say unto her, Wherefore are unto they whom thou hast nowbrought forth like those that were before, but less of stature?   

{5:53} And she shall answer thee, They that be born in the thestrength of youth are of one fashion, and they that are born in thetime of age, when the womb faileth, are otherwise.   

{5:54} Consider thou therefore also, how that ye are less of staturethan those that were before you.   

{5:55} And so are they that come after you less than ye, as thecreatures which now begin to be old, and have passed over the strengthof youth.   

{5:56} Then said I, Lord, I beseech thee, if I have found favour inthy sight, shew thy servant by whom thou visitest thy creature.   

{6:1} And he said unto me, In the beginning, when the earth wasmade, before the borders of the world stood, or ever the winds blew,   

{6:2} Before it thundered and lightened, or ever the foundations ofparadise were laid,   

{6:3} Before the fair flowers were seen, or ever the moveable powerswere established, before the innumerable multitude of angels weregathered together,   

{6:4} Or ever the heights of the air were lifted up, before themeasures of the firmament were named, or ever the chimneys in Sion werehot,   

{6:5} And ere the present years were sought out, and or ever theinventions of them that now sin were turned, before they were sealedthat have gathered faith for a treasure:   

{6:6} Then did I consider these things, and they all were madethrough me alone, and through none other: by me also they shall beended, and by none other.   

{6:7} Then answered I and said, What shall be the parting asunder ofthe times? or when shall be the end of the first, and the beginning ofit that followeth?   

{6:8} And he said unto me, From Abraham unto Isaac, when Jacob andEsau were born of him, Jacob's hand held first the heel of Esau.   

{6:9} For Esau is the end of the world, and Jacob is the beginningof it that followeth.   

{6:10} The hand of man is betwixt the heel and the hand: otherquestion, Esdras, ask thou not.   

{6:11} I answered then and said, O Lord that bearest rule, if I havefound favour in thy sight,   

{6:12} I beseech thee, shew thy servant the end of thy tokens,whereof thou shewedst me part the last night.   

{6:13} So he answered and said unto me, Stand up upon thy feet, andhear a mighty sounding voice.   

{6:14} And it shall be as it were a great motion; but the placewhere thou standest shall not be moved.   

{6:15} And therefore when it speaketh be not afraid: for the word isof the end, and the foundation of the earth is understood.   

{6:16} And why? because the speech of these things trembleth and ismoved: for it knoweth that the end of these things must be changed.   

{6:17} And it happened, that when I had heard it I stood up upon myfeet, and hearkened, and, behold, there was a voice that spake, and thesound of it was like the sound of many waters.   

{6:18} And it said, Behold, the days come, that I will begin to drawnigh, and to visit them that dwell upon the earth,   

{6:19} And will begin to make inquisition of them, what they be thathave hurt unjustly with their unrighteousness, and when the afflictionof Sion shall be fulfilled;   

{6:20} And when the world, that shall begin to vanish away, shall befinished, then will I shew these tokens: the books shall be openedbefore the firmament, and they shall see all together:   

{6:21} And the children of a year old shall speak with their voices,the women with child shall bring forth untimely children of three orfour months old, and they shall live, and be raised up.   

{6:22} And suddenly shall the sown places appear unsown, the fullstorehouses shall suddenly be found empty:   

{6:23} And tha trumpet shall give a sound, which when every manheareth, they shall be suddenly afraid.   

{6:24} At that time shall friends fight one against another likeenemies, and the earth shall stand in fear with those that dwelltherein, the springs of the fountains shall stand still, and in threehours they shall not run.   

{6:25} Whosoever remaineth from all these that I have told theeshall escape, and see my salvation, and the end of your world.   

{6:26} And the men that are received shall see it, who have nottasted death from their birth: and the heart of the inhabitants shallbe changed, and turned into another meaning.   

{6:27} For evil shall be put out, and deceit shall be quenched.   

{6:28} As for faith, it shall flourish, corruption shall beovercome, and the truth, which hath been so long without fruit, shallbe declared.   

{6:29} And when he talked with me, behold, I looked by little andlittle upon him before whom I stood.   

{6:30} And these words said he unto me; I am come to shew thee thetime of the night to come.   

{6:31} If thou wilt pray yet more, and fast seven days again, Ishall tell thee greater things by day than I have heard.   

{6:32} For thy voice is heard before the most High: for the Mightyhath seen thy righteous dealing, he hath seen also thy chastity, whichthou hast had ever since thy youth.   

{6:33} And therefore hath he sent me to shew thee all these things,and to say unto thee, Be of good comfort and fear not   

{6:34} And hasten not with the times that are past, to think vainthings, that thou mayest not hasten from the latter times.   

{6:35} And it came to pass after this, that I wept again, and fastedseven days in like manner, that I might fulfil the three weeks which hetold me.   

{6:36} And in the eighth night was my heart vexed within me again,and I began to speak before the most High.   

{6:37} For my spirit was greatly set on fire, and my soul was indistress.   

{6:38} And I said, O Lord, thou spakest from the beginning of thecreation, even the first day, and saidst thus; Let heaven and earth bemade; and thy word was a perfect work.   

{6:39} And then was the spirit, and darkness and silence were onevery side; the sound of man's voice was not yet formed.   

{6:40} Then commandedst thou a fair light to come forth of thytreasures, that thy work might appear.   

{6:41} Upon the second day thou madest the spirit of the firmament,and commandedst it to part asunder, and to make a division betwixt thewaters, that the one part might go up, and the other remain beneath.   

{6:42} Upon the third day thou didst command that the waters shouldbe gathered in the seventh part of the earth: six pats hast thou driedup, and kept them, to the intent that of these some being planted ofGod and tilled might serve thee.   

{6:43} For as soon as thy word went forth the work was made.   

{6:44} For immediately there was great and innumerable fruit, andmany and divers pleasures for the taste, and flowers of unchangeablecolour, and odours of wonderful smell: and this was done the third day.   

{6:45} Upon the fourth day thou commandedst that the sun shouldshine, and the moon give her light, and the stars should be in order:   

{6:46} And gavest them a charge to do service unto man, that was tobe made.   

{6:47} Upon the fifth day thou saidst unto the seventh part, wherethe waters were gathered that it should bring forth living creatures,fowls and fishes: and so it came to pass.   

{6:48} For the dumb water and without life brought forth livingthings at the commandment of God, that all people might praise thywondrous works.   

{6:49} Then didst thou ordain two living creatures, the one thoucalledst Enoch, and the other Leviathan;   

{6:50} And didst separate the one from the other: for the seventhpart, namely, where the water was gathered together, might not holdthem both.   

{6:51} Unto Enoch thou gavest one part, which was dried up the thirdday, that he should dwell in the same part, wherein are a thousandhills:   

{6:52} But unto Leviathan thou gavest the seventh part, namely, themoist; and hast kept him to be devoured of whom thou wilt, and when.   

{6:53} Upon the sixth day thou gavest commandment unto the earth,that before thee it should bring forth beasts, cattle, and creepingthings:   

{6:54} And after these, Adam also, whom thou madest lord of all thycreatures: of him come we all, and the people also whom thou hastchosen.   

{6:55} All this have I spoken before thee, O Lord, because thoumadest the world for our sakes   

{6:56} As for the other people, which also come of Adam, thou hastsaid that they are nothing, but be like unto spittle: and hast likenedthe abundance of them unto a drop that falleth from a vessel.   

{6:57} And now, O Lord, behold, these heathen, which have ever beenreputed as nothing, have begun to be lords over us, and to devour us.   

{6:58} But we thy people, whom thou hast called thy firstborn, thyonly begotten, and thy fervent lover, are given into their hands.   

{6:59} If the world now be made for our sakes, why do we not possessan inheritance with the world? how long shall this endure?   

{7:1} And when I had made an end of speaking these words, there wassent unto me the angel which had been sent unto me the nights afore:   

{7:2} And he said unto me, Up, Esdras, and hear the words that I amcome to tell thee.   

{7:3} And I said, Speak on, my God. Then said he unto me, The sea isset in a wide place, that it might be deep and great.   

{7:4} But put the case the entrance were narrow, and like a river;   

{7:5} Who then could go into the sea to look upon it, and to ruleit? if he went not through the narrow, how could he come into the broad?   

{7:6} There is also another thing; A city is builded, and set upon abroad field, and is full of all good things:   

{7:7} The entrance thereof is narrow, and is set in a dangerousplace to fall, like as if there were a fire on the right hand, and onthe left a deep water:   

{7:8} And one only path between them both, even between the fire andthe water, so small that there could but one man go there at once.   

{7:9} If this city now were given unto a man for an inheritance, ifhe never shall pass the danger set before it, how shall he receive thisinheritance?   

{7:10} And I said, It is so, Lord. Then said he unto me, Even soalso is Israel's portion.   

{7:11} Because for their sakes I made the world: and when Adamtransgressed my statutes, then was decreed that now is done.   

{7:12} Then were the entrances of this world made narrow, full ofsorrow and travail: they are but few and evil, full of perils,: andvery painful.   

{7:13} For the entrances of the elder world were wide and sure, andbrought immortal fruit.   

{7:14} If then they that live labour not to enter these strait andvain things, they can never receive those that are laid up for them.   

{7:15} Now therefore why disquietest thou thyself, seeing thou artbut a corruptible man? and why art thou moved, whereas thou art butmortal?   

{7:16} Why hast thou not considered in thy mind this thing that isto come, rather than that which is present?   

{7:17} Then answered I and said, O Lord that bearest rule, thou hastordained in thy law, that the righteous should inherit these things,but that the ungodly should perish.   

{7:18} Nevertheless the righteous shall suffer strait things, andhope for wide: for they that have done wickedly have suffered thestrait things, and yet shall not see the wide.   

{7:19} And he said unto me. There is no judge above God, and nonethat hath understanding above the Highest.   

{7:20} For there be many that perish in this life, because theydespise the law of God that is set before them.   

{7:21} For God hath given strait commandment to such as came, whatthey should do to live, even as they came, and what they should observeto avoid punishment.   

{7:22} Nevertheless they were not obedient unto him; but spakeagainst him, and imagined vain things;   

{7:23} And deceived themselves by their wicked deeds; and said ofthe most High, that he is not; and knew not his ways:   

{7:24} But his law have they despised, and denied his covenants; inhis statutes have they not been faithful, and have not performed hisworks.   

{7:25} And therefore, Esdras, for the empty are empty things, andfor the full are the full things.   

{7:26} Behold, the time shall come, that these tokens which I havetold thee shall come to pass, and the bride shall appear, and shecoming forth shall be seen, that now is withdrawn from the earth.   

{7:27} And whosoever is delivered from the foresaid evils shall seemy wonders.   

{7:28} For my son Jesus shall be revealed with those that be withhim, and they that remain shall rejoice within four hundred years.   

{7:29} After these years shall my son Christ die, and all men thathave life.   

{7:30} And the world shall be turned into the old silence sevendays, like as in the former judgments: so that no man shall remain.   

{7:31} And after seven days the world, that yet awaketh not, shallbe raised up, and that shall die that is corrupt   

{7:32} And the earth shall restore those that are asleep in her, andso shall the dust those that dwell in silence, and the secret placesshall deliver those souls that were committed unto them.   

{7:33} And the most High shall appear upon the seat of judgment, andmisery shall pass away, and the long suffering shall have an end:   

{7:34} But judgment only shall remain, truth shall stand, and faithshall wax strong:   

{7:35} And the work shall follow, and the reward shall be shewed,and the good deeds shall be of force, and wicked deeds shall bear norule.   

{7:36} Then said I, Abraham prayed first for the Sodomites, andMoses for the fathers that sinned in the wilderness:   

{7:37} And Jesus after him for Israel in the time of Achan:   

{7:38} And Samuel and David for the destruction: and Solomon forthem that should come to the sanctuary:   

{7:39} And Helias for those that received rain; and for the dead,that he might live:   

{7:40} And Ezechias for the people in the time of Sennacherib: andmany for many.   

{7:41} Even so now, seeing corruption is grown up, and wickednessincreased, and the righteous have prayed for the ungodly: whereforeshall it not be so now also?   

{7:42} He answered me, and said, This present life is not the endwhere much glory doth abide; therefore have they prayed for the weak.   

{7:43} But the day of doom shall be the end of this time, and thebeginning of the immortality for to come, wherein corruption is past,   

{7:44} Intemperance is at an end, infidelity is cut off,righteousness is grown, and truth is sprung up.   

{7:45} Then shall no man be able to save him that is destroyed, norto oppress him that hath gotten the victory.   

{7:46} I answered then and said, This is my first and last saying,that it had been better not to have given the earth unto Adam: or else,when it was given him, to have restrained him from sinning.   

{7:47} For what profit is it for men now in this present time tolive in heaviness, and after death to look for punishment?   

{7:48} O thou Adam, what hast thou done? for though it was thou thatsinned, thou art not fallen alone, but we all that come of thee.   

{7:49} For what profit is it unto us, if there be promised us animmortal time, whereas we have done the works that bring death?   

{7:50} And that there is promised us an everlasting hope, whereasourselves being most wicked are made vain?   

{7:51} And that there are laid up for us dwellings of health andsafety, whereas we have lived wickedly?   

{7:52} And that the glory of the most High is kept to defend themwhich have led a wary life, whereas we have walked in the most wickedways of all?   

{7:53} And that there should be shewed a paradise, whose fruitendureth for ever, wherein is security and medicine, since we shall notenter into it?   

{7:54} (For we have walked in unpleasant places.)   

{7:55} And that the faces of them which have used abstinence shallshine above the stars, whereas our faces shall be blacker than darkness?   

{7:56} For while we lived and committed iniquity, we considered notthat we should begin to suffer for it after death.   

{7:57} Then answered he me, and said, This is the condition of thebattle, which man that is born upon the earth shall fight;   

{7:58} That, if he be overcome, he shall suffer as thou hast said:but if he get the victory, he shall receive the thing that I say.   

{7:59} For this is the life whereof Moses spake unto the peoplewhile he lived, saying, Choose thee life, that thou mayest live.   

{7:60} Nevertheless they believed not him, nor yet the prophetsafter him, no nor me which have spoken unto them,   

{7:61} That there should not be such heaviness in their destruction,as shall be joy over them that are persuaded to salvation.   

{7:62} I answered then, and said, I know, Lord, that the most Highis called merciful, in that he hath mercy upon them which are not yetcome into the world,   

{7:63} And upon those also that turn to his law;   

{7:64} And that he is patient, and long suffereth those that havesinned, as his creatures;   

{7:65} And that he is bountiful, for he is ready to give where itneedeth;   

{7:66} And that he is of great mercy, for he multiplieth more andmore mercies to them that are present, and that are past, and also tothem which are to come.   

{7:67} For if he shall not multiply his mercies, the world would notcontinue with them that inherit therein.   

{7:68} And he pardoneth; for if he did not so of his goodness, thatthey which have committed iniquities might be eased of them, the tenthousandth part of men should not remain living.   

{7:69} And being judge, if he should not forgive them that are curedwith his word, and put out the multitude of contentions,   

{7:70} There should be very few left peradventure in an innumerablemultitude.   

{8:1} And he answered me, saying, The most High hath made this worldfor many, but the world to come for few.   

{8:2} I will tell thee a similitude, Esdras; As when thou askest theearth, it shall say unto thee, that it giveth much mould whereofearthen vessels are made, but little dust that gold cometh of: even sois the course of this present world.   

{8:3} There be many created, but few shall be saved.   

{8:4} So answered I and said, Swallow then down, O my soul,understanding, and devour wisdom.   

{8:5} For thou hast agreed to give ear, and art willing to prophesy:for thou hast no longer space than only to live.   

{8:6} O Lord, if thou suffer not thy servant, that we may praybefore thee, and thou give us seed unto our heart, and culture to ourunderstanding, that there may come fruit of it; how shall each man livethat is corrupt, who beareth the place of a man?   

{8:7} For thou art alone, and we all one workmanship of thine hands,like as thou hast said.   

{8:8} For when the body is fashioned now in the mother's womb, andthou givest it members, thy creature is preserved in fire and water,and nine months doth thy workmanship endure thy creature which iscreated in her.   

{8:9} But that which keepeth and is kept shall both be preserved:and when the time cometh, the womb preserved delivereth up the thingsthat grew in it.   

{8:10} For thou hast commanded out of the parts of the body, that isto say, out of the breasts, milk to be given, which is the fruit of thebreasts,   

{8:11} That the thing which is fashioned may be nourished for atime, till thou disposest it to thy mercy.   

{8:12} Thou broughtest it up with thy righteousness, and nurturedstit in thy law, and reformedst it with thy judgment.   

{8:13} And thou shalt mortify it as thy creature, and quicken it asthy work.   

{8:14} If therefore thou shalt destroy him which with so greatlabour was fashioned, it is an easy thing to be ordained by thycommandment, that the thing which was made might be preserved.   

{8:15} Now therefore, Lord, I will speak; touching man in general,thou knowest best; but touching thy people, for whose sake I am sorry;   

{8:16} And for thine inheritance, for whose cause I mourn; and forIsrael, for whom I am heavy; and for Jacob, for whose sake I amtroubled;   

{8:17} Therefore will I begin to pray before thee for myself and forthem: for I see the falls of us that dwell in the land.   

{8:18} But I have heard the swiftness of the judge which is to come.   

{8:19} Therefore hear my voice, and understand my words, and I shallspeak before thee. This is the beginning of the words of Esdras, beforehe was taken up: and I said,   

{8:20} O Lord, thou that dwellest in everlastingness which beholdestfrom above things in the heaven and in the air;   

{8:21} Whose throne is inestimable; whose glory may not becomprehended; before whom the hosts of angels stand with trembling,   

{8:22} Whose service is conversant in wind and fire; whose word istrue, and sayings constant; whose commandment is strong, and ordinancefearful;   

{8:23} Whose look drieth up the depths, and indignation maketh themountains to melt away; which the truth witnesseth:   

{8:24} O hear the prayer of thy servant, and give ear to thepetition of thy creature.   

{8:25} For while I live I will speak, and so long as I haveunderstanding I will answer.   

{8:26} O look not upon the sins of thy people; but on them whichserve thee in truth.   

{8:27} Regard not the wicked inventions of the heathen, but thedesire of those that keep thy testimonies in afflictions.   

{8:28} Think not upon those that have walked feignedly before thee:but remember them, which according to thy will have known thy fear.   

{8:29} Let it not be thy will to destroy them which have lived likebeasts; but to look upon them that have clearly taught thy law.   

{8:30} Take thou no indignation at them which are deemed worse thanbeasts; but love them that always put their trust in thy righteousnessand glory.   

{8:31} For we and our fathers do languish of such diseases: butbecause of us sinners thou shalt be called merciful.   

{8:32} For if thou hast a desire to have mercy upon us, thou shaltbe called merciful, to us namely, that have no works of righteousness.   

{8:33} For the just, which have many good works laid up with thee,shall out of their own deeds receive reward.   

{8:34} For what is man, that thou shouldest take displeasure at him?or what is a corruptible generation, that thou shouldest be so bittertoward it?   

{8:35} For in truth them is no man among them that be born, but hehath dealt wickedly; and among the faithful there is none which hathnot done amiss.   

{8:36} For in this, O Lord, thy righteousness and thy goodness shallbe declared, if thou be merciful unto them which have not theconfidence of good works.   

{8:37} Then answered he me, and said, Some things hast thou spokenaright, and according unto thy words it shall be.   

{8:38} For indeed I will not think on the disposition of them whichhave sinned before death, before judgment, before destruction:   

{8:39} But I will rejoice over the disposition of the righteous, andI will remember also their pilgrimage, and the salvation, and thereward, that they shall have.   

{8:40} Like as I have spoken now, so shall it come to pass.   

{8:41} For as the husbandman soweth much seed upon the ground, andplanteth many trees, and yet the thing that is sown good in his seasoncometh not up, neither doth all that is planted take root: even so isit of them that are sown in the world; they shall not all be saved.   

{8:42} I answered then and said, If I have found grace, let me speak.   

{8:43} Like as the husbandman's seed perisheth, if it come not up,and receive not thy rain in due season; or if there come too much rain,and corrupt it:   

{8:44} Even so perisheth man also, which is formed with thy hands,and is called thine own image, because thou art like unto him, forwhose sake thou hast made all things, and likened him unto thehusbandman's seed.   

{8:45} Be not wroth with us but spare thy people, and have mercyupon thine own inheritance: for thou art merciful unto thy creature.   

{8:46} Then answered he me, and said, Things present are for thepresent, and things to cometh for such as be to come.   

{8:47} For thou comest far short that thou shouldest be able to lovemy creature more than I: but I have ofttimes drawn nigh unto thee, andunto it, but never to the unrighteous.   

{8:48} In this also thou art marvellous before the most High:   

{8:49} In that thou hast humbled thyself, as it becometh thee, andhast not judged thyself worthy to be much glorified among the righteous.   

{8:50} For many great miseries shall be done to them that in thelatter time shall dwell in the world, because they have walked in greatpride.   

{8:51} But understand thou for thyself, and seek out the glory forsuch as be like thee.   

{8:52} For unto you is paradise opened, the tree of life is planted,the time to come is prepared, plenteousness is made ready, a city isbuilded, and rest is allowed, yea, perfect goodness and wisdom.   

{8:53} The root of evil is sealed up from you, weakness and the mothis hid from you, and corruption is fled into hell to be forgotten:   

{8:54} Sorrows are passed, and in the end is shewed the treasure ofimmortality.   

{8:55} And therefore ask thou no more questions concerning themultitude of them that perish.   

{8:56} For when they had taken liberty, they despised the most High,thought scorn of his law, and forsook his ways.   

{8:57} Moreover they have trodden down his righteous,   

{8:58} And said in their heart, that there is no God; yea, and thatknowing they must die.   

{8:59} For as the things aforesaid shalt receive you, so thirst andpain are prepared for them: for it was not his will that men shouldcome to nought:   

{8:60} But they which be created have defiled the name of him thatmade them, and were unthankful unto him which prepared life for them.   

{8:61} And therefore is my judgment now at hand.   

{8:62} These things have I not shewed unto all men, but unto thee,and a few like thee. Then answered I and said,   

{8:63} Behold, O Lord, now hast thou shewed me the multitude of thewonders, which thou wilt begin to do in the last times: but at whattime, thou hast not shewed me.   

{9:1} He answered me then, and said, Measure thou the timediligently in itself: and when thou seest part of the signs past, whichI have told thee before,   

{9:2} Then shalt thou understand, that it is the very same time,wherein the Highest will begin to visit the world which he made.   

{9:3} Therefore when there shall be seen earthquakes and uproars ofthe people in the world:   

{9:4} Then shalt thou well understand, that the most High spake ofthose things from the days that were before thee, even from thebeginning.   

{9:5} For like as all that is made in the world hath a beginning andan end, and the end is manifest:   

{9:6} Even so the times also of the Highest have plain beginnings inwonder and powerful works, and endings in effects and signs.   

{9:7} And every one that shall be saved, and shall be able to escapeby his works, and by faith, whereby ye have believed,   

{9:8} Shall be preserved from the said perils, and shall see mysalvation in my land, and within my borders: for I have sanctified themfor me from the beginning.   

{9:9} Then shall they be in pitiful case, which now have abused myways: and they that have cast them away despitefully shall dwell intorments.   

{9:10} For such as in their life have received benefits, and havenot known me;   

{9:11} And they that have loathed my law, while they had yetliberty, and, when as yet place of repentance was open unto them,understood not, but despised it;   

{9:12} The same must know it after death by pain.   

{9:13} And therefore be thou not curious how the ungodly shall bepunished, and when: but enquire how the righteous shall be saved, whosethe world is, and for whom the world is created.   

{9:14} Then answered I and said,   

{9:15} I have said before, and now do speak, and will speak it alsohereafter, that there be many more of them which perish, than of themwhich shall be saved:   

{9:16} Like as a wave is greater than a drop.   

{9:17} And he answered me, saying, Like as the field is, so is alsothe seed; as the flowers be, such are the colours also; such as theworkman is, such also is the work; and as the husbandman ls himself, sois his husbandry also: for it was the time of the world.   

{9:18} And now when I prepared the world, which was not yet made,even for them to dwell in that now live, no man spake against me.   

{9:19} For then every one obeyed: but now the manners of them whichare created in this world that is made are corrupted by a perpetualseed, and by a law which is unsearchable rid themselves.   

{9:20} So I considered the world, and, behold, there was perilbecause of the devices that were come into it.   

{9:21} And I saw, and spared it greatly, and have kept me a grape ofthe cluster, and a plant of a great people.   

{9:22} Let the multitude perish then, which was born in vain; andlet my grape be kept, and my plant; for with great labour have I madeit perfect.   

{9:23} Nevertheless, if thou wilt cease yet seven days more, (butthou shalt not fast in them,   

{9:24} But go into a field of flowers, where no house is builded,and eat only the flowers of the field; taste no flesh, drink no wine,but eat flowers only;)   

{9:25} And pray unto the Highest continually, then will I come andtalk with thee.   

{9:26} So I went my way into the field which is called Ardath, likeas he commanded me; and there I sat among the flowers, and did eat ofthe herbs of the field, and the meat of the same satisfied me.   

{9:27} After seven days I sat upon the grass, and my heart was vexedwithin me, like as before:   

{9:28} And I opened my mouth, and began to talk before the mostHigh, and said,   

{9:29} O Lord, thou that shewest thyself unto us, thou wast shewedunto our fathers in the wilderness, in a place where no man treadeth,in a barren place, when they came out of Egypt.   

{9:30} And thou spakest saying, Hear me, O Israel; and mark mywords, thou seed of Jacob.   

{9:31} For, behold, I sow my law in you, and it shall bring fruit inyou, and ye shall be honoured in it for ever.   

{9:32} But our fathers, which received the law, kept it not, andobserved not thy ordinances: and though the fruit of thy law did notperish, neither could it, for it was thine;   

{9:33} Yet they that received it perished, because they kept not thething that was sown in them.   

{9:34} And, lo, it ls a custom, when the ground hath received seed,or the sea a ship, or any vessel meat or drink, that, that beingperished wherein it was sown or cast into,   

{9:35} That thing also which was sown, or cast therein, or received,doth perish, and remaineth not with us: but with us it hath nothappened so.   

{9:36} For we that have received the law perish by sin, and ourheart also which received it   

{9:37} Notwithstanding the law perisheth not, but remaineth in hisforce.   

{9:38} And when I spake these things in my heart, I looked back withmine eyes, and upon the right side I saw a woman, and, behold, shemourned and wept with a loud voice, and was much grieved in heart, andher clothes were rent, and she had ashes upon her head.   

{9:39} Then let I my thoughts go that I was in, and turned me untoher,   

{9:40} And said unto her, Wherefore weepest thou? why art thou sogrieved in thy mind?   

{9:41} And she said unto me, Sir, let me alone, that I may bewailmyself, and add unto my sorrow, for I am sore vexed in my mind, andbrought very low.   

{9:42} And I said unto her, What aileth thee? tell me.   

{9:43} She said unto me, I thy servant have been barren, and had nochild, though I had an husband thirty years,   

{9:44} And those thirty years I did nothing else day and night, andevery hour, but make my, prayer to the Highest.   

{9:45} After thirty years God heard me thine handmaid, looked uponmy misery, considered my trouble, and gave me a son: and I was veryglad of him, so was my husband also, and all my neighbours: and we gavegreat honour unto the Almighty.   

{9:46} And I nourished him with great travail.   

{9:47} So when he grew up, and came to the time that he should havea wife, I made a feast.   

{10:1} And it so came to pass, that when my son was entered into hiswedding chamber, he fell down, and died.   

{10:2} Then we all overthrew the lights, and all my neighbours roseup to comfort me: so I took my rest unto the second day at night.   

{10:3} And it came to pass, when they had all left off to comfortme, to the end I might be quiet; then rose I up by night and fled, andcame hither into this field, as thou seest.   

{10:4} And I do now purpose not to return into the city, but here tostay, and neither to eat nor drink, but continually to mourn and tofast until I die.   

{10:5} Then left I the meditations wherein I was, and spake to herin anger, saying,   

{10:6} Thou foolish woman above all other, seest thou not ourmourning, and what happeneth unto us?   

{10:7} How that Sion our mother is full of all heaviness, and muchhumbled, mourning very sore?   

{10:8} And now, seeing we all mourn and are sad, for we are all inheaviness, art thou grieved for one son?   

{10:9} For ask the earth, and she shall tell thee, that it is shewhich ought to mourn for the fall of so many that grow upon her.   

{10:10} For out of her came all at the first, and out of her shallall others come, and, behold, they walk almost all into destruction,and a multitude of them is utterly rooted out.   

{10:11} Who then should make more mourning than she, that hath lostso great a multitude; and not thou, which art sorry but for one?   

{10:12} But if thou sayest unto me, My lamentation is not like theearth's, because I have lost the fruit of my womb, which I broughtforth with pains, and bare with sorrows;   

{10:13} But the earth not so: for the multitude present in itaccording to the course of the earth is gone, as it came:   

{10:14} Then say I unto thee, Like as thou hast brought forth withlabour; even so the earth also hath given her fruit, namely, man, eversince the beginning unto him that made her.   

{10:15} Now therefore keep thy sorrow to thyself, and bear with agood courage that which hath befallen thee.   

{10:16} For if thou shalt acknowledge the determination of God to bejust, thou shalt both receive thy son in time, and shalt be commendedamong women.   

{10:17} Go thy way then into the city to thine husband.   

{10:18} And she said unto me, That will I not do: I will not go intothe city, but here will I die.   

{10:19} So I proceeded to speak further unto her, and said,   

{10:20} Do not so, but be counselled. by me: for how many are theadversities of Sion? be comforted in regard of the sorrow of Jerusalem.   

{10:21} For thou seest that our sanctuary is laid waste, our altarbroken down, our temple destroyed;   

{10:22} Our psaltery is laid on the ground, our song is put tosilence, our rejoicing is at an end, the light of our candlestick isput out, the ark of our covenant is spoiled, our holy things aredefiled, and the name that is called upon us is almost profaned: ourchildren are put to shame, our priests are burnt, our Levites are goneinto captivity, our virgins are defiled, and our wives ravished; ourrighteous men carried away, our little ones destroyed, our young menare brought in bondage, and our strong men are become weak;   

{10:23} And, which is the greatest of all, the seal of Sion hath nowlost her honour; for she is delivered into the hands of them that hateus.   

{10:24} And therefore shake off thy great heaviness, and put awaythe multitude of sorrows, that the Mighty may be merciful unto theeagain, and the Highest shall give thee rest and ease from thy labour.   

{10:25} And it came to pass while I was talking with her, behold,her face upon a sudden shined exceedingly, and her countenanceglistered, so that I was afraid of her, and mused what it might be.   

{10:26} And, behold, suddenly she made a great cry very fearful: sothat the earth shook at the noise of the woman.   

{10:27} And I looked, and, behold, the woman appeared unto me nomore, but there was a city builded, and a large place shewed itselffrom the foundations: then was I afraid, and cried with a loud voice,and said,   

{10:28} Where is Uriel the angel, who came unto me at the first? forhe hath caused me to fall into many trances, and mine end is turnedinto corruption, and my prayer to rebuke.   

{10:29} And as I was speaking these words behold, he came unto me,and looked upon me.   

{10:30} And, lo, I lay as one that had been dead, and mineunderstanding was taken from me: and he took me by the right hand, andcomforted me, and set me upon my feet, and said unto me,   

{10:31} What aileth thee? and why art thou so disquieted? and why isthine understanding troubled, and the thoughts of thine heart?   

{10:32} And I said, Because thou hast forsaken me, and yet I didaccording to thy words, and I went into the field, and, lo, I haveseen, and yet see, that I am not able to express.   

{10:33} And he said unto me, Stand up manfully, and I will advisethee.   

{10:34} Then said I, Speak on, my lord, in me; only forsake me not,lest I die frustrate of my hope.   

{10:35} For I have seen that I knew not, and hear that I do not know.   

{10:36} Or is my sense deceived, or my soul in a dream?   

{10:37} Now therefore I beseech thee that thou wilt shew thy servantof this vision.   

{10:38} He answered me then, and said, Hear me, and I shall informthee, and tell thee wherefore thou art afraid: for the Highest willreveal many secret things unto thee.   

{10:39} He hath seen that thy way is right: for that thou sorrowestcontinually for thy people, and makest great lamentation for Sion.   

{10:40} This therefore is the meaning of the vision which thoulately sawest:   

{10:41} Thou sawest a woman mourning, and thou begannest to comforther:   

{10:42} But now seest thou the likeness of the woman no more, butthere appeared unto thee a city builded.   

{10:43} And whereas she told thee of the death of her son, this isthe solution:   

{10:44} This woman, whom thou sawest is Sion: and whereas she saidunto thee, even she whom thou seest as a city builded,   

{10:45} Whereas, I say, she said unto thee, that she hath beenthirty years barren: those are the thirty years wherein there was nooffering made in her.   

{10:46} But after thirty years Solomon builded the city and offeredofferings: and then bare the barren a son.   

{10:47} And whereas she told thee that she nourished him withlabour: that was the dwelling in Jerusalem.   

{10:48} But whereas she said unto thee, That my son coming into hismarriage chamber happened to have a fail, and died: this was thedestruction that came to Jerusalem.   

{10:49} And, behold, thou sawest her likeness, and because shemourned for her son, thou begannest to comfort her: and of these thingswhich have chanced, these are to be opened unto thee.   

{10:50} For now the most High seeth that thou art grievedunfeignedly, and sufferest from thy whole heart for her, so hath heshewed thee the brightness of her glory, and the comeliness of herbeauty:   

{10:51} And therefore I bade thee remain in the field where no housewas builded:   

{10:52} For I knew that the Highest would shew this unto thee.   

{10:53} Therefore I commanded thee to go into the field, where nofoundation of any building was.   

{10:54} For in the place wherein the Highest beginneth to shew hiscity, there can no man's building be able to stand.   

{10:55} And therefore fear not, let not thine heart be affrighted,but go thy way in, and see the beauty and greatness of the building, asmuch as thine eyes be able to see:   

{10:56} And then shalt thou hear as much as thine ears maycomprehend.   

{10:57} For thou art blessed above many other, and art called withthe Highest; and so are but few.   

{10:58} But to morrow at night thou shalt remain here;   

{10:59} And so shall the Highest shew thee visions of the highthings, which the most High will do unto them that dwell upon the earthin the last days. So I slept that night and another, like as hecommanded me.   

{11:1} Then saw I a dream, and, behold, there came up from the seaan eagle, which had twelve feathered wings, and three heads.   

{11:2} And I saw, and, behold, she spread her wings over all theearth, and all the winds of the air blew on her, and were gatheredtogether.   

{11:3} And I beheld, and out of her feathers there grew othercontrary feathers; and they became little feathers and small.   

{11:4} But her heads were at rest: the head in the midst was greaterthan the other, yet rested it with the residue.   

{11:5} Moreover I beheld, and, lo, the eagle flew with her feathers,and reigned upon earth, and over them that dwelt therein.   

{11:6} And I saw that all things under heaven were subject unto her,and no man spake against her, no, not one creature upon earth.   

{11:7} And I beheld, and, lo, the eagle rose upon her talons, andspake to her feathers, saying,   

{11:8} Watch not all at once: sleep every one in his own place, andwatch by course:   

{11:9} But let the heads be preserved for the last.   

{11:10} And I beheld, and, lo, the voice went not out of her heads,but from the midst of her body.   

{11:11} And I numbered her contrary feathers, and, behold, therewere eight of them.   

{11:12} And I looked, and, behold, on the right side there arose onefeather, and reigned over all the earth;   

{11:13} And so it was, that when it reigned, the end of it came, andthe place thereof appeared no more: so the next following stood up. andreigned, and had a great time;   

{11:14} And it happened, that when it reigned, the end of it camealso, like as the first, so that it appeared no more.   

{11:15} Then came there a voice unto it, and said,   

{11:16} Hear thou that hast borne rule over the earth so long: thisI say unto thee, before thou beginnest to appear no more,   

{11:17} There shall none after thee attain unto thy time, neitherunto the half thereof.   

{11:18} Then arose the third, and reigned as the other before, andappeared no more also.   

{11:19} So went it with all the residue one after another, as thatevery one reigned, and then appeared no more.   

{11:20} Then I beheld, and, lo, in process of time the feathers thatfollowed stood up upon the right side, that they might rule also; andsome of them ruled, but within a while they appeared no more:   

{11:21} For some of them were set up, but ruled not.   

{11:22} After this I looked, and, behold, the twelve feathersappeared no more, nor the two little feathers:   

{11:23} And there was no more upon the eagle's body, but three headsthat rested, and six little wings.   

{11:24} Then saw I also that two little feathers divided themselvesfrom the six, and remained under the head that was upon the right side:for the four continued in their place.   

{11:25} And I beheld, and, lo, the feathers that were under the wingthought to set up themselves and to have the rule.   

{11:26} And I beheld, and, lo, there was one set up, but shortly itappeared no more.   

{11:27} And the second was sooner away than the first.   

{11:28} And I beheld, and, lo, the two that remained thought also inthemselves to reign:   

{11:29} And when they so thought, behold, there awaked one of theheads that were at rest, namely, it that was in the midst; for that wasgreater than the two other heads.   

{11:30} And then I saw that the two other heads were joined with it.   

{11:31} And, behold, the head was turned with them that were withit, and did eat up the two feathers under the wing that would havereigned.   

{11:32} But this head put the whole earth in fear, and bare rule init over all those that dwelt upon the earth with much oppression; andit had the governance of the world more than all the wings that hadbeen.   

{11:33} And after this I beheld, and, lo, the head that was in themidst suddenly appeared no more, like as the wings.   

{11:34} But there remained the two heads, which also in like sortruled upon the earth, and over those that dwelt therein.   

{11:35} And I beheld, and, lo, the head upon the right side devouredit that was upon the left side.   

{11:36} Then I head a voice, which said unto me, Look before thee,and consider the thing that thou seest.   

{11:37} And I beheld, and lo, as it were a roaring lion chased outof the wood: and I saw that he sent out a man's voice unto the eagle,and said,   

{11:38} Hear thou, I will talk with thee, and the Highest shall sayunto thee,   

{11:39} Art not thou it that remainest of the four beasts, whom Imade to reign in my world, that the end of their times might comethrough them?   

{11:40} And the fourth came, and overcame all the beasts that werepast, and had power over the world with great fearfulness, and over thewhole compass of the earth with much wicked oppression; and so longtime dwelt he upon the earth with deceit.   

{11:41} For the earth hast thou not judged with truth.   

{11:42} For thou hast afflicted the meek, thou hast hurt thepeaceable, thou hast loved liars, and destroyed the dwellings of themthat brought forth fruit, and hast cast down the walls of such as didthee no harm.   

{11:43} Therefore is thy wrongful dealing come up unto the Highest,and thy pride unto the Mighty.   

{11:44} The Highest also hath looked upon the proud times, and,behold, they are ended, and his abominations are fulfilled.   

{11:45} And therefore appear no more, thou eagle, nor thy horriblewings, nor thy wicked feathers nor thy malicious heads, nor thy hurtfulclaws, nor all thy vain body:   

{11:46} That all the earth may be refreshed, and may return, beingdelivered from thy violence, and that she may hope for the judgment andmercy of him that made her.   

{12:1} And it came to pass, whiles the lion spake these words untothe eagle, I saw,   

{12:2} And, behold, the head that remained and the four wingsappeared no more, and the two went unto it and set themselves up toreign, and their kingdom was small, and fill of uproar.   

{12:3} And I saw, and, behold, they appeared no more, and the wholebody of the eagle was burnt so that the earth was in great fear: thenawaked I out of the trouble and trance of my mind, and from great fear,and said unto my spirit,   

{12:4} Lo, this hast thou done unto me, in that thou searchest outthe ways of the Highest.   

{12:5} Lo, yet am I weary in my mind, and very weak in my spirit;and little strength is there in me, for the great fear wherewith I wasafflicted this night.   

{12:6} Therefore will I now beseech the Highest, that he willcomfort me unto the end.   

{12:7} And I said, Lord that bearest rule, if I have found gracebefore thy sight, and if I am justified with thee before many others,and if my prayer indeed be come up before thy face;   

{12:8} Comfort me then, and shew me thy servant the interpretationand plain difference of this fearful vision, that thou mayest perfectlycomfort my soul.   

{12:9} For thou hast judged me worthy to shew me the last times.   

{12:10} And he said unto me, This is the interpretation of thevision:   

{12:11} The eagle, whom thou sawest come up from the sea, is thekingdom which was seen in the vision of thy brother Daniel.   

{12:12} But it was not expounded unto him, therefore now I declareit unto thee.   

{12:13} Behold, the days will come, that there shall rise up akingdom upon earth, and it shall be feared above all the kingdoms thatwere before it.   

{12:14} In the same shall twelve kings reign, one after another:   

{12:15} Whereof the second shall begin to reign, and shall have moretime than any of the twelve.   

{12:16} And this do the twelve wings signify, which thou sawest.   

{12:17} As for the voice which thou heardest speak, and that thousawest not to go out from the heads but from the midst of the bodythereof, this is the interpretation:   

{12:18} That after the time of that kingdom there shall arise greatstrivings, and it shall stand in peril of failing: nevertheless itshall not then fall, but shall be restored again to his beginning.   

{12:19} And whereas thou sawest the eight small under featherssticking to her wings, this is the interpretation:   

{12:20} That in him there shall arise eight kings, whose times shallbe but small, and their years swift.   

{12:21} And two of them shall perish, the middle time approaching:four shall be kept until their end begin to approach: but two shall bekept unto the end.   

{12:22} And whereas thou sawest three heads resting, this is theinterpretation:   

{12:23} In his last days shall the most High raise up threekingdoms, and renew many things therein, and they shall have thedominion of the earth,   

{12:24} And of those that dwell therein, with much oppression, aboveall those that were before them: therefore are they called the heads ofthe eagle.   

{12:25} For these are they that shall accomplish his wickedness, andthat shall finish his last end.   

{12:26} And whereas thou sawest that the great head appeared nomore, it signifieth that one of them shall die upon his bed, and yetwith pain.   

{12:27} For the two that remain shall be slain with the sword.   

{12:28} For the sword of the one shall devour the other: but at thelast shall he fall through the sword himself.   

{12:29} And whereas thou sawest two feathers under the wings passingover the head that is on the right side;   

{12:30} It signifieth that these are they, whom the Highest hathkept unto their end: this is the small kingdom and full of trouble, asthou sawest.   

{12:31} And the lion, whom thou sawest rising up out of the wood,and roaring, and speaking to the eagle, and rebuking her for herunrighteousness with all the words which thou hast heard;   

{12:32} This is the anointed, which the Highest hath kept for themand for their wickedness unto the end: he shall reprove them, and shallupbraid them with their cruelty.   

{12:33} For he shall set them before him alive in judgment, andshall rebuke them, and correct them.   

{12:34} For the rest of my people shall he deliver with mercy, thosethat have been pressed upon my borders, and he shall make them joyfuluntil the coming of the day of judgment, whereof I have spoken untothee from the the beginning.   

{12:35} This is the dream that thou sawest, and these are theinterpretations.   

{12:36} Thou only hast been meet to know this secret of the Highest.   

{12:37} Therefore write all these things that thou hast seen in abook, and hide them:   

{12:38} And teach them to the wise of the people, whose hearts thouknowest may comprehend and keep these secrets.   

{12:39} But wait thou here thyself yet seven days more, that it maybe shewed thee, whatsoever it pleaseth the Highest to declare untothee. And with that he went his way.   

{12:40} And it came to pass, when all the people saw that the sevendays were past, and I not come again into the city, they gathered themall together, from the least unto the greatest, and came unto me, andsaid,   

{12:41} What have we offended thee? and what evil have we doneagainst thee, that thou forsakest us, and sittest here in this place?   

{12:42} For of all the prophets thou only art left us, as a clusterof the vintage, and as a candle in a dark place, and as a haven or shippreserved from the tempest.   

{12:43} Are not the evils which are come to us sufficient?   

{12:44} If thou shalt forsake us, how much better had it been forus, if we also had been burned in the midst of Sion?   

{12:45} For we are not better than they that died there. And theywept with a loud voice. Then answered I them, and said,   

{12:46} Be of good comfort, O Israel; and be not heavy, thou houseof Jacob:   

{12:47} For the Highest hath you in remembrance, and the Mighty hathnot forgotten you in temptation.   

{12:48} As for me, I have not forsaken you, neither am I departedfrom you: but am come into this place, to pray for the desolation ofSion, and that I might seek mercy for the low estate of your sanctuary.   

{12:49} And now go your way home every man, and after these dayswill I come unto you.   

{12:50} So the people went their way into the city, like as Icommanded them:   

{12:51} But I remained still in the field seven days, as the angelcommanded me; and did eat only in those days of the flowers of thefield, and had my meat of the herbs   

{13:1} And it came to pass after seven days, I dreamed a dream bynight:   

{13:2} And, lo, there arose a wind from the sea, that it moved allthe waves thereof.   

{13:3} And I beheld, and, lo, that man waxed strong with thethousands of heaven: and when he turned his countenance to look, allthe things trembled that were seen under him.   

{13:4} And whensoever the voice went out of his mouth, all theyburned that heard his voice, like as the earth faileth when it feeleththe fire.   

{13:5} And after this I beheld, and, lo, there was gathered togethera multitude of men, out of number, from the four winds of the heaven,to subdue the man that came out of the sea   

{13:6} But I beheld, and, lo, he had graved himself a greatmountain, and flew up upon it.   

{13:7} But I would have seen the region or place whereout the hillwas graven, and I could not.   

{13:8} And after this I beheld, and, lo, all they which weregathered together to subdue him were sore afraid, and yet durst fight.   

{13:9} And, lo, as he saw the violence of the multitude that came,he neither lifted up his hand, nor held sword, nor any instrument ofwar:   

{13:10} But only I saw that he sent out of his mouth as it had beena blast of fire, and out of his lips a flaming breath, and out of histongue he cast out sparks and tempests.   

{13:11} And they were all mixed together; the blast of fire, theflaming breath, and the great tempest; and fell with violence upon themultitude which was prepared to fight, and burned them up every one, sothat upon a sudden of an innumerable multitude nothing was to beperceived, but only dust and smell of smoke: when I saw this I wasafraid.   

{13:12} Afterward saw I the same man come down from the mountain,and call unto him another peaceable Multitude.   

{13:13} And there came much people unto him, whereof some were glad,some were sorry, and some of them were bound, and other some brought ofthem that were offered: then was I sick through great fear, and Iawaked, and said,   

{13:14} Thou hast shewed thy servant these wonders from thebeginning, and hast counted me worthy that thou shouldest receive myprayer:   

{13:15} Shew me now yet the interpretation of this dream.   

{13:16} For as I conceive in mine understanding, woe unto them thatshall be left in those days and much more woe unto them that are notleft behind!   

{13:17} For they that were not left were in heaviness.   

{13:18} Now understand I the things that are laid up in the latterdays, which shall happen unto them, and to those that are left behind.   

{13:19} Therefore are they come into great perils and manynecessities, like as these dreams declare.   

{13:20} Yet is it easier for him that is in danger to come intothese things, than to pass away as a cloud out of the world, and not tosee the things that happen in the last days. And he answered unto me,and said,   

{13:21} The interpretation of the vision shall I shew thee, and Iwill open unto thee the thing that thou hast required.   

{13:22} Whereas thou hast spoken of them that are left behind, thisis the interpretation:   

{13:23} He that shall endure the peril in that time hath kepthimself: they that be fallen into danger are such as have works, andfaith toward the Almighty.   

{13:24} Know this therefore, that they which be left behind are moreblessed than they that be dead.   

{13:25} This is the meaning of the vision: Whereas thou sawest a mancoming up from the midst of the sea:   

{13:26} The same is he whom God the Highest hath kept a greatseason, which by his own self shall deliver his creature: and he shallorder them that are left behind.   

{13:27} And whereas thou sawest, that out of his mouth there came asa blast of wind, and fire, and storm;   

{13:28} And that he held neither sword, nor any instrument of war,but that the rushing in of him destroyed the whole multitude that cameto subdue him; this is the interpretation:   

{13:29} Behold, the days come, when the most High will begin todeliver them that are upon the earth.   

{13:30} And he shall come to the astonishment of them that dwell onthe earth.   

{13:31} And one shall undertake to fight against another, one cityagainst another, one place against another, one people against another,and one realm against another.   

{13:32} And the time shall be when these things shall come to pass,and the signs shall happen which I shewed thee before, and then shallmy Son be declared, whom thou sawest as a man ascending.   

{13:33} And when all the people hear his voice, every man shall intheir own land leave the battle they have one against another.   

{13:34} And an innumerable multitude shall be gathered together, asthou sawest them, willing to come, and to overcome him by fighting.   

{13:35} But he shall stand upon the top of the mount Sion.   

{13:36} And Sion shall come, and shall be shewed to all men, beingprepared and builded, like as thou sawest the hill graven without hands.   

{13:37} And this my Son shall rebuke the wicked inventions of thosenations, which for their wicked life are fallen into the tempest;   

{13:38} And shall lay before them their evil thoughts, and thetorments wherewith they shall begin to be tormented, which are likeunto a flame: and he shall destroy them without labour by the law whichis like unto me.   

{13:39} And whereas thou sawest that he gathered another peaceablemultitude unto him;   

{13:40} Those are the ten tribes, which were carried away prisonersout of their own land in the time of Osea the king, whom Salmanasar theking of Assyria led away captive, and he carried them over the waters,and so came they into another land.   

{13:41} But they took this counsel among themselves, that they wouldleave the multitude of the heathen, and go forth into a furthercountry, where never mankind dwelt,   

{13:42} That they might there keep their statutes, which they neverkept in their own land.   

{13:43} And they entered into Euphrates by the narrow places of theriver.   

{13:44} For the most High then shewed signs for them, and held stillthe flood, till they were passed over.   

{13:45} For through that country there was a great way to go,namely, of a year and a half: and the same region is called Arsareth.   

{13:46} Then dwelt they there until the latter time; and now whenthey shall begin to come,   

{13:47} The Highest shall stay the springs of the stream again, thatthey may go through: therefore sawest thou the multitude with peace.   

{13:48} But those that be left behind of thy people are they thatare found within my borders.   

{13:49} Now when he destroyeth the multitude of the nations that aregathered together, he shall defend his people that remain.   

{13:50} And then shall he shew them great wonders.   

{13:51} Then said I, O Lord that bearest rule, shew me this:Wherefore have I seen the man coming up from the midst of the sea?   

{13:52} And he said unto me, Like as thou canst neither seek out norknow the things that are in the deep of the sea: even so can no manupon earth see my Son, or those that be with him, but in the day time.   

{13:53} This is the interpretation of the dream which thou sawest,and whereby thou only art here lightened.   

{13:54} For thou hast forsaken thine own way, and applied thydiligence unto my law, and sought it.   

{13:55} Thy life hast thou ordered in wisdom, and hast calledunderstanding thy mother.   

{13:56} And therefore have I shewed thee the treasures of theHighest: after other three days I will speak other things unto thee,and declare unto thee mighty and wondrous things.   

{13:57} Then went I forth into the field, giving praise and thanksgreatly unto the most High because of his wonders which he did in time;   

{13:58} And because he governeth the same, and such things as fallin their seasons: and there I sat three days.   

{14:1} And it came to pass upon the third day, I sat under an oak,and, behold, there came a voice out of a bush over against me, andsaid, Esdras, Esdras.   

{14:2} And I said, Here am I, Lord And I stood up upon my feet.   

{14:3} Then said he unto me, In the bush I did manifestly revealmyself unto Moses, and talked with him, when my people served in Egypt:   

{14:4} And I sent him and led my people out of Egypt, and broughthim up to the mount of where I held him by me a long season,   

{14:5} And told him many wondrous things, and shewed him the secretsof the times, and the end; and commanded him, saying,   

{14:6} These words shalt thou declare, and these shalt thou hide.   

{14:7} And now I say unto thee,   

{14:8} That thou lay up in thy heart the signs that I have shewed,and the dreams that thou hast seen, and the interpretations which thouhast heard:   

{14:9} For thou shalt be taken away from all, and from henceforththou shalt remain with my Son, and with such as be like thee, until thetimes be ended.   

{14:10} For the world hath lost his youth, and the times begin towax old.   

{14:11} For the world is divided into twelve parts, and the tenparts of it are gone already, and half of a tenth part:   

{14:12} And there remaineth that which is after the half of thetenth part.   

{14:13} Now therefore set thine house in order, and reprove thypeople, comfort such of them as be in trouble, and now renouncecorruption,   

{14:14} Let go from thee mortal thoughts, cast away the burdens ofman, put off now the weak nature,   

{14:15} And set aside the thoughts that are most heavy unto thee,and haste thee to flee from these times.   

{14:16} For yet greater evils than those which thou hast seen happenshall be done hereafter.   

{14:17} For look how much the world shall be weaker through age, somuch the more shall evils increase upon them that dwell therein.   

{14:18} For the time is fled far away, and leasing is hard at hand:for now hasteth the vision to come, which thou hast seen.   

{14:19} Then answered I before thee, and said,   

{14:20} Behold, Lord, I will go, as thou hast commanded me, andreprove the people which are present: but they that shall be bornafterward, who shall admonish them? thus the world is set in darkness,and they that dwell therein are without light.   

{14:21} For thy law is burnt, therefore no man knoweth the thingsthat are done of thee, or the work that shall begin.   

{14:22} But if I have found grace before thee, send the Holy Ghostinto me, and I shall write all that hath been done in the world sincethe beginning, which were written in thy law, that men may find thypath, and that they which will live in the latter days may live.   

{14:23} And he answered me, saying, Go thy way, gather the peopletogether, and say unto them, that they seek thee not for forty days.   

{14:24} But look thou prepare thee many box trees, and take withthee Sarea, Dabria, Selemia, Ecanus, and Asiel, these five which areready to write swiftly;   

{14:25} And come hither, and I shall light a candle of understandingin thine heart, which shall not be put out, till the things beperformed which thou shalt begin to write.   

{14:26} And when thou hast done, some things shalt thou publish, andsome things shalt thou shew secretly to the wise: to morrow this hourshalt thou begin to write.   

{14:27} Then went I forth, as he commanded, and gathered all thepeople together, and said,   

{14:28} Hear these words, O Israel.   

{14:29} Our fathers at the beginning were strangers in Egypt, fromwhence they were delivered:   

{14:30} And received the law of life, which they kept not, which yealso have transgressed after them.   

{14:31} Then was the land, even the land of Sion, parted among youby lot: but your fathers, and ye yourselves, have done unrighteousness,and have not kept the ways which the Highest commanded you.   

{14:32} And forasmuch as he is a righteous judge, he took from youin time the thing that he had given you.   

{14:33} And now are ye here, and your brethren among you.   

{14:34} Therefore if so be that ye will subdue your ownunderstanding, and reform your hearts, ye shall be kept alive and afterdeath ye shall obtain mercy.   

{14:35} For after death shall the judgment come, when we shall liveagain: and then shall the names of the righteous be manifest, and theworks of the ungodly shall be declared.   

{14:36} Let no man therefore come unto me now, nor seek after methese forty days.   

{14:37} So I took the five men, as he commanded me, and we went intothe field, and remained there.   

{14:38} And the next day, behold, a voice called me, saying, Esdras,open thy mouth, and drink that I give thee to drink.   

{14:39} Then opened I my mouth, and, behold, he reached me a fullcup, which was full as it were with water, but the colour of it waslike fire.   

{14:40} And I took it, and drank: and when I had drunk of it, myheart uttered understanding, and wisdom grew in my breast, for myspirit strengthened my memory:   

{14:41} And my mouth was opened, and shut no more.   

{14:42} The Highest gave understanding unto the five men, and theywrote the wonderful visions of the night that were told, which theyknew not: and they sat forty days, and they wrote in the day, and atnight they ate bread.   

{14:43} As for me. I spake in the day, and I held not my tongue bynight.   

{14:44} In forty days they wrote two hundred and four books.   

{14:45} And it came to pass, when the forty days were filled, thatthe Highest spake, saying, The first that thou hast written publishopenly, that the worthy and unworthy may read it:   

{14:46} But keep the seventy last, that thou mayest deliver themonly to such as be wise among the people:   

{14:47} For in them is the spring of understanding, the fountain ofwisdom, and the stream of knowledge.   

{14:48} And I did so.   

{15:1} Behold, speak thou in the ears of my people the words ofprophecy, which I will put in thy mouth, saith the Lord:   

{15:2} And cause them to be written in paper: for they are faithfuland true.   

{15:3} Fear not the imaginations against thee, let not theincredulity of them trouble thee, that speak against thee.   

{15:4} For all the unfaithful shall die in their unfaithfulness.   

{15:5} Behold, saith the Lord, I will bring plagues upon the world;the sword, famine, death, and destruction.   

{15:6} For wickedness hath exceedingly polluted the whole earth, andtheir hurtful works are fulfilled.   

{15:7} Therefore saith the Lord,   

{15:8} I will hold my tongue no more as touching their wickedness,which they profanely commit, neither will I suffer them in thosethings, in which they wickedly exercise themselves: behold, theinnocent and righteous blood crieth unto me, and the souls of the justcomplain continually.   

{15:9} And therefore, saith the Lord, I will surely avenge them, andreceive unto me all the innocent blood from among them.   

{15:10} Behold, my people is led as a flock to the slaughter: I willnot suffer them now to dwell in the land of Egypt:   

{15:11} But I will bring them with a mighty hand and a stretched outarm, and smite Egypt with plagues, as before, and will destroy all theland thereof.   

{15:12} Egypt shall mourn, and the foundation of it shall be smittenwith the plague and punishment that God shall bring upon it.   

{15:13} They that till the ground shall mourn: for their seeds shallfail through the blasting and hail, and with a fearful constellation.   

{15:14} Woe to the world and them that dwell therein!   

{15:15} For the sword and their destruction draweth nigh, and onepeople shall stand up and fight against another, and swords in theirhands.   

{15:16} For there shall be sedition among men, and invading oneanother; they shall not regard their kings nor princes, and the courseof their actions shall stand in their power.   

{15:17} A man shall desire to go into a city, and shall not be able.   

{15:18} For because of their pride the cities shall be troubled, thehouses shall be destroyed, and men shall be afraid.   

{15:19} A man shall have no pity upon his neighbour, but shalldestroy their houses with the sword, and spoil their goods, because ofthe lack of bread, and for great tribulation.   

{15:20} Behold, saith God, I will call together all the kings of theearth to reverence me, which are from the rising of the sun, from thesouth, from the east, and Libanus; to turn themselves one againstanother, and repay the things that they have done to them.   

{15:21} Like as they do yet this day unto my chosen, so will I doalso, and recompense in their bosom. Thus saith the Lord God;   

{15:22} My right hand shall not spare the sinners, and my swordshall not cease over them that shed innocent blood upon the earth.   

{15:23} The fire is gone forth from his wrath, and hath consumed thefoundations of the earth, and the sinners, like the straw that iskindled.   

{15:24} Woe to them that sin, and keep not my commandments! saiththe Lord.   

{15:25} I will not spare them: go your way, ye children, from thepower, defile not my sanctuary.   

{15:26} For the Lord knoweth all them that sin against him, andtherefore delivereth he them unto death and destruction.   

{15:27} For now are the plagues come upon the whole earth and yeshall remain in them: for God shall not deliver you, because ye havesinned against him.   

{15:28} Behold an horrible vision, and the appearance thereof fromthe east:   

{15:29} Where the nations of the dragons of Arabia shall come outwith many chariots, and the multitude of them shall be carried as thewind upon earth, that all they which hear them may fear and tremble.   

{15:30} Also the Carmanians raging in wrath shall go forth as thewild boars of the wood, and with great power shall they come, and joinbattle with them, and shall waste a portion of the land of theAssyrians.   

{15:31} And then shall the dragons have the upper hand, rememberingtheir nature; and if they shall turn themselves, conspiring together ingreat power to persecute them,   

{15:32} Then these shall be troubled bled, and keep silence throughtheir power, and shall flee.   

{15:33} And from the land of the Assyrians shall the enemy besiegethem, and consume some of them, and in their host shall be fear anddread, and strife among their kings.   

{15:34} Behold clouds from the east and from the north unto thesouth, and they are very horrible to look upon, full of wrath and storm.   

{15:35} They shall smite one upon another, and they shall smite downa great multitude of stars upon the earth, even their own star; andblood shall be from the sword unto the belly,   

{15:36} And dung of men unto the camel's hough.   

{15:37} And there shall be great fearfulness and trembling uponearth: and they that see the wrath shall be afraid, and trembling shallcome upon them.   

{15:38} And then shall there come great storms from the south, andfrom the north, and another part from the west.   

{15:39} And strong winds shall arise from the east, and shall openit; and the cloud which he raised up in wrath, and the star stirred tocause fear toward the east and west wind, shall be destroyed.   

{15:40} The great and mighty clouds shall be puffed up full ofwrath, and the star, that they may make all the earth afraid, and themthat dwell therein; and they shall pour out over every high and eminentplace an horrible star,   

{15:41} Fire, and hail, and flying swords, and many waters, that allfields may be full, and all rivers, with the abundance of great waters.   

{15:42} And they shall break down the cities and walls, mountainsand hills, trees of the wood, and grass of the meadows, and their corn.   

{15:43} And they shall go stedfastly unto Babylon, and make herafraid.   

{15:44} They shall come to her, and besiege her, the star and allwrath shall they pour out upon her: then shall the dust and smoke go upunto the heaven, and all they that be about her shall bewail her.   

{15:45} And they that remain under her shall do service unto themthat have put her in fear.   

{15:46} And thou, Asia, that art partaker of the hope of Babylon,and art the glory of her person:   

{15:47} Woe be unto thee, thou wretch, because thou hast madethyself like unto her; and hast decked thy daughters in whoredom, thatthey might please and glory in thy lovers, which have always desired tocommit whoredom with thee.   

{15:48} Thou hast followed her that is hated in all her works andinventions: therefore saith God,   

{15:49} I will send plagues upon thee; widowhood, poverty, famine,sword, and pestilence, to waste thy houses with destruction and death.   

{15:50} And the glory of thy Power shall be dried up as a flower,the heat shall arise that is sent over thee.   

{15:51} Thou shalt be weakened as a poor woman with stripes, and asone chastised with wounds, so that the mighty and lovers shall not beable to receive thee.   

{15:52} Would I with jealousy have so proceeded against thee, saiththe Lord,   

{15:53} If thou hadst not always slain my chosen, exalting thestroke of thine hands, and saying over their dead, when thou wastdrunken,   

{15:54} Set forth the beauty of thy countenance?   

{15:55} The reward of thy whoredom shall be in thy bosom, thereforeshalt thou receive recompence.   

{15:56} Like as thou hast done unto my chosen, saith the Lord, evenso shall God do unto thee, and shall deliver thee into mischief   

{15:57} Thy children shall die of hunger, and thou shalt fallthrough the sword: thy cities shall be broken down, and all thine shallperish with the sword in the field.   

{15:58} They that be in the mountains shall die of hunger, and eattheir own flesh, and drink their own blood, for very hunger of bread,and thirst of water.   

{15:59} Thou as unhappy shalt come through the sea, and receiveplagues again.   

{15:60} And in the passage they shall rush on the idle city, andshall destroy some portion of thy land, and consume part of thy glory,and shall return to Babylon that was destroyed.   

{15:61} And thou shalt be cast down by them as stubble, and theyshall be unto thee as fire;   

{15:62} And shall consume thee, and thy cities, thy land, and thymountains; all thy woods and thy fruitful trees shall they burn up withfire.   

{15:63} Thy children shall they carry away captive, and, look, whatthou hast, they shall spoil it, and mar the beauty of thy face.   

{16:1} Woe be unto thee, Babylon, and Asia! woe be unto thee, Egyptand Syria!   

{16:2} Gird up yourselves with cloths of sack and hair, bewail yourchildren, and be sorry; for your destruction is at hand.   

{16:3} A sword is sent upon you, and who may turn it back?   

{16:4} A fire is sent among you, and who may quench it?   

{16:5} Plagues are sent unto you, and what is he that may drive themaway?   

{16:6} May any man drive away an hungry lion in the wood? or may anyone quench the fire in stubble, when it hath begun to burn?   

{16:7} May one turn again the arrow that is shot of a strong archer?   

{16:8} The mighty Lord sendeth the plagues and who is he that candrive them away?   

{16:9} A fire shall go forth from his wrath, and who is he that mayquench it?   

{16:10} He shall cast lightnings, and who shall not fear? he shallthunder, and who shall not be afraid?   

{16:11} The Lord shall threaten, and who shall not be utterly beatento powder at his presence?   

{16:12} The earth quaketh, and the foundations thereof; the seaariseth up with waves from the deep, and the waves of it are troubled,and the fishes thereof also, before the Lord, and before the glory ofhis power:   

{16:13} For strong is his right hand that bendeth the bow, hisarrows that he shooteth are sharp, and shall not miss, when they beginto be shot into the ends of the world.   

{16:14} Behold, the plagues are sent, and shall not return again,until they come upon the earth.   

{16:15} The fire is kindled, and shall not be put out, till itconsume the foundation of the earth.   

{16:16} Like as an arrow which is shot of a mighty archer returnethnot backward: even so the plagues that shall be sent upon earth shallnot return again.   

{16:17} Woe is me! woe is me! who will deliver me in those days?   

{16:18} The beginning of sorrows and great mournings; the beginningof famine and great death; the beginning of wars, and the powers shallstand in fear; the beginning of evils! what shall I do when these evilsshall come?   

{16:19} Behold, famine and plague, tribulation and anguish, are sentas scourges for amendment.   

{16:20} But for all these things they shall not turn from theirwickedness, nor be always mindful of the scourges.   

{16:21} Behold, victuals shall be so good cheap upon earth, thatthey shall think themselves to be in good case, and even then shallevils grow upon earth, sword, famine, and great confusion.   

{16:22} For many of them that dwell upon earth shall perish offamine; and the other, that escape the hunger, shall the sword destroy.   

{16:23} And the dead shall be cast out as dung, and there shall beno man to comfort them: for the earth shall be wasted, and the citiesshall be cast down.   

{16:24} There shall be no man left to till the earth, and to sow it   

{16:25} The trees shall give fruit, and who shall gather them?   

{16:26} The grapes shall ripen, and who shall tread them? for allplaces shall be desolate of men:   

{16:27} So that one man shall desire to see another, and to hear hisvoice.   

{16:28} For of a city there shall be ten left, and two of the field,which shall hide themselves in the thick groves, and in the clefts ofthe rocks.   

{16:29} As in an orchard of Olives upon every tree there are leftthree or four olives;   

{16:30} Or as when a vineyard is gathered, there are left someclusters of them that diligently seek through the vineyard:   

{16:31} Even so in those days there shall be three or four left bythem that search their houses with the sword.   

{16:32} And the earth shall be laid waste, and the fields thereofshall wax old, and her ways and all her paths shall grow full ofthorns, because no man shall travel therethrough.   

{16:33} The virgins shall mourn, having no bridegrooms; the womenshall mourn, having no husbands; their daughters shall mourn, having nohelpers.   

{16:34} In the wars shall their bridegrooms be destroyed, and theirhusbands shall perish of famine.   

{16:35} Hear now these things and understand them, ye servants ofthe Lord.   

{16:36} Behold, the word of the Lord, receive it: believe not thegods of whom the Lord spake.   

{16:37} Behold, the plagues draw nigh, and are not slack.   

{16:38} As when a woman with child in the ninth month bringeth forthher son, with two or three hours of her birth great pains compass herwomb, which pains, when the child cometh forth, they slack not a moment:   

{16:39} Even so shall not the plagues be slack to come upon theearth, and the world shall mourn, and sorrows shall come upon it onevery side.   

{16:40} O my people, hear my word: make you ready to thy battle, andin those evils be even as pilgrims upon the earth.   

{16:41} He that selleth, let him be as he that fleeth away: and hethat buyeth, as one that will lose:   

{16:42} He that occupieth merchandise, as he that hath no profit byit: and he that buildeth, as he that shall not dwell therein:   

{16:43} He that soweth, as if he should not reap: so also he thatplanteth the vineyard, as he that shall not gather the grapes:   

{16:44} They that marry, as they that shall get no children; andthey that marry not, as the widowers.   

{16:45} And therefore they that labour labour in vain:   

{16:46} For strangers shall reap their fruits, and spoil theirgoods, overthrow their houses, and take their children captives, for incaptivity and famine shall they get children.   

{16:47} And they that occupy their merchandise with robbery, themore they deck their cities, their houses, their possessions, and theirown persons:   

{16:48} The more will I be angry with them for their sin, saith theLord.   

{16:49} Like as a whore envieth a right honest and virtuous woman:   

{16:50} So shall righteousness hate iniquity, when she deckethherself, and shall accuse her to her face, when he cometh that shalldefend him that diligently searcheth out every sin upon earth.   

{16:51} And therefore be ye not like thereunto, nor to the worksthereof.   

{16:52} For yet a little, and iniquity shall be taken away out ofthe earth, and righteousness shall reign among you.   

{16:53} Let not the sinner say that he hath not sinned: for Godshall burn coals of fire upon his head, which saith before the Lord Godand his glory, I have not sinned.   

{16:54} Behold, the Lord knoweth all the works of men, theirimaginations, their thoughts, and their hearts:   

{16:55} Which spake but the word, Let the earth be made; and it wasmade: Let the heaven be made; and it was created.   

{16:56} In his word were the stars made, and he knoweth the numberof them.   

{16:57} He searcheth the deep, and the treasures thereof; he hathmeasured the sea, and what it containeth.   

{16:58} He hath shut the sea in the midst of the waters, and withhis word hath he hanged the earth upon the waters.   

{16:59} He spreadeth out the heavens like a vault; upon the watershath he founded it.   

{16:60} In the desert hath he made springs of water, and pools uponthe tops of the mountains, that the floods might pour down from thehigh rocks to water the earth.   

{16:61} He made man, and put his heart in the midst of the body, andgave him breath, life, and understanding.   

{16:62} Yea and the Spirit of Almighty God, which made all things,and searcheth out all hidden things in the secrets of the earth,   

{16:63} Surely he knoweth your inventions, and what ye think in yourhearts, even them that sin, and would hide their sin.   

{16:64} Therefore hath the Lord exactly searched out all your works,and he will put you all to shame.   

{16:65} And when your sins are brought forth, ye shall be ashamedbefore men, and your own sins shall be your accusers in that day.   

{16:66} What will ye do? or how will ye hide your sins before Godand his angels?   

{16:67} Behold, God himself is the judge, fear him: leave off fromyour sins, and forget your iniquities, to meddle no more with them forever: so shall God lead you forth, and deliver you from all trouble.   

{16:68} For, behold, the burning wrath of a great multitude iskindled over you, and they shall take away certain of you, and feedyou, being idle, with things offered unto idols.   

{16:69} And they that consent unto them shall be had in derision andin reproach, and trodden under foot.   

{16:70} For there shall be in every place, and in the next cities, agreat insurrection upon those that fear the Lord.   

{16:71} They shall be like mad men, sparing none, but still spoilingand destroying those that fear the Lord.   

{16:72} For they shall waste and take away their goods, and castthem out of their houses.   

{16:73} Then shall they be known, who are my chosen; and they shallbe tried as the gold in the fire.   

{16:74} Hear, O ye my beloved, saith the Lord: behold, the days oftrouble are at hand, but I will deliver you from the same.   

{16:75} Be ye not afraid neither doubt; for God is your guide,   

{16:76} And the guide of them who keep my commandments and precepts,saith the Lord God: let not your sins weigh you down, and let not youriniquities lift up themselves.   

{16:77} Woe be unto them that are bound with their sins, and coveredwith their iniquities like as a field is covered over with bushes, andthe path thereof covered with thorns, that no man may travel through!   

{16:78} It is left undressed, and is cast into the fire to beconsumed therewith.The Prayer of Manasseh, or, The Prayer of Manasses King of Judah   

{1:1} O Lord, Almighty God of our fathers, Abraham, Isaac, andJacob, and of their righteous seed; 

{1:2} who hast made heaven andearth, with all the ornament thereof; 

{1:3} who hast bound the sea bythe word of thy commandment; who hast shut up the deep, and sealed itby thy terrible and glorious name; 

{1:4} whom all men fear, and tremblebefore thy power; for the majesty of thy glory cannot be borne, andthine angry threatening toward sinners is importable: 

{1:5} but thymerciful promise is unmeasurable and unsearchable; 

{1:6} for thou artthe most high Lord, of great compassion, longsuffering, very merciful,and repentest of the evils of men. Thou, O Lord, according to thy greatgoodness hast promised repentance and forgiveness to them that havesinned against thee: and of thine infinite mercies hast appointedrepentance unto sinners, that they may be saved. 

{1:7} Thou therefore,O Lord, that art the God of the just, hast not appointed repentance tothe just, as to Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, which have not sinnedagainst thee; but thou hast appointed repentance unto me that am asinner: 

{1:8} for I have sinned above the number of the sands of thesea. My transgressions, O Lord, are multiplied: my transgressions aremultiplied, and I am not worthy to behold and see the height of heavenfor the multitude of mine iniquities. 

{1:9} I am bowed down with manyiron bands, that I cannot lift up mine head, neither have any release:for I have provoked thy wrath, and done evil before thee: I did not thywill, neither kept I thy commandments: I have set up abominations, andhave multiplied offences. 

{1:10} Now therefore I bow the knee of mineheart, beseeching thee of grace. 

{1:11} I have sinned, O Lord, I havesinned, and I acknowledge mine iniquities: 

{1:12} wherefore, I humblybeseech thee, forgive me, O Lord, forgive me, and destroy me not withmine iniquites. Be not angry with me for ever, by reserving evil forme; neither condemn me to the lower parts of the earth. For thou artthe God, even the God of them that repent; 

{1:13} and in me thou wiltshew all thy goodness: for thou wilt save me, that am unworthy,according to thy great mercy. 

{1:14} Therefore I will praise thee forever all the days of my life: for all the powers of the heavens dopraise thee, and thine is the glory for ever and ever. Amen.
