{The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy   

{1:1} Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, accordingto the promise of life which is in Christ Jesus, 

{1:2} To Timothy, [my]dearly beloved son: Grace, mercy, [and] peace, from God the Father andChrist Jesus our Lord. 

{1:3} I thank God, whom I serve from [my]forefathers with pure conscience, that without ceasing I haveremembrance of thee in my prayers night and day; 

{1:4} Greatly desiringto see thee, being mindful of thy tears, that I may be filled with joy;

{1:5} When I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in thee,which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois, and thy mother Eunice; and Iam persuaded that in thee also. 

{1:6} Wherefore I put thee inremembrance that thou stir up the gift of God, which is in thee by theputting on of my hands. 

{1:7} For God hath not given us the spirit offear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind. 

{1:8} Be not thoutherefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner:but be thou partaker of the afflictions of the gospel according to thepower of God; 

{1:9} Who hath saved us, and called [us] with an holycalling, not according to our works, but according to his own purposeand grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began,

{1:10} But is now made manifest by the appearing of our Saviour JesusChrist, who hath abolished death, and hath brought life and immortalityto light through the gospel: 

{1:11} Whereunto I am appointed apreacher, and an apostle, and a teacher of the Gentiles. 

{1:12} For thewhich cause I also suffer these things: nevertheless I am not ashamed:for I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is able tokeep that which I have committed unto him against that day. 

{1:13} Holdfast the form of sound words, which thou hast heard of me, in faith andlove which is in Christ Jesus. 

{1:14} That good thing which wascommitted unto thee keep by the Holy Ghost which dwelleth in us. 

{1:15}This thou knowest, that all they which are in Asia be turned away fromme; of whom are Phygellus and Hermogenes. 

{1:16} The Lord give mercyunto the house of Onesiphorus; for he oft refreshed me, and was notashamed of my chain: 

{1:17} But, when he was in Rome, he sought me outvery diligently, and found [me. ]

{1:18} The Lord grant unto him that hemay find mercy of the Lord in that day: and in how many things heministered unto me at Ephesus, thou knowest very well.   

{2:1} Thou therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is inChrist Jesus. 

{2:2} And the things that thou hast heard of me amongmany witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be ableto teach others also. 

{2:3} Thou therefore endure hardness, as a goodsoldier of Jesus Christ. 

{2:4} No man that warreth entangleth himselfwith the affairs of [this] life; that he may please him who hath chosenhim to be a soldier. 

{2:5} And if a man also strive for masteries,[yet] is he not crowned, except he strive lawfully. 

{2:6} Thehusbandman that laboureth must be first partaker of the fruits. 

{2:7}Consider what I say; and the Lord give thee understanding in allthings. 

{2:8} Remember that Jesus Christ of the seed of David wasraised from the dead according to my gospel: 

{2:9} Wherein I suffertrouble, as an evil doer, [even] unto bonds; but the word of God is notbound. 

{2:10} Therefore I endure all things for the elect's sakes, thatthey may also obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus witheternal glory. 

{2:11} [It is] a faithful saying: For if we be dead with[him,] we shall also live with [him: ]

{2:12} If we suffer, we shallalso reign with [him:] if we deny [him,] he also will deny us: 

{2:13}If we believe not, [yet] he abideth faithful: he cannot deny himself.

{2:14} Of these things put [them] in remembrance, charging [them]before the Lord that they strive not about words to no profit, [but] tothe subverting of the hearers. 

{2:15} Study to shew thyself approvedunto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividingthe word of truth. 

{2:16} But shun profane [and] vain babblings: forthey will increase unto more ungodliness. 

{2:17} And their word willeat as doth a canker: of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus; 

{2:18} Whoconcerning the truth have erred, saying that the resurrection is pastalready; and overthrow the faith of some. 

{2:19} Nevertheless thefoundation of God standeth sure, having this seal, The Lord knoweththem that are his. And, Let every one that nameth the name of Christdepart from iniquity. 

{2:20} But in a great house there are not onlyvessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth; and someto honour, and some to dishonour. 

{2:21} If a man therefore purgehimself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honour, sanctified, andmeet for the master's use, [and] prepared unto every good work. 

{2:22}Flee also youthful lusts: but follow righteousness, faith, charity,peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart. 

{2:23} Butfoolish and unlearned questions avoid, knowing that they do genderstrifes. 

{2:24} And the servant of the Lord must not strive; but begentle unto all [men,] apt to teach, patient, 

{2:25} In meeknessinstructing those that oppose themselves; if God peradventure will givethem repentance to the acknowledging of the truth; 

{2:26} And [that]they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil, who aretaken captive by him at his will.   

{3:1} This know also, that in the last days perilous times shallcome. 

{3:2} For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous,boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful,unholy, 

{3:3} Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers,incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good, 

{3:4} Traitors,heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God; 

{3:5}Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from suchturn away. 

{3:6} For of this sort are they which creep into houses, andlead captive silly women laden with sins, led away with divers lusts,

{3:7} Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of thetruth. 

{3:8} Now as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do thesealso resist the truth: men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning thefaith. 

{3:9} But they shall proceed no further: for their folly shallbe manifest unto all [men,] as theirs also was. 

{3:10} But thou hastfully known my doctrine, manner of life, purpose, faith, longsuffering,charity, patience, 

{3:11} Persecutions, afflictions, which came unto meat Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra; what persecutions I endured: but outof [them] all the Lord delivered me. 

{3:12} Yea, and all that will livegodly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution. 

{3:13} But evil men andseducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving, and being deceived.

{3:14} But continue thou in the things which thou hast learned and hastbeen assured of, knowing of whom thou hast learned [them; ]

{3:15} Andthat from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are ableto make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in ChristJesus. 

{3:16} All scripture [is] given by inspiration of God, and [is]profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instructionin righteousness: 

{3:17} That the man of God may be perfect, throughlyfurnished unto all good works.   

{4:1} I charge [thee] therefore before God, and the Lord JesusChrist, who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and hiskingdom; 

{4:2} Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season;reprove, rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine. 

{4:3} Forthe time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but aftertheir own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itchingears; 

{4:4} And they shall turn away [their] ears from the truth, andshall be turned unto fables. 

{4:5} But watch thou in all things, endureafflictions, do the work of an evangelist, make full proof of thyministry. 

{4:6} For I am now ready to be offered, and the time of mydeparture is at hand. 

{4:7} I have fought a good fight, I have finished[my] course, I have kept the faith: 

{4:8} Henceforth there is laid upfor me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge,shall give me at that day: and not to me only, but unto all them alsothat love his appearing.   

{4:9} Do thy diligence to come shortly unto me: 

{4:10} For Demashath forsaken me, having loved this present world, and is departed untoThessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, Titus unto Dalmatia. 

{4:11} OnlyLuke is with me. Take Mark, and bring him with thee: for he isprofitable to me for the ministry. 

{4:12} And Tychicus have I sent toEphesus. 

{4:13} The cloke that I left at Troas with Carpus, when thoucomest, bring [with thee,] and the books, [but] especially theparchments. 

{4:14} Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil: the Lordreward him according to his works: 

{4:15} Of whom be thou ware also;for he hath greatly withstood our words. 

{4:16} At my first answer noman stood with me, but all [men] forsook me: [I pray God] that it maynot be laid to their charge. 

{4:17} Notwithstanding the Lord stood withme, and strengthened me; that by me the preaching might be fully known,and [that] all the Gentiles might hear: and I was delivered out of themouth of the lion. 

{4:18} And the Lord shall deliver me from every evilwork, and will preserve [me] unto his heavenly kingdom: to whom [be]glory for ever and ever. Amen.   

{4:19} Salute Prisca and Aquila, and the household of Onesiphorus.

{4:20} Erastus abode at Corinth: but Trophimus have I left at Miletumsick. 

{4:21} Do thy diligence to come before winter. Eubulus greeteththee, and Pudens, and Linus, and Claudia, and all the brethren.   

{4:22} The Lord Jesus Christ [be] with thy spirit. Grace [be] withyou. Amen.
