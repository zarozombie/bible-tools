{Joel   

{1:1} The word of the LORD that came to Joel the son of Pethuel.

{1:2} Hear this, ye old men, and give ear, all ye inhabitants of theland. Hath this been in your days, or even in the days of your fathers?

{1:3} Tell ye your children of it, and [let] your children [tell] theirchildren, and their children another generation. 

{1:4} That which thepalmerworm hath left hath the locust eaten; and that which the locusthath left hath the cankerworm eaten; and that which the cankerworm hathleft hath the caterpiller eaten. 

{1:5} Awake, ye drunkards, and weep;and howl, all ye drinkers of wine, because of the new wine; for it iscut off from your mouth. 

{1:6} For a nation is come up upon my land,strong, and without number, whose teeth [are] the teeth of a lion, andhe hath the cheek teeth of a great lion. 

{1:7} He hath laid my vinewaste, and barked my fig tree: he hath made it clean bare, and cast[it] away; the branches thereof are made white.   

{1:8} Lament like a virgin girded with sackcloth for the husband ofher youth. 

{1:9} The meat offering and the drink offering is cut offfrom the house of the LORD; the priests, the LORD'S ministers, mourn.

{1:10} The field is wasted, the land mourneth; for the corn is wasted:the new wine is dried up, the oil languisheth. 

{1:11} Be ye ashamed, Oye husbandmen; howl, O ye vinedressers, for the wheat and for thebarley; because the harvest of the field is perished. 

{1:12} The vineis dried up, and the fig tree languisheth; the pomegranate tree, thepalm tree also, and the apple tree, [even] all the trees of the field,are withered: because joy is withered away from the sons of men. 

{1:13}Gird yourselves, and lament, ye priests: howl, ye ministers of thealtar: come, lie all night in sackcloth, ye ministers of my God: forthe meat offering and the drink offering is withholden from the houseof your God.   

{1:14} Sanctify ye a fast, call a solemn assembly, gather the elders[and] all the inhabitants of the land [into] the house of the LORD yourGod, and cry unto the LORD, 

{1:15} Alas for the day! for the day of theLORD [is] at hand, and as a destruction from the Almighty shall itcome. 

{1:16} Is not the meat cut off before our eyes, [yea,] joy andgladness from the house of our God? 

{1:17} The seed is rotten undertheir clods, the garners are laid desolate, the barns are broken down;for the corn is withered. 

{1:18} How do the beasts groan! the herds ofcattle are perplexed, because they have no pasture; yea, the flocks ofsheep are made desolate. 

{1:19} O LORD, to thee will I cry: for thefire hath devoured the pastures of the wilderness, and the flame hathburned all the trees of the field. 

{1:20} The beasts of the field cryalso unto thee: for the rivers of waters are dried up, and the firehath devoured the pastures of the wilderness.   

{2:1} Blow ye the trumpet in Zion, and sound an alarm in my holymountain: let all the inhabitants of the land tremble: for the day ofthe LORD cometh, for [it is] nigh at hand; 

{2:2} A day of darkness andof gloominess, a day of clouds and of thick darkness, as the morningspread upon the mountains: a great people and a strong; there hath notbeen ever the like, neither shall be any more after it, [even] to theyears of many generations. 

{2:3} A fire devoureth before them; andbehind them a flame burneth: the land [is] as the garden of Eden beforethem, and behind them a desolate wilderness; yea, and nothing shallescape them. 

{2:4} The appearance of them [is] as the appearance ofhorses; and as horsemen, so shall they run. 

{2:5} Like the noise ofchariots on the tops of mountains shall they leap, like the noise of aflame of fire that devoureth the stubble, as a strong people set inbattle array. 

{2:6} Before their face the people shall be much pained:all faces shall gather blackness. 

{2:7} They shall run like mighty men;they shall climb the wall like men of war; and they shall march everyone on his ways, and they shall not break their ranks: 

{2:8} Neithershall one thrust another; they shall walk every one in his path: and[when] they fall upon the sword, they shall not be wounded. 

{2:9} Theyshall run to and fro in the city; they shall run upon the wall, theyshall climb up upon the houses; they shall enter in at the windows likea thief. 

{2:10} The earth shall quake before them; the heavens shalltremble: the sun and the moon shall be dark, and the stars shallwithdraw their shining: 

{2:11} And the LORD shall utter his voicebefore his army: for his camp [is] very great: for [he is] strong thatexecuteth his word: for the day of the LORD [is] great and veryterrible; and who can abide it? 

{2:12} Therefore also now, saith theLORD, turn ye [even] to me with all your heart, and with fasting, andwith weeping, and with mourning: 

{2:13} And rend your heart, and notyour garments, and turn unto the LORD your God: for he [is] graciousand merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and repenteth himof the evil. 

{2:14} Who knoweth [if] he will return and repent, andleave a blessing behind him; [even] a meat offering and a drinkoffering unto the LORD your God?   

{2:15} Blow the trumpet in Zion, sanctify a fast, call a solemnassembly: 

{2:16} Gather the people, sanctify the congregation, assemblethe elders, gather the children, and those that suck the breasts: letthe bridegroom go forth of his chamber, and the bride out of hercloset. 

{2:17} Let the priests, the ministers of the LORD, weep betweenthe porch and the altar, and let them say, Spare thy people, O LORD,and give not thine heritage to reproach, that the heathen should ruleover them: wherefore should they say among the people, Where [is] theirGod?   

{2:18} Then will the LORD be jealous for his land, and pity hispeople. 

{2:19} Yea, the LORD will answer and say unto his people,Behold, I will send you corn, and wine, and oil, and ye shall besatisfied therewith: and I will no more make you a reproach among theheathen: 

{2:20} But I will remove far off from you the northern [army,]and will drive him into a land barren and desolate, with his facetoward the east sea, and his hinder part toward the utmost sea, and hisstink shall come up, and his ill savour shall come up, because he hathdone great things.   

{2:21} Fear not, O land; be glad and rejoice: for the LORD will dogreat things. 

{2:22} Be not afraid, ye beasts of the field: for thepastures of the wilderness do spring, for the tree beareth her fruit,the fig tree and the vine do yield their strength. 

{2:23} Be glad then,ye children of Zion, and rejoice in the LORD your God: for he hathgiven you the former rain moderately, and he will cause to come downfor you the rain, the former rain, and the latter rain in the first[month. ]

{2:24} And the floors shall be full of wheat, and the fatsshall overflow with wine and oil. 

{2:25} And I will restore to you theyears that the locust hath eaten, the cankerworm, and the caterpiller,and the palmerworm, my great army which I sent among you. 

{2:26} And yeshall eat in plenty, and be satisfied, and praise the name of the LORDyour God, that hath dealt wondrously with you: and my people shallnever be ashamed. 

{2:27} And ye shall know that I [am] in the midst ofIsrael, and [that] I [am] the LORD your God, and none else: and mypeople shall never be ashamed.   

{2:28} And it shall come to pass afterward, [that] I will pour outmy spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shallprophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall seevisions: 

{2:29} And also upon the servants and upon the handmaids inthose days will I pour out my spirit. 

{2:30} And I will shew wonders inthe heavens and in the earth, blood, and fire, and pillars of smoke.

{2:31} The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood,before the great and the terrible day of the LORD come. 

{2:32} And itshall come to pass, [that] whosoever shall call on the name of the LORDshall be delivered: for in mount Zion and in Jerusalem shall bedeliverance, as the LORD hath said, and in the remnant whom the LORDshall call.   

{3:1} For, behold, in those days, and in that time, when I shallbring again the captivity of Judah and Jerusalem, 

{3:2} I will alsogather all nations, and will bring them down into the valley ofJehoshaphat, and will plead with them there for my people and [for] myheritage Israel, whom they have scattered among the nations, and partedmy land. 

{3:3} And they have cast lots for my people; and have given aboy for an harlot, and sold a girl for wine, that they might drink.

{3:4} Yea, and what have ye to do with me, O Tyre, and Zidon, and allthe coasts of Palestine? will ye render me a recompence? and if yerecompense me, swiftly [and] speedily will I return your recompenceupon your own head; 

{3:5} Because ye have taken my silver and my gold,and have carried into your temples my goodly pleasant things: 

{3:6} Thechildren also of Judah and the children of Jerusalem have ye sold untothe Grecians, that ye might remove them far from their border. 

{3:7}Behold, I will raise them out of the place whither ye have sold them,and will return your recompence upon your own head: 

{3:8} And I willsell your sons and your daughters into the hand of the children ofJudah, and they shall sell them to the Sabeans, to a people far off:for the LORD hath spoken [it.]   

{3:9} Proclaim ye this among the Gentiles; Prepare war, wake up themighty men, let all the men of war draw near; let them come up: 

{3:10}Beat your plowshares into swords, and your pruninghooks into spears:let the weak say, I [am] strong. 

{3:11} Assemble yourselves, and come,all ye heathen, and gather yourselves together round about: thithercause thy mighty ones to come down, O LORD. 

{3:12} Let the heathen bewakened, and come up to the valley of Jehoshaphat: for there will I sitto judge all the heathen round about. 

{3:13} Put ye in the sickle, forthe harvest is ripe: come, get you down; for the press is full, thefats overflow; for their wickedness [is] great. 

{3:14} Multitudes,multitudes in the valley of decision: for the day of the LORD [is] nearin the valley of decision. 

{3:15} The sun and the moon shall bedarkened, and the stars shall withdraw their shining. 

{3:16} The LORDalso shall roar out of Zion, and utter his voice from Jerusalem; andthe heavens and the earth shall shake: but the LORD [will be] the hopeof his people, and the strength of the children of Israel. 

{3:17} Soshall ye know that I [am] the LORD your God dwelling in Zion, my holymountain: then shall Jerusalem be holy, and there shall no strangerspass through her any more.   

{3:18} And it shall come to pass in that day, [that] the mountainsshall drop down new wine, and the hills shall flow with milk, and allthe rivers of Judah shall flow with waters, and a fountain shall comeforth of the house of the LORD, and shall water the valley of Shittim.

{3:19} Egypt shall be a desolation, and Edom shall be a desolatewilderness, for the violence [against] the children of Judah, becausethey have shed innocent blood in their land. 

{3:20} But Judah shalldwell for ever, and Jerusalem from generation to generation. 

{3:21} ForI will cleanse their blood [that] I have not cleansed: for the LORDdwelleth in Zion.
