{The Proverbs   

{1:1} The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel;

{1:2} To know wisdom and instruction; to perceive the words ofunderstanding; 

{1:3} To receive the instruction of wisdom, justice, andjudgment, and equity; 

{1:4} To give subtilty to the simple, to theyoung man knowledge and discretion. 

{1:5} A wise [man] will hear, andwill increase learning; and a man of understanding shall attain untowise counsels: 

{1:6} To understand a proverb, and the interpretation;the words of the wise, and their dark sayings.   

{1:7} The fear of the LORD [is] the beginning of knowledge: [but]fools despise wisdom and instruction. 

{1:8} My son, hear theinstruction of thy father, and forsake not the law of thy mother: 

{1:9}For they [shall be] an ornament of grace unto thy head, and chainsabout thy neck.   

{1:10} My son, if sinners entice thee, consent thou not. 

{1:11} Ifthey say, Come with us, let us lay wait for blood, let us lurk privilyfor the innocent without cause: 

{1:12} Let us swallow them up alive asthe grave; and whole, as those that go down into the pit: 

{1:13} Weshall find all precious substance, we shall fill our houses with spoil:

{1:14} Cast in thy lot among us; let us all have one purse: 

{1:15} Myson, walk not thou in the way with them; refrain thy foot from theirpath: 

{1:16} For their feet run to evil, and make haste to shed blood.

{1:17} Surely in vain the net is spread in the sight of any bird.

{1:18} And they lay wait for their [own] blood; they lurk privily fortheir [own] lives. 

{1:19} So [are] the ways of every one that is greedyof gain; [which] taketh away the life of the owners thereof.   

{1:20} Wisdom crieth without; she uttereth her voice in the streets:

{1:21} She crieth in the chief place of concourse, in the openings ofthe gates: in the city she uttereth her words, [saying, ]

{1:22} Howlong, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity? and the scorners delightin their scorning, and fools hate knowledge? 

{1:23} Turn you at myreproof: behold, I will pour out my spirit unto you, I will make knownmy words unto you.   

{1:24} Because I have called, and ye refused; I have stretched outmy hand, and no man regarded; 

{1:25} But ye have set at nought all mycounsel, and would none of my reproof: 

{1:26} I also will laugh at yourcalamity; I will mock when your fear cometh; 

{1:27} When your fearcometh as desolation, and your destruction cometh as a whirlwind; whendistress and anguish cometh upon you. 

{1:28} Then shall they call uponme, but I will not answer; they shall seek me early, but they shall notfind me: 

{1:29} For that they hated knowledge, and did not choose thefear of the LORD: 

{1:30} They would none of my counsel: they despisedall my reproof. 

{1:31} Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of theirown way, and be filled with their own devices. 

{1:32} For the turningaway of the simple shall slay them, and the prosperity of fools shalldestroy them. 

{1:33} But whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell safely,and shall be quiet from fear of evil.   

{2:1} My son, if thou wilt receive my words, and hide mycommandments with thee; 

{2:2} So that thou incline thine ear untowisdom, [and] apply thine heart to understanding; 

{2:3} Yea, if thoucriest after knowledge, [and] liftest up thy voice for understanding;

{2:4} If thou seekest her as silver, and searchest for her as [for] hidtreasures; 

{2:5} Then shalt thou understand the fear of the LORD, andfind the knowledge of God. 

{2:6} For the LORD giveth wisdom: out of hismouth [cometh] knowledge and understanding. 

{2:7} He layeth up soundwisdom for the righteous: [he is] a buckler to them that walkuprightly. 

{2:8} He keepeth the paths of judgment, and preserveth theway of his saints. 

{2:9} Then shalt thou understand righteousness, andjudgment, and equity; [yea,] every good path.   

{2:10} When wisdom entereth into thine heart, and knowledge ispleasant unto thy soul; 

{2:11} Discretion shall preserve thee,understanding shall keep thee: 

{2:12} To deliver thee from the way ofthe evil [man,] from the man that speaketh froward things; 

{2:13} Wholeave the paths of uprightness, to walk in the ways of darkness; 

{2:14}Who rejoice to do evil, [and] delight in the frowardness of the wicked;

{2:15} Whose ways [are] crooked, and [they] froward in their paths:

{2:16} To deliver thee from the strange woman, [even] from the stranger[which] flattereth with her words; 

{2:17} Which forsaketh the guide ofher youth, and forgetteth the covenant of her God. 

{2:18} For her houseinclineth unto death, and her paths unto the dead. 

{2:19} None that gounto her return again, neither take they hold of the paths of life.

{2:20} That thou mayest walk in the way of good [men,] and keep thepaths of the righteous. 

{2:21} For the upright shall dwell in the land,and the perfect shall remain in it. 

{2:22} But the wicked shall be cutoff from the earth, and the transgressors shall be rooted out of it.   

{3:1} My son, forget not my law; but let thine heart keep mycommandments: 

{3:2} For length of days, and long life, and peace, shallthey add to thee. 

{3:3} Let not mercy and truth forsake thee: bind themabout thy neck; write them upon the table of thine heart: 

{3:4} Soshalt thou find favour and good understanding in the sight of God andman.   

{3:5} Trust in the LORD with all thine heart; and lean not untothine own understanding. 

{3:6} In all thy ways acknowledge him, and heshall direct thy paths.   

{3:7} Be not wise in thine own eyes: fear the LORD, and depart fromevil. 

{3:8} It shall be health to thy navel, and marrow to thy bones.

{3:9} Honour the LORD with thy substance, and with the firstfruits ofall thine increase: 

{3:10} So shall thy barns be filled with plenty,and thy presses shall burst out with new wine.   

{3:11} My son, despise not the chastening of the LORD; neither beweary of his correction: 

{3:12} For whom the LORD loveth he correcteth;even as a father the son [in whom] he delighteth.   

{3:13} Happy [is] the man [that] findeth wisdom, and the man [that]getteth understanding. 

{3:14} For the merchandise of it [is] betterthan the merchandise of silver, and the gain thereof than fine gold.

{3:15} She [is] more precious than rubies: and all the things thoucanst desire are not to be compared unto her. 

{3:16} Length of days[is] in her right hand; [and] in her left hand riches and honour.

{3:17} Her ways [are] ways of pleasantness, and all her paths [are]peace. 

{3:18} She [is] a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her:and happy [is every one] that retaineth her. 

{3:19} The LORD by wisdomhath founded the earth; by understanding hath he established theheavens. 

{3:20} By his knowledge the depths are broken up, and theclouds drop down the dew.   

{3:21} My son, let not them depart from thine eyes: keep soundwisdom and discretion: 

{3:22} So shall they be life unto thy soul, andgrace to thy neck. 

{3:23} Then shalt thou walk in thy way safely, andthy foot shall not stumble. 

{3:24} When thou liest down, thou shalt notbe afraid: yea, thou shalt lie down, and thy sleep shall be sweet.

{3:25} Be not afraid of sudden fear, neither of the desolation of thewicked, when it cometh. 

{3:26} For the LORD shall be thy confidence,and shall keep thy foot from being taken.   

{3:27} Withhold not good from them to whom it is due, when it is inthe power of thine hand to do [it. ]

{3:28} Say not unto thy neighbour,Go, and come again, and to morrow I will give; when thou hast it bythee. 

{3:29} Devise not evil against thy neighbour, seeing he dwellethsecurely by thee.   

{3:30} Strive not with a man without cause, if he have done thee noharm.   

{3:31} Envy thou not the oppressor, and choose none of his ways.

{3:32} For the froward [is] abomination to the LORD: but his secret[is] with the righteous.   

{3:33} The curse of the LORD [is] in the house of the wicked: but heblesseth the habitation of the just. 

{3:34} Surely he scorneth thescorners: but he giveth grace unto the lowly. 

{3:35} The wise shallinherit glory: but shame shall be the promotion of fools.   

{4:1} Hear, ye children, the instruction of a father, and attend toknow understanding. 

{4:2} For I give you good doctrine, forsake ye notmy law. 

{4:3} For I was my father's son, tender and only [beloved] inthe sight of my mother. 

{4:4} He taught me also, and said unto me, Letthine heart retain my words: keep my commandments, and live. 

{4:5} Getwisdom, get understanding: forget [it] not; neither decline from thewords of my mouth. 

{4:6} Forsake her not, and she shall preserve thee:love her, and she shall keep thee. 

{4:7} Wisdom [is] the principalthing; [therefore] get wisdom: and with all thy getting getunderstanding. 

{4:8} Exalt her, and she shall promote thee: she shallbring thee to honour, when thou dost embrace her. 

{4:9} She shall giveto thine head an ornament of grace: a crown of glory shall she deliverto thee. 

{4:10} Hear, O my son, and receive my sayings; and the yearsof thy life shall be many. 

{4:11} I have taught thee in the way ofwisdom; I have led thee in right paths. 

{4:12} When thou goest, thysteps shall not be straitened; and when thou runnest, thou shalt notstumble. 

{4:13} Take fast hold of instruction; let [her] not go: keepher; for she [is] thy life.   

{4:14} Enter not into the path of the wicked, and go not in the wayof evil [men. ]

{4:15} Avoid it, pass not by it, turn from it, and passaway. 

{4:16} For they sleep not, except they have done mischief; andtheir sleep is taken away, unless they cause [some] to fall. 

{4:17} Forthey eat the bread of wickedness, and drink the wine of violence.

{4:18} But the path of the just [is] as the shining light, that shinethmore and more unto the perfect day. 

{4:19} The way of the wicked [is]as darkness: they know not at what they stumble.   

{4:20} My son, attend to my words; incline thine ear unto mysayings. 

{4:21} Let them not depart from thine eyes; keep them in themidst of thine heart. 

{4:22} For they [are] life unto those that findthem, and health to all their flesh.   

{4:23} Keep thy heart with all diligence; for out of it [are] theissues of life. 

{4:24} Put away from thee a froward mouth, and perverselips put far from thee. 

{4:25} Let thine eyes look right on, and letthine eyelids look straight before thee. 

{4:26} Ponder the path of thyfeet, and let all thy ways be established. 

{4:27} Turn not to the righthand nor to the left: remove thy foot from evil.   

{5:1} My son, attend unto my wisdom, [and] bow thine ear to myunderstanding: 

{5:2} That thou mayest regard discretion, and [that] thylips may keep knowledge.   

{5:3} For the lips of a strange woman drop [as] an honeycomb, andher mouth [is] smoother than oil: 

{5:4} But her end is bitter aswormwood, sharp as a twoedged sword. 

{5:5} Her feet go down to death;her steps take hold on hell. 

{5:6} Lest thou shouldest ponder the pathof life, her ways are moveable, [that] thou canst not know [them.]

{5:7} Hear me now therefore, O ye children, and depart not from thewords of my mouth. 

{5:8} Remove thy way far from her, and come not nighthe door of her house: 

{5:9} Lest thou give thine honour unto others,and thy years unto the cruel: 

{5:10} Lest strangers be filled with thywealth; and thy labours [be] in the house of a stranger; 

{5:11} Andthou mourn at the last, when thy flesh and thy body are consumed,

{5:12} And say, How have I hated instruction, and my heart despisedreproof; 

{5:13} And have not obeyed the voice of my teachers, norinclined mine ear to them that instructed me! 

{5:14} I was almost inall evil in the midst of the congregation and assembly.   

{5:15} Drink waters out of thine own cistern, and running waters outof thine own well. 

{5:16} Let thy fountains be dispersed abroad, [and]rivers of waters in the streets. 

{5:17} Let them be only thine own, andnot strangers' with thee. 

{5:18} Let thy fountain be blessed: andrejoice with the wife of thy youth. 

{5:19} [Let her be as] the lovinghind and pleasant roe; let her breasts satisfy thee at all times; andbe thou ravished always with her love. 

{5:20} And why wilt thou, myson, be ravished with a strange woman, and embrace the bosom of astranger? 

{5:21} For the ways of man [are] before the eyes of the LORD,and he pondereth all his goings.   

{5:22} His own iniquities shall take the wicked himself, and heshall be holden with the cords of his sins. 

{5:23} He shall die withoutinstruction; and in the greatness of his folly he shall go astray.   

{6:1} My son, if thou be surety for thy friend, [if] thou haststricken thy hand with a stranger, 

{6:2} Thou art snared with the wordsof thy mouth, thou art taken with the words of thy mouth. 

{6:3} Do thisnow, my son, deliver thyself, when thou art come into the hand of thyfriend; go, humble thyself, and make sure thy friend. 

{6:4} Give notsleep to thine eyes, nor slumber to thine eyelids. 

{6:5} Deliverthyself as a roe from the hand [of the hunter,] and as a bird from thehand of the fowler.   

{6:6} Go to the ant, thou sluggard; consider her ways, and be wise:

{6:7} Which having no guide, overseer, or ruler, 

{6:8} Provideth hermeat in the summer, [and] gathereth her food in the harvest. 

{6:9} Howlong wilt thou sleep, O sluggard? when wilt thou arise out of thysleep? 

{6:10} [Yet] a little sleep, a little slumber, a little foldingof the hands to sleep: 

{6:11} So shall thy poverty come as one thattravelleth, and thy want as an armed man.   

{6:12} A naughty person, a wicked man, walketh with a froward mouth.

{6:13} He winketh with his eyes, he speaketh with his feet, he teachethwith his fingers; 

{6:14} Frowardness [is] in his heart, he devisethmischief continually; he soweth discord. 

{6:15} Therefore shall hiscalamity come suddenly; suddenly shall he be broken without remedy.   

{6:16} These six [things] doth the LORD hate: yea, seven [are] anabomination unto him: 

{6:17} A proud look, a lying tongue, and handsthat shed innocent blood, 

{6:18} An heart that deviseth wickedimaginations, feet that be swift in running to mischief, 

{6:19} A falsewitness [that] speaketh lies, and he that soweth discord among brethren.   

{6:20} My son, keep thy father's commandment, and forsake not thelaw of thy mother: 

{6:21} Bind them continually upon thine heart, [and]tie them about thy neck. 

{6:22} When thou goest, it shall lead thee;when thou sleepest, it shall keep thee; and [when] thou awakest, itshall talk with thee. 

{6:23} For the commandment [is] a lamp; and thelaw [is] light; and reproofs of instruction [are] the way of life:

{6:24} To keep thee from the evil woman, from the flattery of thetongue of a strange woman. 

{6:25} Lust not after her beauty in thineheart; neither let her take thee with her eyelids. 

{6:26} For by meansof a whorish woman [a man is brought] to a piece of bread: and theadulteress will hunt for the precious life. 

{6:27} Can a man take firein his bosom, and his clothes not be burned? 

{6:28} Can one go upon hotcoals, and his feet not be burned? 

{6:29} So he that goeth in to hisneighbour's wife; whosoever toucheth her shall not be innocent. 

{6:30}[Men] do not despise a thief, if he steal to satisfy his soul when heis hungry; 

{6:31} But [if] he be found, he shall restore sevenfold; heshall give all the substance of his house. 

{6:32} [But] whosocommitteth adultery with a woman lacketh understanding: he [that] doethit destroyeth his own soul. 

{6:33} A wound and dishonour shall he get;and his reproach shall not be wiped away. 

{6:34} For jealousy [is] therage of a man: therefore he will not spare in the day of vengeance.

{6:35} He will not regard any ransom; neither will he rest content,though thou givest many gifts.   

{7:1} My son, keep my words, and lay up my commandments with thee.

{7:2} Keep my commandments, and live; and my law as the apple of thineeye. 

{7:3} Bind them upon thy fingers, write them upon the table ofthine heart. 

{7:4} Say unto wisdom, Thou [art] my sister; and callunderstanding [thy] kinswoman: 

{7:5} That they may keep thee from thestrange woman, from the stranger [which] flattereth with her words.   

{7:6} For at the window of my house I looked through my casement,

{7:7} And beheld among the simple ones, I discerned among the youths, ayoung man void of understanding, 

{7:8} Passing through the street nearher corner; and he went the way to her house, 

{7:9} In the twilight, inthe evening, in the black and dark night: 

{7:10} And, behold, there methim a woman [with] the attire of an harlot, and subtil of heart. 

{7:11}(She [is] loud and stubborn; her feet abide not in her house: 

{7:12}Now [is she] without, now in the streets, and lieth in wait at everycorner.) 

{7:13} So she caught him, and kissed him, [and] with animpudent face said unto him, 

{7:14} [I have] peace offerings with me;this day have I payed my vows. 

{7:15} Therefore came I forth to meetthee, diligently to seek thy face, and I have found thee. 

{7:16} I havedecked my bed with coverings of tapestry, with carved [works,] withfine linen of Egypt. 

{7:17} I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes,and cinnamon. 

{7:18} Come, let us take our fill of love until themorning: let us solace ourselves with loves. 

{7:19} For the goodman[is] not at home, he is gone a long journey: 

{7:20} He hath taken a bagof money with him, [and] will come home at the day appointed. 

{7:21}With her much fair speech she caused him to yield, with the flatteringof her lips she forced him. 

{7:22} He goeth after her straightway, asan ox goeth to the slaughter, or as a fool to the correction of thestocks; 

{7:23} Till a dart strike through his liver; as a bird hastethto the snare, and knoweth not that it [is] for his life.   

{7:24} Hearken unto me now therefore, O ye children, and attend tothe words of my mouth. 

{7:25} Let not thine heart decline to her ways,go not astray in her paths. 

{7:26} For she hath cast down many wounded:yea, many strong [men] have been slain by her. 

{7:27} Her house [is]the way to hell, going down to the chambers of death.   

{8:1} Doth not wisdom cry? and understanding put forth her voice?

{8:2} She standeth in the top of high places, by the way in the placesof the paths. 

{8:3} She crieth at the gates, at the entry of the city,at the coming in at the doors. 

{8:4} Unto you, O men, I call; and myvoice [is] to the sons of man. 

{8:5} O ye simple, understand wisdom:and, ye fools, be ye of an understanding heart. 

{8:6} Hear; for I willspeak of excellent things; and the opening of my lips [shall be] rightthings. 

{8:7} For my mouth shall speak truth; and wickedness [is] anabomination to my lips. 

{8:8} All the words of my mouth [are] inrighteousness; [there is] nothing froward or perverse in them. 

{8:9}They [are] all plain to him that understandeth, and right to them thatfind knowledge. 

{8:10} Receive my instruction, and not silver; andknowledge rather than choice gold. 

{8:11} For wisdom [is] better thanrubies; and all the things that may be desired are not to be comparedto it. 

{8:12} I wisdom dwell with prudence, and find out knowledge ofwitty inventions. 

{8:13} The fear of the LORD [is] to hate evil: pride,and arrogancy, and the evil way, and the froward mouth, do I hate.

{8:14} Counsel [is] mine, and sound wisdom: I [am] understanding; Ihave strength. 

{8:15} By me kings reign, and princes decree justice.

{8:16} By me princes rule, and nobles, [even] all the judges of theearth. 

{8:17} I love them that love me; and those that seek me earlyshall find me. 

{8:18} Riches and honour [are] with me; [yea,] durableriches and righteousness. 

{8:19} My fruit [is] better than gold, yea,than fine gold; and my revenue than choice silver. 

{8:20} I lead in theway of righteousness, in the midst of the paths of judgment: 

{8:21}That I may cause those that love me to inherit substance; and I willfill their treasures. 

{8:22} The LORD possessed me in the beginning ofhis way, before his works of old. 

{8:23} I was set up from everlasting,from the beginning, or ever the earth was. 

{8:24} When [there were] nodepths, I was brought forth; when [there were] no fountains aboundingwith water. 

{8:25} Before the mountains were settled, before the hillswas I brought forth: 

{8:26} While as yet he had not made the earth, northe fields, nor the highest part of the dust of the world. 

{8:27} Whenhe prepared the heavens, I [was] there: when he set a compass upon theface of the depth: 

{8:28} When he established the clouds above: when hestrengthened the fountains of the deep: 

{8:29} When he gave to the seahis decree, that the waters should not pass his commandment: when heappointed the foundations of the earth: 

{8:30} Then I was by him, [as]one brought up [with him:] and I was daily [his] delight, rejoicingalways before him; 

{8:31} Rejoicing in the habitable part of his earth;and my delights [were] with the sons of men. 

{8:32} Now thereforehearken unto me, O ye children: for blessed [are they that] keep myways. 

{8:33} Hear instruction, and be wise, and refuse it not. 

{8:34}Blessed [is] the man that heareth me, watching daily at my gates,waiting at the posts of my doors. 

{8:35} For whoso findeth me findethlife, and shall obtain favour of the LORD. 

{8:36} But he that sinnethagainst me wrongeth his own soul: all they that hate me love death.   

{9:1} Wisdom hath builded her house, she hath hewn out her sevenpillars: 

{9:2} She hath killed her beasts; she hath mingled her wine;she hath also furnished her table. 

{9:3} She hath sent forth hermaidens: she crieth upon the highest places of the city, 

{9:4} Whoso[is] simple, let him turn in hither: [as for] him that wantethunderstanding, she saith to him, 

{9:5} Come, eat of my bread, and drinkof the wine [which] I have mingled. 

{9:6} Forsake the foolish, andlive; and go in the way of understanding. 

{9:7} He that reproveth ascorner getteth to himself shame: and he that rebuketh a wicked [mangetteth] himself a blot. 

{9:8} Reprove not a scorner, lest he hatethee: rebuke a wise man, and he will love thee. 

{9:9} Give[instruction] to a wise [man,] and he will be yet wiser: teach a just[man,] and he will increase in learning. 

{9:10} The fear of the LORD[is] the beginning of wisdom: and the knowledge of the holy [is]understanding. 

{9:11} For by me thy days shall be multiplied, and theyears of thy life shall be increased. 

{9:12} If thou be wise, thoushalt be wise for thyself: but [if] thou scornest, thou alone shaltbear [it.]   

{9:13} A foolish woman [is] clamorous: [she is] simple, and knowethnothing. 

{9:14} For she sitteth at the door of her house, on a seat inthe high places of the city, 

{9:15} To call passengers who go right ontheir ways: 

{9:16} Whoso [is] simple, let him turn in hither: and [asfor] him that wanteth understanding, she saith to him, 

{9:17} Stolenwaters are sweet, and bread [eaten] in secret is pleasant. 

{9:18} Buthe knoweth not that the dead [are] there; [and that] her guests [are]in the depths of hell.   

{10:1} The proverbs of Solomon. A wise son maketh a glad father: buta foolish son [is] the heaviness of his mother. 

{10:2} Treasures ofwickedness profit nothing: but righteousness delivereth from death.

{10:3} The LORD will not suffer the soul of the righteous to famish:but he casteth away the substance of the wicked. 

{10:4} He becomethpoor that dealeth [with] a slack hand: but the hand of the diligentmaketh rich. 

{10:5} He that gathereth in summer [is] a wise son: [but]he that sleepeth in harvest [is] a son that causeth shame. 

{10:6}Blessings [are] upon the head of the just: but violence covereth themouth of the wicked. 

{10:7} The memory of the just is blessed: but thename of the wicked shall rot. 

{10:8} The wise in heart will receivecommandments: but a prating fool shall fall. 

{10:9} He that walkethuprightly walketh surely: but he that perverteth his ways shall beknown. 

{10:10} He that winketh with the eye causeth sorrow: but aprating fool shall fall. 

{10:11} The mouth of a righteous [man is] awell of life: but violence covereth the mouth of the wicked. 

{10:12}Hatred stirreth up strifes: but love covereth all sins. 

{10:13} In thelips of him that hath understanding wisdom is found: but a rod [is] forthe back of him that is void of understanding. 

{10:14} Wise [men] layup knowledge: but the mouth of the foolish [is] near destruction.

{10:15} The rich man's wealth [is] his strong city: the destruction ofthe poor [is] their poverty. 

{10:16} The labour of the righteous[tendeth] to life: the fruit of the wicked to sin. 

{10:17} He [is in]the way of life that keepeth instruction: but he that refuseth reprooferreth. 

{10:18} He that hideth hatred [with] lying lips, and he thatuttereth a slander, [is] a fool. 

{10:19} In the multitude of wordsthere wanteth not sin: but he that refraineth his lips [is] wise.

{10:20} The tongue of the just [is as] choice silver: the heart of thewicked [is] little worth. 

{10:21} The lips of the righteous feed many:but fools die for want of wisdom. 

{10:22} The blessing of the LORD, itmaketh rich, and he addeth no sorrow with it. 

{10:23} [It is] as sportto a fool to do mischief: but a man of understanding hath wisdom.

{10:24} The fear of the wicked, it shall come upon him: but the desireof the righteous shall be granted. 

{10:25} As the whirlwind passeth, so[is] the wicked no [more:] but the righteous [is] an everlastingfoundation.

{11:8} The righteous is delivered out of trouble, and thewicked cometh in his stead. 

{11:9} An hypocrite with [his] mouthdestroyeth his neighbour: but through knowledge shall the just bedelivered. 

{11:10} When it goeth well with the righteous, the cityrejoiceth: and when the wicked perish, [there is] shouting. 

{11:11} Bythe blessing of the upright the city is exalted: but it is overthrownby the mouth of the wicked. 

{11:12} He that is void of wisdom despisethhis neighbour: but a man of understanding holdeth his peace. 

{11:13} Atalebearer revealeth secrets: but he that is of a faithful spiritconcealeth the matter. 

{11:14} Where no counsel [is,] the people fall:but in the multitude of counsellors [there is] safety.

{11:23} Thedesire of the righteous [is] only good: [but] the expectation of thewicked [is] wrath. 

{11:24} There is that scattereth, and yetincreaseth; and [there is] that withholdeth more than is meet, but [ittendeth] to poverty. 

{11:25} The liberal soul shall be made fat: and hethat watereth shall be watered also himself. 

{11:26} He thatwithholdeth corn, the people shall curse him: but blessing [shall be]upon the head of him that selleth [it. ]

{11:27} He that diligentlyseeketh good procureth favour: but he that seeketh mischief, it shallcome unto him. 

{11:28} He that trusteth in his riches shall fall: butthe righteous shall flourish as a branch.

{12:10} A righteous [man] regardeth thelife of his beast: but the tender mercies of the wicked [are] cruel.

{12:11} He that tilleth his land shall be satisfied with bread: but hethat followeth vain [persons is] void of understanding.

{12:16} A fool's wrath is presently known: but a prudent [man]covereth shame. 

{12:17} [He that] speaketh truth sheweth forthrighteousness: but a false witness deceit. 

{12:18} There is thatspeaketh like the piercings of a sword: but the tongue of the wise [is]health.

{14:30} A sound heart [is] the life of the flesh: butenvy the rottenness of the bones. 

{14:31} He that oppresseth the poorreproacheth his Maker: but he that honoureth him hath mercy on thepoor. 

{14:32} The wicked is driven away in his wickedness: but therighteous hath hope in his death. 

{14:33} Wisdom resteth in the heartof him that hath understanding: but [that which is] in the midst offools is made known. 

{14:34} Righteousness exalteth a nation: but sin[is] a reproach to any people.

{15:13} A merry heart maketh a cheerful countenance: but bysorrow of the heart the spirit is broken. 

{15:14} The heart of him thathath understanding seeketh knowledge: but the mouth of fools feedeth onfoolishness. 

{15:15} All the days of the afflicted [are] evil: but hethat is of a merry heart [hath] a continual feast. 

{15:16} Better [is]little with the fear of the LORD than great treasure and troubletherewith. 

{15:17} Better [is] a dinner of herbs where love is, than astalled ox and hatred therewith. 

{15:18} A wrathful man stirreth upstrife: but [he that is] slow to anger appeaseth strife.

{15:23} A man hath joy by theanswer of his mouth: and a word [spoken] in due season, how good [isit! ]

{15:24} The way of life [is] above to the wise, that he may departfrom hell beneath. 

{15:25} The LORD will destroy the house of theproud: but he will establish the border of the widow. 

{15:26} Thethoughts of the wicked [are] an abomination to the LORD: but [thewords] of the pure [are] pleasant words. 

{15:27} He that is greedy ofgain troubleth his own house; but he that hateth gifts shall live.

{15:28} The heart of the righteous studieth to answer: but the mouth ofthe wicked poureth out evil things.

{15:30} The lightof the eyes rejoiceth the heart: [and] a good report maketh the bonesfat. 

{15:31} The ear that heareth the reproof of life abideth among thewise. 

{15:32} He that refuseth instruction despiseth his own soul: buthe that heareth reproof getteth understanding.

{16:4} TheLORD hath made all [things] for himself: yea, even the wicked for theday of evil. 

{16:5} Every one [that is] proud in heart [is] anabomination to the LORD: [though] hand [join] in hand, he shall not beunpunished. 

{16:6} By mercy and truth iniquity is purged: and by thefear of the LORD [men] depart from evil.

{16:15} In the light of the king's countenance [is]life; and his favour [is] as a cloud of the latter rain. 

{16:16} Howmuch better [is it] to get wisdom than gold! and to get understandingrather to be chosen than silver! 

{16:17} The highway of the upright[is] to depart from evil: he that keepeth his way preserveth his soul.

{16:18} Pride [goeth] before destruction, and an haughty spirit beforea fall. 

{16:19} Better [it is to be] of an humble spirit with thelowly, than to divide the spoil with the proud. 

{16:20} He thathandleth a matter wisely shall find good: and whoso trusteth in theLORD, happy [is] he. 

{16:21} The wise in heart shall be called prudent:and the sweetness of the lips increaseth learning. 

{16:22}Understanding [is] a wellspring of life unto him that hath it: but theinstruction of fools [is] folly. 

{16:23} The heart of the wise teachethhis mouth, and addeth learning to his lips. 

{16:24} Pleasant words [areas] an honeycomb, sweet to the soul, and health to the bones. 

{16:25}There is a way that seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof [are]the ways of death. 

{16:26} He that laboureth laboureth for himself; forhis mouth craveth it of him. 

{16:27} An ungodly man diggeth up evil:and in his lips [there is] as a burning fire. 

{16:28} A froward mansoweth strife: and a whisperer separateth chief friends. 

{16:29} Aviolent man enticeth his neighbour, and leadeth him into the way [thatis] not good. 

{16:30} He shutteth his eyes to devise froward things:moving his lips he bringeth evil to pass. 

{16:31} The hoary head [is] acrown of glory, [if] it be found in the way of righteousness. 

{16:32}[He that is] slow to anger [is] better than the mighty; and he thatruleth his spirit than he that taketh a city. 

{16:33} The lot is castinto the lap; but the whole disposing thereof [is] of the LORD.   

{17:1} Better [is] a dry morsel, and quietness therewith, than anhouse full of sacrifices [with] strife. 

{17:2} A wise servant shallhave rule over a son that causeth shame, and shall have part of theinheritance among the brethren. 

{17:3} The fining pot [is] for silver,and the furnace for gold: but the LORD trieth the hearts.

{17:5} Whoso mocketh the poor reproacheth his Maker:[and] he that is glad at calamities shall not be unpunished. 

{17:6}Children's children [are] the crown of old men; and the glory ofchildren [are] their fathers. 

{17:7} Excellent speech becometh not afool: much less do lying lips a prince. 

{17:8} A gift [is as] aprecious stone in the eyes of him that hath it: whithersoever itturneth, it prospereth. 

{17:9} He that covereth a transgression seekethlove; but he that repeateth a matter separateth [very] friends. 

{17:10}A reproof entereth more into a wise man than an hundred stripes into afool. 

{17:11} An evil [man] seeketh only rebellion: therefore a cruelmessenger shall be sent against him. 

{17:12} Let a bear robbed of herwhelps meet a man, rather than a fool in his folly. 

{17:13} Whosorewardeth evil for good, evil shall not depart from his house. 

{17:14}The beginning of strife [is as] when one letteth out water: thereforeleave off contention, before it be meddled with. 

{17:15} He thatjustifieth the wicked, and he that condemneth the just, even they both[are] abomination to the LORD. 

{17:16} Wherefore [is there] a price inthe hand of a fool to get wisdom, seeing [he hath] no heart [to it?]

{17:17} A friend loveth at all times, and a brother is born foradversity. 

{17:18} A man void of understanding striketh hands, [and]becometh surety in the presence of his friend. 

{17:19} He lovethtransgression that loveth strife: [and] he that exalteth his gateseeketh destruction. 

{17:20} He that hath a froward heart findeth nogood: and he that hath a perverse tongue falleth into mischief. 

{17:21}He that begetteth a fool [doeth it] to his sorrow: and the father of afool hath no joy. 

{17:22} A merry heart doeth good [like] a medicine:but a broken spirit drieth the bones. 

{17:23} A wicked [man] taketh agift out of the bosom to pervert the ways of judgment. 

{17:24} Wisdom[is] before him that hath understanding; but the eyes of a fool [are]in the ends of the earth. 

{17:25} A foolish son [is] a grief to hisfather, and bitterness to her that bare him. 

{17:26} Also to punish thejust [is] not good, [nor] to strike princes for equity. 

{17:27} He thathath knowledge spareth his words: [and] a man of understanding is of anexcellent spirit. 

{17:28} Even a fool, when he holdeth his peace, iscounted wise: [and] he that shutteth his lips [is esteemed] a man ofunderstanding.   

{18:1} Through desire a man, having separated himself, seeketh [and]intermeddleth with all wisdom. 

{18:2} A fool hath no delight inunderstanding, but that his heart may discover itself. 

{18:3} When thewicked cometh, [then] cometh also contempt, and with ignominy reproach.

{18:4} The words of a man's mouth [are as] deep waters, [and] thewellspring of wisdom [as] a flowing brook. 

{18:5} [It is] not good toaccept the person of the wicked, to overthrow the righteous injudgment. 

{18:6} A fool's lips enter into contention, and his mouthcalleth for strokes. 

{18:7} A fool's mouth [is] his destruction, andhis lips [are] the snare of his soul. 

{18:8} The words of a talebearer[are] as wounds, and they go down into the innermost parts of thebelly. 

{18:9} He also that is slothful in his work is brother to himthat is a great waster. 

{18:10} The name of the LORD [is] a strongtower: the righteous runneth into it, and is safe. 

{18:11} The richman's wealth [is] his strong city, and as an high wall in his ownconceit. 

{18:12} Before destruction the heart of man is haughty, andbefore honour [is] humility. 

{18:13} He that answereth a matter beforehe heareth [it,] it [is] folly and shame unto him. 

{18:14} The spiritof a man will sustain his infirmity; but a wounded spirit who can bear?

{18:15} The heart of the prudent getteth knowledge; and the ear of thewise seeketh knowledge. 

{18:16} A man's gift maketh room for him, andbringeth him before great men. 

{18:17} [He that is] first in his owncause [seemeth] just; but his neighbour cometh and searcheth him.

{18:18} The lot causeth contentions to cease, and parteth between themighty. 

{18:19} A brother offended [is harder to be won] than a strongcity: and [their] contentions [are] like the bars of a castle. 

{18:20}A man's belly shall be satisfied with the fruit of his mouth; [and]with the increase of his lips shall he be filled. 

{18:21} Death andlife [are] in the power of the tongue: and they that love it shall eatthe fruit thereof. 

{18:22} [Whoso] findeth a wife findeth a good[thing,] and obtaineth favour of the LORD. 

{18:23} The poor usethintreaties; but the rich answereth roughly. 

{18:24} A man [that hath]friends must shew himself friendly: and there is a friend [that]sticketh closer than a brother.   

{19:1} Better [is] the poor that walketh in his integrity, than [hethat is] perverse in his lips, and is a fool. 

{19:2} Also, [that] thesoul [be] without knowledge, [it is] not good; and he that hasteth with[his] feet sinneth. 

{19:3} The foolishness of man perverteth his way:and his heart fretteth against the LORD. 

{19:4} Wealth maketh manyfriends; but the poor is separated from his neighbour. 

{19:5} A falsewitness shall not be unpunished, and [he that] speaketh lies shall notescape. 

{19:6} Many will intreat the favour of the prince: and everyman [is] a friend to him that giveth gifts. 

{19:7} All the brethren ofthe poor do hate him: how much more do his friends go far from him? hepursueth [them with] words, [yet] they [are] wanting [to him. ]

{19:8}He that getteth wisdom loveth his own soul: [he that] keepethunderstanding shall find good. 

{19:9} A false witness shall not beunpunished, and he that speaketh lies shall perish. 

{19:10} Delight isnot seemly for a fool; much less for a servant to have rule overprinces. 

{19:11} The discretion of a man deferreth his anger; and [itis] his glory to pass over a transgression. 

{19:12} The king's wrath[is] as the roaring of a lion; but his favour [is] as dew upon thegrass. 

{19:13} A foolish son [is] the calamity of his father: and thecontentions of a wife [are] a continual dropping. 

{19:14} House andriches [are] the inheritance of fathers and a prudent wife [is] fromthe LORD. 

{19:15} Slothfulness casteth into a deep sleep; and an idlesoul shall suffer hunger. 

{19:16} He that keepeth the commandmentkeepeth his own soul; [but] he that despiseth his ways shall die.

{19:17} He that hath pity upon the poor lendeth unto the LORD; and thatwhich he hath given will he pay him again. 

{19:18} Chasten thy sonwhile there is hope, and let not thy soul spare for his crying. 

{19:19}A man of great wrath shall suffer punishment: for if thou deliver[him,] yet thou must do it again. 

{19:20} Hear counsel, and receiveinstruction, that thou mayest be wise in thy latter end. 

{19:21} [Thereare] many devices in a man's heart; nevertheless the counsel of theLORD, that shall stand. 

{19:22} The desire of a man [is] his kindness:and a poor man [is] better than a liar. 

{19:23} The fear of the LORD[tendeth] to life: and [he that hath it] shall abide satisfied; heshall not be visited with evil. 

{19:24} A slothful [man] hideth hishand in [his] bosom, and will not so much as bring it to his mouthagain. 

{19:25} Smite a scorner, and the simple will beware: and reproveone that hath understanding, [and] he will understand knowledge.

{19:26} He that wasteth [his] father, [and] chaseth away [his] mother,[is] a son that causeth shame, and bringeth reproach. 

{19:27} Cease, myson, to hear the instruction [that causeth] to err from the words ofknowledge. 

{19:28} An ungodly witness scorneth judgment: and the mouthof the wicked devoureth iniquity. 

{19:29} Judgments are prepared forscorners, and stripes for the back of fools.   

{20:1} Wine [is] a mocker, strong drink [is] raging: and whosoeveris deceived thereby is not wise. 

{20:2} The fear of a king [is] as theroaring of a lion: [whoso] provoketh him to anger sinneth [against] hisown soul. 

{20:3} [It is] an honour for a man to cease from strife: butevery fool will be meddling. 

{20:4} The sluggard will not plow byreason of the cold; [therefore] shall he beg in harvest, and [have]nothing. 

{20:5} Counsel in the heart of man [is like] deep water; but aman of understanding will draw it out. 

{20:6} Most men will proclaimevery one his own goodness: but a faithful man who can find? 

{20:7} Thejust [man] walketh in his integrity: his children [are] blessed afterhim. 

{20:8} A king that sitteth in the throne of judgment scatterethaway all evil with his eyes. 

{20:9} Who can say, I have made my heartclean, I am pure from my sin? 

{20:10} Divers weights, [and] diversmeasures, both of them [are] alike abomination to the LORD. 

{20:11}Even a child is known by his doings, whether his work [be] pure, andwhether [it be] right. 

{20:12} The hearing ear, and the seeing eye, theLORD hath made even both of them. 

{20:13} Love not sleep, lest thoucome to poverty; open thine eyes, [and] thou shalt be satisfied withbread. 

{20:14} [It is] naught, [it is] naught, saith the buyer: butwhen he is gone his way, then he boasteth. 

{20:15} There is gold, and amultitude of rubies: but the lips of knowledge [are] a precious jewel.

{20:16} Take his garment that is surety [for] a stranger: and take apledge of him for a strange woman. 

{20:17} Bread of deceit [is] sweetto a man; but afterwards his mouth shall be filled with gravel. 

{20:18}[Every] purpose is established by counsel: and with good advice makewar. 

{20:19} He that goeth about [as] a talebearer revealeth secrets:therefore meddle not with him that flattereth with his lips. 

{20:20}Whoso curseth his father or his mother, his lamp shall be put out inobscure darkness. 

{20:21} An inheritance [may be] gotten hastily at thebeginning; but the end thereof shall not be blessed. 

{20:22} Say notthou, I will recompense evil; [but] wait on the LORD, and he shall savethee. 

{20:23} Divers weights [are] an abomination unto the LORD; and afalse balance [is] not good. 

{20:24} Man's goings [are] of the LORD;how can a man then understand his own way? 

{20:25} [It is] a snare tothe man [who] devoureth [that which is] holy, and after vows to makeenquiry. 

{20:26} A wise king scattereth the wicked, and bringeth thewheel over them. 

{20:27} The spirit of man [is] the candle of the LORD,searching all the inward parts of the belly. 

{20:28} Mercy and truthpreserve the king: and his throne is upholden by mercy. 

{20:29} Theglory of young men [is] their strength: and the beauty of old men [is]the grey head. 

{20:30} The blueness of a wound cleanseth away evil: so[do] stripes the inward parts of the belly.   

{21:1} The king's heart [is] in the hand of the LORD, [as] therivers of water: he turneth it whithersoever he will. 

{21:2} Every wayof a man [is] right in his own eyes: but the LORD pondereth the hearts.

{21:3} To do justice and judgment [is] more acceptable to the LORD thansacrifice. 

{21:4} An high look, and a proud heart, [and] the plowing ofthe wicked, [is] sin. 

{21:5} The thoughts of the diligent [tend] onlyto plenteousness; but of every one [that is] hasty only to want. 

{21:6}The getting of treasures by a lying tongue [is] a vanity tossed to andfro of them that seek death. 

{21:7} The robbery of the wicked shalldestroy them; because they refuse to do judgment. 

{21:8} The way of man[is] froward and strange: but [as for] the pure, his work [is] right.

{21:9} [It is] better to dwell in a corner of the housetop, than with abrawling woman in a wide house. 

{21:10} The soul of the wicked desirethevil: his neighbour findeth no favour in his eyes. 

{21:11} When thescorner is punished, the simple is made wise: and when the wise isinstructed, he receiveth knowledge. 

{21:12} The righteous [man] wiselyconsidereth the house of the wicked: [but God] overthroweth the wickedfor [their] wickedness. 

{21:13} Whoso stoppeth his ears at the cry ofthe poor, he also shall cry himself, but shall not be heard. 

{21:14} Agift in secret pacifieth anger: and a reward in the bosom strong wrath.

{21:15} [It is] joy to the just to do judgment: but destruction [shallbe] to the workers of iniquity. 

{21:16} The man that wandereth out ofthe way of understanding shall remain in the congregation of the dead.

{21:17} He that loveth pleasure [shall be] a poor man: he that lovethwine and oil shall not be rich. 

{21:18} The wicked [shall be] a ransomfor the righteous, and the transgressor for the upright. 

{21:19} [Itis] better to dwell in the wilderness, than with a contentious and anangry woman. 

{21:20} [There is] treasure to be desired and oil in thedwelling of the wise; but a foolish man spendeth it up. 

{21:21} He thatfolloweth after righteousness and mercy findeth life, righteousness,and honour. 

{21:22} A wise [man] scaleth the city of the mighty, andcasteth down the strength of the confidence thereof. 

{21:23} Whosokeepeth his mouth and his tongue keepeth his soul from troubles.

{21:24} Proud [and] haughty scorner [is] his name, who dealeth in proudwrath. 

{21:25} The desire of the slothful killeth him; for his handsrefuse to labour. 

{21:26} He coveteth greedily all the day long: butthe righteous giveth and spareth not. 

{21:27} The sacrifice of thewicked [is] abomination: how much more, [when] he bringeth it with awicked mind? 

{21:28} A false witness shall perish: but the man thatheareth speaketh constantly. 

{21:29} A wicked man hardeneth his face:but [as for] the upright, he directeth his way. 

{21:30} [There is] nowisdom nor understanding nor counsel against the LORD. 

{21:31} Thehorse [is] prepared against the day of battle: but safety [is] of theLORD.   

{22:1} A [good] name [is] rather to be chosen than great riches,[and] loving favour rather than silver and gold. 

{22:2} The rich andpoor meet together: the LORD [is] the maker of them all. 

{22:3} Aprudent [man] foreseeth the evil, and hideth himself: but the simplepass on, and are punished. 

{22:4} By humility [and] the fear of theLORD [are] riches, and honour, and life. 

{22:5} Thorns [and] snares[are] in the way of the froward: he that doth keep his soul shall befar from them. 

{22:6} Train up a child in the way he should go: andwhen he is old, he will not depart from it. 

{22:7} The rich ruleth overthe poor, and the borrower [is] servant to the lender. 

{22:8} He thatsoweth iniquity shall reap vanity: and the rod of his anger shall fail.

{22:9} He that hath a bountiful eye shall be blessed; for he giveth ofhis bread to the poor. 

{22:10} Cast out the scorner, and contentionshall go out; yea, strife and reproach shall cease. 

{22:11} He thatloveth pureness of heart, [for] the grace of his lips the king [shallbe] his friend. 

{22:12} The eyes of the LORD preserve knowledge, and heoverthroweth the words of the transgressor. 

{22:13} The slothful [man]saith, [There is] a lion without, I shall be slain in the streets.

{22:14} The mouth of strange women [is] a deep pit: he that is abhorredof the LORD shall fall therein. 

{22:15} Foolishness [is] bound in theheart of a child; [but] the rod of correction shall drive it far fromhim. 

{22:16} He that oppresseth the poor to increase his [riches, and]he that giveth to the rich, [shall] surely [come] to want. 

{22:17} Bowdown thine ear, and hear the words of the wise, and apply thine heartunto my knowledge. 

{22:18} For [it is] a pleasant thing if thou keepthem within thee; they shall withal be fitted in thy lips. 

{22:19} Thatthy trust may be in the LORD, I have made known to thee this day, evento thee. 

{22:20} Have not I written to thee excellent things incounsels and knowledge, 

{22:21} That I might make thee know thecertainty of the words of truth; that thou mightest answer the words oftruth to them that send unto thee? 

{22:22} Rob not the poor, because he[is] poor: neither oppress the afflicted in the gate: 

{22:23} For theLORD will plead their cause, and spoil the soul of those that spoiledthem. 

{22:24} Make no friendship with an angry man; and with a furiousman thou shalt not go: 

{22:25} Lest thou learn his ways, and get asnare to thy soul. 

{22:26} Be not thou [one] of them that strike hands,[or] of them that are sureties for debts. 

{22:27} If thou hast nothingto pay, why should he take away thy bed from under thee? 

{22:28} Removenot the ancient landmark, which thy fathers have set. 

{22:29} Seestthou a man diligent in his business? he shall stand before kings; heshall not stand before mean [men.]   

{23:1} When thou sittest to eat with a ruler, consider diligentlywhat [is] before thee: 

{23:2} And put a knife to thy throat, if thou[be] a man given to appetite. 

{23:3} Be not desirous of his dainties:for they [are] deceitful meat. 

{23:4} Labour not to be rich: cease fromthine own wisdom. 

{23:5} Wilt thou set thine eyes upon that which isnot? for [riches] certainly make themselves wings; they fly away as aneagle toward heaven. 

{23:6} Eat thou not the bread of [him that hath]an evil eye, neither desire thou his dainty meats: 

{23:7} For as hethinketh in his heart, so [is] he: Eat and drink, saith he to thee; buthis heart [is] not with thee. 

{23:8} The morsel [which] thou hast eatenshalt thou vomit up, and lose thy sweet words. 

{23:9} Speak not in theears of a fool: for he will despise the wisdom of thy words. 

{23:10}Remove not the old landmark; and enter not into the fields of thefatherless: 

{23:11} For their redeemer [is] mighty; he shall pleadtheir cause with thee. 

{23:12} Apply thine heart unto instruction, andthine ears to the words of knowledge. 

{23:13} Withhold not correctionfrom the child: for [if] thou beatest him with the rod, he shall notdie. 

{23:14} Thou shalt beat him with the rod, and shalt deliver hissoul from hell. 

{23:15} My son, if thine heart be wise, my heart shallrejoice, even mine. 

{23:16} Yea, my reins shall rejoice, when thy lipsspeak right things. 

{23:17} Let not thine heart envy sinners: but [bethou] in the fear of the LORD all the day long. 

{23:18} For surelythere is an end; and thine expectation shall not be cut off. 

{23:19}Hear thou, my son, and be wise, and guide thine heart in the way.

{23:20} Be not among winebibbers; among riotous eaters of flesh:

{23:21} For the drunkard and the glutton shall come to poverty: anddrowsiness shall clothe [a man] with rags. 

{23:22} Hearken unto thyfather that begat thee, and despise not thy mother when she is old.

{23:23} Buy the truth, and sell [it] not; [also] wisdom, andinstruction, and understanding. 

{23:24} The father of the righteousshall greatly rejoice: and he that begetteth a wise [child] shall havejoy of him. 

{23:25} Thy father and thy mother shall be glad, and shethat bare thee shall rejoice. 

{23:26} My son, give me thine heart, andlet thine eyes observe my ways. 

{23:27} For a whore [is] a deep ditch;and a strange woman [is] a narrow pit. 

{23:28} She also lieth in waitas [for] a prey, and increaseth the transgressors among men. 

{23:29}Who hath woe? who hath sorrow? who hath contentions? who hath babbling?who hath wounds without cause? who hath redness of eyes? 

{23:30} Theythat tarry long at the wine; they that go to seek mixed wine. 

{23:31}Look not thou upon the wine when it is red, when it giveth his colourin the cup, [when] it moveth itself aright. 

{23:32} At the last itbiteth like a serpent, and stingeth like an adder. 

{23:33} Thine eyesshall behold strange women, and thine heart shall utter perversethings. 

{23:34} Yea, thou shalt be as he that lieth down in the midstof the sea, or as he that lieth upon the top of a mast. 

{23:35} Theyhave stricken me, [shalt thou say, and] I was not sick; they havebeaten me, [and] I felt [it] not: when shall I awake? I will seek ityet again.   

{24:1} Be not thou envious against evil men, neither desire to bewith them. 

{24:2} For their heart studieth destruction, and their lipstalk of mischief. 

{24:3} Through wisdom is an house builded; and byunderstanding it is established: 

{24:4} And by knowledge shall thechambers be filled with all precious and pleasant riches. 

{24:5} A wiseman [is] strong; yea, a man of knowledge increaseth strength. 

{24:6}For by wise counsel thou shalt make thy war: and in multitude ofcounsellors [there is] safety. 

{24:7} Wisdom [is] too high for a fool:he openeth not his mouth in the gate. 

{24:8} He that deviseth to doevil shall be called a mischievous person. 

{24:9} The thought offoolishness [is] sin: and the scorner [is] an abomination to men.

{24:10} [If] thou faint in the day of adversity, thy strength [is]small. 

{24:11} If thou forbear to deliver [them that are] drawn untodeath, and [those that are] ready to be slain; 

{24:12} If thou sayest,Behold, we knew it not; doth not he that pondereth the heart consider[it?] and he that keepeth thy soul, doth [not] he know [it?] and shall[not] he render to [every] man according to his works? 

{24:13} My son,eat thou honey, because [it is] good; and the honeycomb, [which is]sweet to thy taste: 

{24:14} So [shall] the knowledge of wisdom [be]unto thy soul: when thou hast found [it,] then there shall be a reward,and thy expectation shall not be cut off. 

{24:15} Lay not wait, Owicked [man,] against the dwelling of the righteous; spoil not hisresting place: 

{24:16} For a just [man] falleth seven times, and risethup again: but the wicked shall fall into mischief. 

{24:17} Rejoice notwhen thine enemy falleth, and let not thine heart be glad when hestumbleth: 

{24:18} Lest the LORD see [it,] and it displease him, and heturn away his wrath from him. 

{24:19} Fret not thyself because of evil[men,] neither be thou envious at the wicked; 

{24:20} For there shallbe no reward to the evil [man;] the candle of the wicked shall be putout. 

{24:21} My son, fear thou the LORD and the king: [and] meddle notwith them that are given to change: 

{24:22} For their calamity shallrise suddenly; and who knoweth the ruin of them both? 

{24:23} These[things] also [belong] to the wise. [It is] not good to have respect ofpersons in judgment. 

{24:24} He that saith unto the wicked, Thou [art]righteous; him shall the people curse, nations shall abhor him: 

{24:25}But to them that rebuke [him] shall be delight, and a good blessingshall come upon them. 

{24:26} [Every man] shall kiss [his] lips thatgiveth a right answer. 

{24:27} Prepare thy work without, and make itfit for thyself in the field; and afterwards build thine house. 

{24:28}Be not a witness against thy neighbour without cause; and deceive [not]with thy lips. 

{24:29} Say not, I will do so to him as he hath done tome: I will render to the man according to his work. 

{24:30} I went bythe field of the slothful, and by the vineyard of the man void ofunderstanding; 

{24:31} And, lo, it was all grown over with thorns,[and] nettles had covered the face thereof, and the stone wall thereofwas broken down. 

{24:32} Then I saw, [and] considered [it] well: Ilooked upon [it, and] received instruction. 

{24:33} [Yet] a littlesleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep:

{24:34} So shall thy poverty come as one that travelleth; and thy wantas an armed man.   

{25:1} These [are] also proverbs of Solomon, which the men ofHezekiah king of Judah copied out. 

{25:2} [It is] the glory of God toconceal a thing: but the honour of kings [is] to search out a matter.

{25:3} The heaven for height, and the earth for depth, and the heart ofkings [is] unsearchable. 

{25:4} Take away the dross from the silver,and there shall come forth a vessel for the finer. 

{25:5} Take away thewicked [from] before the king, and his throne shall be established inrighteousness. 

{25:6} Put not forth thyself in the presence of theking, and stand not in the place of great [men: ]

{25:7} For better [itis] that it be said unto thee, Come up hither; than that thou shouldestbe put lower in the presence of the prince whom thine eyes have seen.

{25:8} Go not forth hastily to strive, lest [thou know not] what to doin the end thereof, when thy neighbour hath put thee to shame. 

{25:9}Debate thy cause with thy neighbour [himself;] and discover not asecret to another: 

{25:10} Lest he that heareth [it] put thee to shame,and thine infamy turn not away. 

{25:11} A word fitly spoken [is like]apples of gold in pictures of silver. 

{25:12} [As] an earring of gold,and an ornament of fine gold, [so is] a wise reprover upon an obedientear. 

{25:13} As the cold of snow in the time of harvest, [so is] afaithful messenger to them that send him: for he refresheth the soul ofhis masters. 

{25:14} Whoso boasteth himself of a false gift [is like]clouds and wind without rain. 

{25:15} By long forbearing is a princepersuaded, and a soft tongue breaketh the bone. 

{25:16} Hast thou foundhoney? eat so much as is sufficient for thee, lest thou be filledtherewith, and vomit it. 

{25:17} Withdraw thy foot from thy neighbour'shouse; lest he be weary of thee, and [so] hate thee. 

{25:18} A man thatbeareth false witness against his neighbour [is] a maul, and a sword,and a sharp arrow. 

{25:19} Confidence in an unfaithful man in time oftrouble [is like] a broken tooth, and a foot out of joint. 

{25:20} [As]he that taketh away a garment in cold weather, [and as] vinegar uponnitre, so [is] he that singeth songs to an heavy heart. 

{25:21} Ifthine enemy be hungry, give him bread to eat; and if he be thirsty,give him water to drink: 

{25:22} For thou shalt heap coals of fire uponhis head, and the LORD shall reward thee. 

{25:23} The north winddriveth away rain: so [doth] an angry countenance a backbiting tongue.

{25:24} [It is] better to dwell in the corner of the housetop, thanwith a brawling woman and in a wide house. 

{25:25} [As] cold waters toa thirsty soul, so [is] good news from a far country. 

{25:26} Arighteous man falling down before the wicked [is as] a troubledfountain, and a corrupt spring. 

{25:27} [It is ]not good to eat muchhoney: so [for men ]to search their own glory [is not ]glory. 

{25:28}He that [hath] no rule over his own spirit [is like] a city [that is]broken down, [and] without walls.   

{26:1} As snow in summer, and as rain in harvest, so honour is notseemly for a fool. 

{26:2} As the bird by wandering, as the swallow byflying, so the curse causeless shall not come. 

{26:3} A whip for thehorse, a bridle for the ass, and a rod for the fool's back. 

{26:4}Answer not a fool according to his folly, lest thou also be like untohim. 

{26:5} Answer a fool according to his folly, lest he be wise inhis own conceit. 

{26:6} He that sendeth a message by the hand of a foolcutteth off the feet, [and] drinketh damage. 

{26:7} The legs of thelame are not equal: so [is] a parable in the mouth of fools. 

{26:8} Ashe that bindeth a stone in a sling, so [is] he that giveth honour to afool. 

{26:9} [As] a thorn goeth up into the hand of a drunkard, so [is]a parable in the mouth of fools. 

{26:10} The great [God] that formedall [things] both rewardeth the fool, and rewardeth transgressors.

{26:11} As a dog returneth to his vomit, [so] a fool returneth to hisfolly. 

{26:12} Seest thou a man wise in his own conceit? [there is]more hope of a fool than of him. 

{26:13} The slothful [man] saith,[There is] a lion in the way; a lion [is] in the streets. 

{26:14} [As]the door turneth upon his hinges, so [doth] the slothful upon his bed.

{26:15} The slothful hideth his hand in [his] bosom; it grieveth him tobring it again to his mouth. 

{26:16} The sluggard [is] wiser in his ownconceit than seven men that can render a reason. 

{26:17} He thatpasseth by, [and] meddleth with strife [belonging] not to him, [islike] one that taketh a dog by the ears. 

{26:18} As a mad [man] whocasteth firebrands, arrows, and death, 

{26:19} So [is] the man [that]deceiveth his neighbour, and saith, Am not I in sport? 

{26:20} Where nowood is, [there] the fire goeth out: so where [there is] no talebearer,the strife ceaseth. 

{26:21} [As] coals [are] to burning coals, and woodto fire; so [is] a contentious man to kindle strife. 

{26:22} The wordsof a talebearer [are] as wounds, and they go down into the innermostparts of the belly. 

{26:23} Burning lips and a wicked heart [are like]a potsherd covered with silver dross. 

{26:24} He that hatethdissembleth with his lips, and layeth up deceit within him; 

{26:25}When he speaketh fair, believe him not: for [there are] sevenabominations in his heart. 

{26:26} [Whose] hatred is covered by deceit,his wickedness shall be shewed before the [whole] congregation. 

{26:27}Whoso diggeth a pit shall fall therein: and he that rolleth a stone, itwill return upon him. 

{26:28} A lying tongue hateth [those that are]afflicted by it; and a flattering mouth worketh ruin.   

{27:1} Boast not thyself of to morrow; for thou knowest not what aday may bring forth. 

{27:2} Let another man praise thee, and not thineown mouth; a stranger, and not thine own lips. 

{27:3} A stone [is]heavy, and the sand weighty; but a fool's wrath [is] heavier than themboth. 

{27:4} Wrath [is] cruel, and anger [is] outrageous; but who [is]able to stand before envy? 

{27:5} Open rebuke [is] better than secretlove. 

{27:6} Faithful [are] the wounds of a friend; but the kisses ofan enemy [are] deceitful. 

{27:7} The full soul loatheth an honeycomb;but to the hungry soul every bitter thing is sweet. 

{27:8} As a birdthat wandereth from her nest, so [is] a man that wandereth from hisplace. 

{27:9} Ointment and perfume rejoice the heart: so [doth] thesweetness of a man's friend by hearty counsel. 

{27:10} Thine ownfriend, and thy father's friend, forsake not; neither go into thybrother's house in the day of thy calamity: [for] better [is] aneighbour [that is] near than a brother far off. 

{27:11} My son, bewise, and make my heart glad, that I may answer him that reproachethme. 

{27:12} A prudent [man] foreseeth the evil, [and] hideth himself;[but] the simple pass on, [and] are punished. 

{27:13} Take his garmentthat is surety for a stranger, and take a pledge of him for a strangewoman. 

{27:14} He that blesseth his friend with a loud voice, risingearly in the morning, it shall be counted a curse to him. 

{27:15} Acontinual dropping in a very rainy day and a contentious woman arealike. 

{27:16} Whosoever hideth her hideth the wind, and the ointmentof his right hand, [which] bewrayeth [itself. ]

{27:17} Iron sharpenethiron; so a man sharpeneth the countenance of his friend. 

{27:18} Whosokeepeth the fig tree shall eat the fruit thereof: so he that waiteth onhis master shall be honoured. 

{27:19} As in water face [answereth] toface, so the heart of man to man. 

{27:20} Hell and destruction arenever full; so the eyes of man are never satisfied. 

{27:21} [As] thefining pot for silver, and the furnace for gold; so [is] a man to hispraise. 

{27:22} Though thou shouldest bray a fool in a mortar amongwheat with a pestle, [yet] will not his foolishness depart from him.

{27:23} Be thou diligent to know the state of thy flocks, [and] lookwell to thy herds. 

{27:24} For riches [are] not for ever: and doth thecrown [endure] to every generation? 

{27:25} The hay appeareth, and thetender grass sheweth itself, and herbs of the mountains are gathered.

{27:26} The lambs [are] for thy clothing, and the goats [are] the priceof the field. 

{27:27} And [thou shalt have] goats' milk enough for thyfood, for the food of thy household, and [for] the maintenance for thymaidens.   

{28:1} The wicked flee when no man pursueth: but the righteous arebold as a lion. 

{28:2} For the transgression of a land many [are] theprinces thereof: but by a man of understanding [and] knowledge thestate [thereof] shall be prolonged. 

{28:3} A poor man that oppresseththe poor [is like] a sweeping rain which leaveth no food. 

{28:4} Theythat forsake the law praise the wicked: but such as keep the lawcontend with them. 

{28:5} Evil men understand not judgment: but theythat seek the LORD understand all [things. ]

{28:6} Better [is] the poorthat walketh in his uprightness, than [he that is] perverse [in his]ways, though he [be] rich. 

{28:7} Whoso keepeth the law [is] a wiseson: but he that is a companion of riotous [men] shameth his father.

{28:8} He that by usury and unjust gain increaseth his substance, heshall gather it for him that will pity the poor. 

{28:9} He that turnethaway his ear from hearing the law, even his prayer [shall be]abomination. 

{28:10} Whoso causeth the righteous to go astray in anevil way, he shall fall himself into his own pit: but the upright shallhave good [things] in possession. 

{28:11} The rich man [is] wise in hisown conceit; but the poor that hath understanding searcheth him out.

{28:12} When righteous [men] do rejoice, [there is] great glory: butwhen the wicked rise, a man is hidden. 

{28:13} He that covereth hissins shall not prosper: but whoso confesseth and forsaketh [them] shallhave mercy. 

{28:14} Happy [is] the man that feareth alway: but he thathardeneth his heart shall fall into mischief. 

{28:15} [As] a roaringlion, and a ranging bear; [so is] a wicked ruler over the poor people.

{28:16} The prince that wanteth understanding [is] also a greatoppressor: [but] he that hateth covetousness shall prolong [his] days.

{28:17} A man that doeth violence to the blood of [any] person shallflee to the pit; let no man stay him. 

{28:18} Whoso walketh uprightlyshall be saved: but [he that is] perverse [in his] ways shall fall atonce. 

{28:19} He that tilleth his land shall have plenty of bread: buthe that followeth after vain [persons] shall have poverty enough.

{28:20} A faithful man shall abound with blessings: but he that makethhaste to be rich shall not be innocent. 

{28:21} To have respect ofpersons [is] not good: for for a piece of bread [that] man willtransgress. 

{28:22} He that hasteth to be rich [hath] an evil eye, andconsidereth not that poverty shall come upon him. 

{28:23} He thatrebuketh a man afterwards shall find more favour than he thatflattereth with the tongue. 

{28:24} Whoso robbeth his father or hismother, and saith, [It is] no transgression; the same [is] thecompanion of a destroyer. 

{28:25} He that is of a proud heart stirrethup strife: but he that putteth his trust in the LORD shall be made fat.

{28:26} He that trusteth in his own heart is a fool: but whoso walkethwisely, he shall be delivered. 

{28:27} He that giveth unto the poorshall not lack: but he that hideth his eyes shall have many a curse.

{28:28} When the wicked rise, men hide themselves: but when theyperish, the righteous increase.   

{29:1} He, that being often reproved hardeneth [his] neck, shallsuddenly be destroyed, and that without remedy. 

{29:2} When therighteous are in authority, the people rejoice: but when the wickedbeareth rule, the people mourn. 

{29:3} Whoso loveth wisdom rejoicethhis father: but he that keepeth company with harlots spendeth [his]substance. 

{29:4} The king by judgment establisheth the land: but hethat receiveth gifts overthroweth it. 

{29:5} A man that flattereth hisneighbour spreadeth a net for his feet. 

{29:6} In the transgression ofan evil man [there is] a snare: but the righteous doth sing andrejoice. 

{29:7} The righteous considereth the cause of the poor: [but]the wicked regardeth not to know [it. ]

{29:8} Scornful men bring a cityinto a snare: but wise [men] turn away wrath. 

{29:9} [If] a wise mancontendeth with a foolish man, whether he rage or laugh, [there is] norest. 

{29:10} The bloodthirsty hate the upright: but the just seek hissoul. 

{29:11} A fool uttereth all his mind: but a wise [man] keepeth itin till afterwards. 

{29:12} If a ruler hearken to lies, all hisservants [are] wicked. 

{29:13} The poor and the deceitful man meettogether: the LORD lighteneth both their eyes. 

{29:14} The king thatfaithfully judgeth the poor, his throne shall be established for ever.

{29:15} The rod and reproof give wisdom: but a child left [to himself]bringeth his mother to shame. 

{29:16} When the wicked are multiplied,transgression increaseth: but the righteous shall see their fall.

{29:17} Correct thy son, and he shall give thee rest; yea, he shallgive delight unto thy soul. 

{29:18} Where [there is] no vision, thepeople perish: but he that keepeth the law, happy [is] he. 

{29:19} Aservant will not be corrected by words: for though he understand hewill not answer. 

{29:20} Seest thou a man [that is] hasty in his words?[there is] more hope of a fool than of him. 

{29:21} He that delicatelybringeth up his servant from a child shall have him become [his] son atthe length. 

{29:22} An angry man stirreth up strife, and a furious manaboundeth in transgression. 

{29:23} A man's pride shall bring him low:but honour shall uphold the humble in spirit. 

{29:24} Whoso is partnerwith a thief hateth his own soul: he heareth cursing, and bewrayeth[it] not. 

{29:25} The fear of man bringeth a snare: but whoso puttethhis trust in the LORD shall be safe. 

{29:26} Many seek the ruler'sfavour; but [every] man's judgment [cometh] from the LORD. 

{29:27} Anunjust man [is] an abomination to the just: and [he that is] upright inthe way [is] abomination to the wicked.   

{30:1} The words of Agur the son of Jakeh, [even] the prophecy: theman spake unto Ithiel, even unto Ithiel and Ucal, 

{30:2} Surely I [am]more brutish than [any] man, and have not the understanding of a man.

{30:3} I neither learned wisdom, nor have the knowledge of the holy.

{30:4} Who hath ascended up into heaven, or descended? who hathgathered the wind in his fists? who hath bound the waters in a garment?who hath established all the ends of the earth? what [is] his name, andwhat [is] his son's name, if thou canst tell? 

{30:5} Every word of God[is] pure: he [is] a shield unto them that put their trust in him.

{30:6} Add thou not unto his words, lest he reprove thee, and thou befound a liar. 

{30:7} Two [things] have I required of thee; deny me[them] not before I die: 

{30:8} Remove far from me vanity and lies:give me neither poverty nor riches; feed me with food convenient forme: 

{30:9} Lest I be full, and deny [thee,] and say, Who [is] the LORD?or lest I be poor, and steal, and take the name of my God [in vain.]

{30:10} Accuse not a servant unto his master, lest he curse thee, andthou be found guilty. 

{30:11} [There is] a generation [that] curseththeir father, and doth not bless their mother. 

{30:12} [There is] ageneration [that are] pure in their own eyes, and [yet] is not washedfrom their filthiness. 

{30:13} [There is] a generation, O how lofty aretheir eyes! and their eyelids are lifted up. 

{30:14} [There is] ageneration, whose teeth [are as] swords, and their jaw teeth [as]knives, to devour the poor from off the earth, and the needy from[among] men. 

{30:15} The horseleach hath two daughters, [crying,] Give,give. There are three [things that are] never satisfied, [yea,] four[things] say not, [It is] enough: 

{30:16} The grave; and the barrenwomb; the earth [that] is not filled with water; and the fire [that]saith not, [It is] enough. 

{30:17} The eye [that] mocketh at [his]father, and despiseth to obey [his] mother, the ravens of the valleyshall pick it out, and the young eagles shall eat it. 

{30:18} There bethree [things which] are too wonderful for me, yea, four which I knownot: 

{30:19} The way of an eagle in the air; the way of a serpent upona rock; the way of a ship in the midst of the sea; and the way of a manwith a maid. 

{30:20} Such [is] the way of an adulterous woman; sheeateth, and wipeth her mouth, and saith, I have done no wickedness.

{30:21} For three [things] the earth is disquieted, and for four[which] it cannot bear: 

{30:22} For a servant when he reigneth; and afool when he is filled with meat; 

{30:23} For an odious [woman] whenshe is married; and an handmaid that is heir to her mistress. 

{30:24}There be four [things which are] little upon the earth, but they [are]exceeding wise: 

{30:25} The ants [are] a people not strong, yet theyprepare their meat in the summer; 

{30:26} The conies [are but] a feeblefolk, yet make they their houses in the rocks; 

{30:27} The locusts haveno king, yet go they forth all of them by bands; 

{30:28} The spidertaketh hold with her hands, and is in kings' palaces. 

{30:29} There bethree [things] which go well, yea, four are comely in going: 

{30:30} Alion [which is] strongest among beasts, and turneth not away for any;

{30:31} A greyhound; an he goat also; and a king, against whom [thereis] no rising up. 

{30:32} If thou hast done foolishly in lifting upthyself, or if thou hast thought evil, [lay] thine hand upon thy mouth.

{30:33} Surely the churning of milk bringeth forth butter, and thewringing of the nose bringeth forth blood: so the forcing of wrathbringeth forth strife.   

{31:1} The words of king Lemuel, the prophecy that his mother taughthim. 

{31:2} What, my son? and what, the son of my womb? and what, theson of my vows? 

{31:3} Give not thy strength unto women, nor thy waysto that which destroyeth kings. 

{31:4} [It is] not for kings, O Lemuel,[it is] not for kings to drink wine; nor for princes strong drink:

{31:5} Lest they drink, and forget the law, and pervert the judgment ofany of the afflicted. 

{31:6} Give strong drink unto him that is readyto perish, and wine unto those that be of heavy hearts. 

{31:7} Let himdrink, and forget his poverty, and remember his misery no more. 

{31:8}Open thy mouth for the dumb in the cause of all such as are appointedto destruction. 

{31:9} Open thy mouth, judge righteously, and plead thecause of the poor and needy.   

{31:10} Who can find a virtuous woman? for her price [is] far aboverubies. 

{31:11} The heart of her husband doth safely trust in her, sothat he shall have no need of spoil. 

{31:12} She will do him good andnot evil all the days of her life. 

{31:13} She seeketh wool, and flax,and worketh willingly with her hands. 

{31:14} She is like themerchants' ships; she bringeth her food from afar. 

{31:15} She risethalso while it is yet night, and giveth meat to her household, and aportion to her maidens. 

{31:16} She considereth a field, and buyeth it:with the fruit of her hands she planteth a vineyard. 

{31:17} Shegirdeth her loins with strength, and strengtheneth her arms. 

{31:18}She perceiveth that her merchandise [is] good: her candle goeth not outby night. 

{31:19} She layeth her hands to the spindle, and her handshold the distaff. 

{31:20} She stretcheth out her hand to the poor; yea,she reacheth forth her hands to the needy. 

{31:21} She is not afraid ofthe snow for her household: for all her household [are] clothed withscarlet. 

{31:22} She maketh herself coverings of tapestry; her clothing[is] silk and purple. 

{31:23} Her husband is known in the gates, whenhe sitteth among the elders of the land. 

{31:24} She maketh fine linen,and selleth [it;] and delivereth girdles unto the merchant. 

{31:25}Strength and honour [are] her clothing; and she shall rejoice in timeto come. 

{31:26} She openeth her mouth with wisdom; and in her tongue[is] the law of kindness. 

{31:27} She looketh well to the ways of herhousehold, and eateth not the bread of idleness. 

{31:28} Her childrenarise up, and call her blessed; her husband [also,] and he praisethher. 

{31:29} Many daughters have done virtuously, but thou excellestthem all. 

{31:30} Favour [is] deceitful, and beauty [is] vain: [but] awoman [that] feareth the LORD, she shall be praised. 

{31:31} Give herof the fruit of her hands; and let her own works praise her in thegates.
