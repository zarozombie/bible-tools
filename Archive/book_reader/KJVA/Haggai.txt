{Haggai   

{1:1} In the second year of Darius the king, in the sixth month, inthe first day of the month, came the word of the LORD by Haggai theprophet unto Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and toJoshua the son of Josedech, the high priest, saying, 

{1:2} Thusspeaketh the LORD of hosts, saying, This people say, The time is notcome, the time that the LORD'S house should be built. 

{1:3} Then camethe word of the LORD by Haggai the prophet, saying, 

{1:4} [Is it] timefor you, O ye, to dwell in your cieled houses, and this house [lie]waste? 

{1:5} Now therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts; Consider yourways. 

{1:6} Ye have sown much, and bring in little; ye eat, but ye havenot enough; ye drink, but ye are not filled with drink; ye clothe you,but there is none warm; and he that earneth wages earneth wages [to putit] into a bag with holes.   

{1:7} Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Consider your ways. 

{1:8} Go upto the mountain, and bring wood, and build the house; and I will takepleasure in it, and I will be glorified, saith the LORD. 

{1:9} Yelooked for much, and, lo, [it came] to little; and when ye brought [it]home, I did blow upon it. Why? saith the LORD of hosts. Because of minehouse that [is] waste, and ye run every man unto his own house. 

{1:10}Therefore the heaven over you is stayed from dew, and the earth isstayed [from] her fruit. 

{1:11} And I called for a drought upon theland, and upon the mountains, and upon the corn, and upon the new wine,and upon the oil, and upon [that] which the ground bringeth forth, andupon men, and upon cattle, and upon all the labour of the hands.   

{1:12} Then Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Joshua the son ofJosedech, the high priest, with all the remnant of the people, obeyedthe voice of the LORD their God, and the words of Haggai the prophet,as the LORD their God had sent him, and the people did fear before theLORD. 

{1:13} Then spake Haggai the LORD'S messenger in the LORD'Smessage unto the people, saying, I [am] with you, saith the LORD.

{1:14} And the LORD stirred up the spirit of Zerubbabel the son ofShealtiel, governor of Judah, and the spirit of Joshua the son ofJosedech, the high priest, and the spirit of all the remnant of thepeople; and they came and did work in the house of the LORD of hosts,their God, 

{1:15} In the four and twentieth day of the sixth month, inthe second year of Darius the king.   

{2:1} In the seventh [month,] in the one and twentieth [day] of themonth, came the word of the LORD by the prophet Haggai, saying, 

{2:2}Speak now to Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and toJoshua the son of Josedech, the high priest, and to the residue of thepeople, saying, 

{2:3} Who [is] left among you that saw this house inher first glory? and how do ye see it now? [is it] not in your eyes incomparison of it as nothing? 

{2:4} Yet now be strong, O Zerubbabel,saith the LORD; and be strong, O Joshua, son of Josedech, the highpriest; and be strong, all ye people of the land, saith the LORD, andwork: for [I am] with you, saith the LORD of hosts: 

{2:5} [Accordingto] the word that I covenanted with you when ye came out of Egypt, somy spirit remaineth among you: fear ye not. 

{2:6} For thus saith theLORD of hosts; Yet once, it [is] a little while, and I will shake theheavens, and the earth, and the sea, and the dry [land; ]

{2:7} And Iwill shake all nations, and the desire of all nations shall come: and Iwill fill this house with glory, saith the LORD of hosts. 

{2:8} Thesilver [is] mine, and the gold [is] mine, saith the LORD of hosts.

{2:9} The glory of this latter house shall be greater than of theformer, saith the LORD of hosts: and in this place will I give peace,saith the LORD of hosts.   

{2:10} In the four and twentieth [day] of the ninth [month,] in thesecond year of Darius, came the word of the LORD by Haggai the prophet,saying, 

{2:11} Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Ask now the priests[concerning] the law, saying, 

{2:12} If one bear holy flesh in theskirt of his garment, and with his skirt do touch bread, or pottage, orwine, or oil, or any meat, shall it be holy? And the priests answeredand said, No. 

{2:13} Then said Haggai, If [one that is] unclean by adead body touch any of these, shall it be unclean? And the priestsanswered and said, It shall be unclean. 

{2:14} Then answered Haggai,and said, So [is] this people, and so [is] this nation before me, saiththe LORD; and so [is] every work of their hands; and that which theyoffer there [is] unclean. 

{2:15} And now, I pray you, consider fromthis day and upward, from before a stone was laid upon a stone in thetemple of the LORD: 

{2:16} Since those [days] were, when [one] came toan heap of twenty [measures,] there were [but] ten: when [one] came tothe pressfat for to draw out fifty [vessels] out of the press, therewere [but] twenty. 

{2:17} I smote you with blasting and with mildew andwith hail in all the labours of your hands; yet ye [turned] not to me,saith the LORD. 

{2:18} Consider now from this day and upward, from thefour and twentieth day of the ninth [month, even] from the day that thefoundation of the LORD'S temple was laid, consider [it. ]

{2:19} Is theseed yet in the barn? yea, as yet the vine, and the fig tree, and thepomegranate, and the olive tree, hath not brought forth: from this daywill I bless [you.]   

{2:20} And again the word of the LORD came unto Haggai in the fourand twentieth [day] of the month, saying, 

{2:21} Speak to Zerubbabel,governor of Judah, saying, I will shake the heavens and the earth;

{2:22} And I will overthrow the throne of kingdoms, and I will destroythe strength of the kingdoms of the heathen; and I will overthrow thechariots, and those that ride in them; and the horses and their ridersshall come down, every one by the sword of his brother. 

{2:23} In thatday, saith the LORD of hosts, will I take thee, O Zerubbabel, myservant, the son of Shealtiel, saith the LORD, and will make thee as asignet: for I have chosen thee, saith the LORD of hosts.
