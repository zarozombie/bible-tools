{The Gospel According to St. John   

{1:1} In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, andthe Word was God. 

{1:2} The same was in the beginning with God. 

{1:3}All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing madethat was made. 

{1:4} In him was life; and the life was the light ofmen. 

{1:5} And the light shineth in darkness; and the darknesscomprehended it not.   

{1:6} There was a man sent from God, whose name [was] John. 

{1:7}The same came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light, that all[men] through him might believe. 

{1:8} He was not that Light, but [wassent] to bear witness of that Light. 

{1:9} [That] was the true Light,which lighteth every man that cometh into the world. 

{1:10} He was inthe world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not.

{1:11} He came unto his own, and his own received him not. 

{1:12} Butas many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons ofGod, [even] to them that believe on his name: 

{1:13} Which were born,not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, butof God. 

{1:14} And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and webeheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,)full of grace and truth.   

{1:15} John bare witness of him, and cried, saying, This was he ofwhom I spake, He that cometh after me is preferred before me: for hewas before me. 

{1:16} And of his fulness have all we received, andgrace for grace. 

{1:17} For the law was given by Moses, [but] grace andtruth came by Jesus Christ. 

{1:18} No man hath seen God at any time;the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he hathdeclared [him.]   

{1:19} And this is the record of John, when the Jews sent priestsand Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, Who art thou? 

{1:20} And heconfessed, and denied not; but confessed, I am not the Christ. 

{1:21}And they asked him, What then? Art thou Elias? And he saith, I am not.Art thou that prophet? And he answered, No. 

{1:22} Then said they untohim, Who art thou? that we may give an answer to them that sent us.What sayest thou of thyself? 

{1:23} He said, I [am] the voice of onecrying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord, as saidthe prophet Esaias. 

{1:24} And they which were sent were of thePharisees. 

{1:25} And they asked him, and said unto him, Why baptizestthou then, if thou be not that Christ, nor Elias, neither that prophet?

{1:26} John answered them, saying, I baptize with water: but therestandeth one among you, whom ye know not; 

{1:27} He it is, who comingafter me is preferred before me, whose shoe's latchet I am not worthyto unloose. 

{1:28} These things were done in Bethabara beyond Jordan,where John was baptizing.   

{1:29} The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith,Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world. 

{1:30}This is he of whom I said, After me cometh a man which is preferredbefore me: for he was before me. 

{1:31} And I knew him not: but that heshould be made manifest to Israel, therefore am I come baptizing withwater. 

{1:32} And John bare record, saying, I saw the Spirit descendingfrom heaven like a dove, and it abode upon him. 

{1:33} And I knew himnot: but he that sent me to baptize with water, the same said unto me,Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him,the same is he which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost. 

{1:34} And I saw,and bare record that this is the Son of God.   

{1:35} Again the next day after John stood, and two of hisdisciples; 

{1:36} And looking upon Jesus as he walked, he saith, Beholdthe Lamb of God! 

{1:37} And the two disciples heard him speak, and theyfollowed Jesus. 

{1:38} Then Jesus turned, and saw them following, andsaith unto them, What seek ye? They said unto him, Rabbi, (which is tosay, being interpreted, Master,) where dwellest thou? 

{1:39} He saithunto them, Come and see. They came and saw where he dwelt, and abodewith him that day: for it was about the tenth hour. 

{1:40} One of thetwo which heard John [speak,] and followed him, was Andrew, SimonPeter's brother. 

{1:41} He first findeth his own brother Simon, andsaith unto him, We have found the Messias, which is, being interpreted,the Christ. 

{1:42} And he brought him to Jesus. And when Jesus beheldhim, he said, Thou art Simon the son of Jona: thou shalt be calledCephas, which is by interpretation, A stone.   

{1:43} The day following Jesus would go forth into Galilee, andfindeth Philip, and saith unto him, Follow me. 

{1:44} Now Philip was ofBethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter. 

{1:45} Philip findethNathanael, and saith unto him, We have found him, of whom Moses in thelaw, and the prophets, did write, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.

{1:46} And Nathanael said unto him, Can there any good thing come outof Nazareth? Philip saith unto him, Come and see. 

{1:47} Jesus sawNathanael coming to him, and saith of him, Behold an Israelite indeed,in whom is no guile! 

{1:48} Nathanael saith unto him, Whence knowestthou me? Jesus answered and said unto him, Before that Philip calledthee, when thou wast under the fig tree, I saw thee. 

{1:49} Nathanaelanswered and saith unto him, Rabbi, thou art the Son of God; thou artthe King of Israel. 

{1:50} Jesus answered and said unto him, Because Isaid unto thee, I saw thee under the fig tree, believest thou? thoushalt see greater things than these. 

{1:51} And he saith unto him,Verily, verily, I say unto you, Hereafter ye shall see heaven open, andthe angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man.   

{2:1} And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; andthe mother of Jesus was there: 

{2:2} And both Jesus was called, and hisdisciples, to the marriage. 

{2:3} And when they wanted wine, the motherof Jesus saith unto him, They have no wine. 

{2:4} Jesus saith unto her,Woman, what have I to do with thee? mine hour is not yet come. 

{2:5}His mother saith unto the servants, Whatsoever he saith unto you, do[it. ]

{2:6} And there were set there six waterpots of stone, after themanner of the purifying of the Jews, containing two or three firkinsapiece. 

{2:7} Jesus saith unto them, Fill the waterpots with water. Andthey filled them up to the brim. 

{2:8} And he saith unto them, Draw outnow, and bear unto the governor of the feast. And they bare [it. ]

{2:9}When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine,and knew not whence it was: (but the servants which drew the waterknew;) the governor of the feast called the bridegroom, 

{2:10} Andsaith unto him, Every man at the beginning doth set forth good wine;and when men have well drunk, then that which is worse: [but] thou hastkept the good wine until now. 

{2:11} This beginning of miracles didJesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested forth his glory; and hisdisciples believed on him.   

{2:12} After this he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother, andhis brethren, and his disciples: and they continued there not many days.   

{2:13} And the Jews' passover was at hand, and Jesus went up toJerusalem, 

{2:14} And found in the temple those that sold oxen andsheep and doves, and the changers of money sitting: 

{2:15} And when hehad made a scourge of small cords, he drove them all out of the temple,and the sheep, and the oxen; and poured out the changers' money, andoverthrew the tables; 

{2:16} And said unto them that sold doves, Takethese things hence; make not my Father's house an house of merchandise.

{2:17} And his disciples remembered that it was written, The zeal ofthine house hath eaten me up.   

{2:18} Then answered the Jews and said unto him, What sign shewestthou unto us, seeing that thou doest these things? 

{2:19} Jesusanswered and said unto them, Destroy this temple, and in three days Iwill raise it up. 

{2:20} Then said the Jews, Forty and six years wasthis temple in building, and wilt thou rear it up in three days? 

{2:21}But he spake of the temple of his body. 

{2:22} When therefore he wasrisen from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said thisunto them; and they believed the scripture, and the word which Jesushad said.   

{2:23} Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover, in the feast[day,] many believed in his name, when they saw the miracles which hedid. 

{2:24} But Jesus did not commit himself unto them, because he knewall [men, ]

{2:25} And needed not that any should testify of man: for heknew what was in man.   

{3:1} There was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler ofthe Jews: 

{3:2} The same came to Jesus by night, and said unto him,Rabbi, we know that thou art a teacher come from God: for no man can dothese miracles that thou doest, except God be with him. 

{3:3} Jesusanswered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except aman be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God. 

{3:4} Nicodemussaith unto him, How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter thesecond time into his mother's womb, and be born? 

{3:5} Jesus answered,Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and [of]the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. 

{3:6} That whichis born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit isspirit. 

{3:7} Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again.

{3:8} The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the soundthereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: sois every one that is born of the Spirit. 

{3:9} Nicodemus answered andsaid unto him, How can these things be? 

{3:10} Jesus answered and saidunto him, Art thou a master of Israel, and knowest not these things?

{3:11} Verily, verily, I say unto thee, We speak that we do know, andtestify that we have seen; and ye receive not our witness. 

{3:12} If Ihave told you earthly things, and ye believe not, how shall ye believe,if I tell you [of] heavenly things? 

{3:13} And no man hath ascended upto heaven, but he that came down from heaven, [even] the Son of manwhich is in heaven.   

{3:14} And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even somust the Son of man be lifted up: 

{3:15} That whosoever believeth inhim should not perish, but have eternal life.   

{3:16} For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begottenSon, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but haveeverlasting life. 

{3:17} For God sent not his Son into the world tocondemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.   

{3:18} He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he thatbelieveth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in thename of the only begotten Son of God. 

{3:19} And this is thecondemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darknessrather than light, because their deeds were evil. 

{3:20} For every onethat doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest hisdeeds should be reproved. 

{3:21} But he that doeth truth cometh to thelight, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought inGod.   

{3:22} After these things came Jesus and his disciples into the landof Judaea; and there he tarried with them, and baptized.   

{3:23} And John also was baptizing in Aenon near to Salim, becausethere was much water there: and they came, and were baptized. 

{3:24}For John was not yet cast into prison.   

{3:25} Then there arose a question between [some] of John'sdisciples and the Jews about purifying. 

{3:26} And they came unto John,and said unto him, Rabbi, he that was with thee beyond Jordan, to whomthou barest witness, behold, the same baptizeth, and all [men] come tohim. 

{3:27} John answered and said, A man can receive nothing, exceptit be given him from heaven. 

{3:28} Ye yourselves bear me witness, thatI said, I am not the Christ, but that I am sent before him. 

{3:29} Hethat hath the bride is the bridegroom: but the friend of thebridegroom, which standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth greatly becauseof the bridegroom's voice: this my joy therefore is fulfilled. 

{3:30}He must increase, but I [must] decrease. 

{3:31} He that cometh fromabove is above all: he that is of the earth is earthly, and speaketh ofthe earth: he that cometh from heaven is above all. 

{3:32} And what hehath seen and heard, that he testifieth; and no man receiveth histestimony. 

{3:33} He that hath received his testimony hath set to hisseal that God is true. 

{3:34} For he whom God hath sent speaketh thewords of God: for God giveth not the Spirit by measure [unto him.]

{3:35} The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into hishand. 

{3:36} He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and hethat believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of Godabideth on him.   

{4:1} When therefore the Lord knew how the Pharisees had heard thatJesus made and baptized more disciples than John, 

{4:2} (Though Jesushimself baptized not, but his disciples,) 

{4:3} He left Judaea, anddeparted again into Galilee. 

{4:4} And he must needs go throughSamaria. 

{4:5} Then cometh he to a city of Samaria, which is calledSychar, near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.

{4:6} Now Jacob's well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied with[his] journey, sat thus on the well: [and] it was about the sixth hour.

{4:7} There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jesus saith untoher, Give me to drink. 

{4:8} (For his disciples were gone away unto thecity to buy meat.) 

{4:9} Then saith the woman of Samaria unto him, Howis it that thou, being a Jew, askest drink of me, which am a woman ofSamaria? for the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans. 

{4:10}Jesus answered and said unto her, If thou knewest the gift of God, andwho it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest haveasked of him, and he would have given thee living water. 

{4:11} Thewoman saith unto him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the wellis deep: from whence then hast thou that living water? 

{4:12} Art thougreater than our father Jacob, which gave us the well, and drankthereof himself, and his children, and his cattle? 

{4:13} Jesusanswered and said unto her, Whosoever drinketh of this water shallthirst again: 

{4:14} But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shallgive him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shallbe in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life. 

{4:15}The woman saith unto him, Sir, give me this water, that I thirst not,neither come hither to draw. 

{4:16} Jesus saith unto her, Go, call thyhusband, and come hither. 

{4:17} The woman answered and said, I have nohusband. Jesus said unto her, Thou hast well said, I have no husband:

{4:18} For thou hast had five husbands; and he whom thou now hast isnot thy husband: in that saidst thou truly. 

{4:19} The woman saith untohim, Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet. 

{4:20} Our fathersworshipped in this mountain; and ye say, that in Jerusalem is the placewhere men ought to worship. 

{4:21} Jesus saith unto her, Woman, believeme, the hour cometh, when ye shall neither in this mountain, nor yet atJerusalem, worship the Father. 

{4:22} Ye worship ye know not what: weknow what we worship: for salvation is of the Jews. 

{4:23} But the hourcometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Fatherin spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship him.

{4:24} God [is] a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship [him]in spirit and in truth. 

{4:25} The woman saith unto him, I know thatMessias cometh, which is called Christ: when he is come, he will tellus all things. 

{4:26} Jesus saith unto her, I that speak unto thee am[he.]   

{4:27} And upon this came his disciples, and marvelled that hetalked with the woman: yet no man said, What seekest thou? or, Whytalkest thou with her? 

{4:28} The woman then left her waterpot, andwent her way into the city, and saith to the men, 

{4:29} Come, see aman, which told me all things that ever I did: is not this the Christ?

{4:30} Then they went out of the city, and came unto him.   

{4:31} In the mean while his disciples prayed him, saying, Master,eat. 

{4:32} But he said unto them, I have meat to eat that ye know notof. 

{4:33} Therefore said the disciples one to another, Hath any manbrought him [ought] to eat? 

{4:34} Jesus saith unto them, My meat is todo the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work. 

{4:35} Say notye, There are yet four months, and [then] cometh harvest? behold, I sayunto you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are whitealready to harvest. 

{4:36} And he that reapeth receiveth wages, andgathereth fruit unto life eternal: that both he that soweth and he thatreapeth may rejoice together. 

{4:37} And herein is that saying true,One soweth, and another reapeth. 

{4:38} I sent you to reap that whereonye bestowed no labour: other men laboured, and ye are entered intotheir labours.   

{4:39} And many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him forthe saying of the woman, which testified, He told me all that ever Idid. 

{4:40} So when the Samaritans were come unto him, they besoughthim that he would tarry with them: and he abode there two days. 

{4:41}And many more believed because of his own word; 

{4:42} And said untothe woman, Now we believe, not because of thy saying: for we have heard[him] ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Christ, the Saviourof the world.   

{4:43} Now after two days he departed thence, and went into Galilee.

{4:44} For Jesus himself testified, that a prophet hath no honour inhis own country. 

{4:45} Then when he was come into Galilee, theGalilaeans received him, having seen all the things that he did atJerusalem at the feast: for they also went unto the feast. 

{4:46} SoJesus came again into Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine.And there was a certain nobleman, whose son was sick at Capernaum.

{4:47} When he heard that Jesus was come out of Judaea into Galilee, hewent unto him, and besought him that he would come down, and heal hisson: for he was at the point of death. 

{4:48} Then said Jesus unto him,Except ye see signs and wonders, ye will not believe. 

{4:49} Thenobleman saith unto him, Sir, come down ere my child die. 

{4:50} Jesussaith unto him, Go thy way; thy son liveth. And the man believed theword that Jesus had spoken unto him, and he went his way. 

{4:51} And ashe was now going down, his servants met him, and told [him,] saying,Thy son liveth. 

{4:52} Then enquired he of them the hour when he beganto amend. And they said unto him, Yesterday at the seventh hour thefever left him. 

{4:53} So the father knew that [it was] at the samehour, in the which Jesus said unto him, Thy son liveth: and himselfbelieved, and his whole house. 

{4:54} This [is] again the secondmiracle [that] Jesus did, when he was come out of Judaea into Galilee.   

{5:1} After this there was a feast of the Jews; and Jesus went up toJerusalem. 

{5:2} Now there is at Jerusalem by the sheep [market] apool, which is called in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda, having fiveporches. 

{5:3} In these lay a great multitude of impotent folk, ofblind, halt, withered, waiting for the moving of the water. 

{5:4} Foran angel went down at a certain season into the pool, and troubled thewater: whosoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped inwas made whole of whatsoever disease he had. 

{5:5} And a certain manwas there, which had an infirmity thirty and eight years. 

{5:6} WhenJesus saw him lie, and knew that he had been now a long time [in thatcase,] he saith unto him, Wilt thou be made whole? 

{5:7} The impotentman answered him, Sir, I have no man, when the water is troubled, toput me into the pool: but while I am coming, another steppeth downbefore me. 

{5:8} Jesus saith unto him, Rise, take up thy bed, and walk.

{5:9} And immediately the man was made whole, and took up his bed, andwalked: and on the same day was the sabbath.   

{5:10} The Jews therefore said unto him that was cured, It is thesabbath day: it is not lawful for thee to carry [thy] bed. 

{5:11} Heanswered them, He that made me whole, the same said unto me, Take upthy bed, and walk. 

{5:12} Then asked they him, What man is that whichsaid unto thee, Take up thy bed, and walk? 

{5:13} And he that washealed wist not who it was: for Jesus had conveyed himself away, amultitude being in [that] place. 

{5:14} Afterward Jesus findeth him inthe temple, and said unto him, Behold, thou art made whole: sin nomore, lest a worse thing come unto thee. 

{5:15} The man departed, andtold the Jews that it was Jesus, which had made him whole. 

{5:16} Andtherefore did the Jews persecute Jesus, and sought to slay him, becausehe had done these things on the sabbath day.   

{5:17} But Jesus answered them, My Father worketh hitherto, and Iwork. 

{5:18} Therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because henot only had broken the sabbath, but said also that God was his Father,making himself equal with God. 

{5:19} Then answered Jesus and said untothem, Verily, verily, I say unto you, The Son can do nothing ofhimself, but what he seeth the Father do: for what things soever hedoeth, these also doeth the Son likewise. 

{5:20} For the Father loveththe Son, and sheweth him all things that himself doeth: and he willshew him greater works than these, that ye may marvel. 

{5:21} For asthe Father raiseth up the dead, and quickeneth [them;] even so the Sonquickeneth whom he will. 

{5:22} For the Father judgeth no man, but hathcommitted all judgment unto the Son: 

{5:23} That all [men] shouldhonour the Son, even as they honour the Father. He that honoureth notthe Son honoureth not the Father which hath sent him. 

{5:24} Verily,verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on himthat sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come intocondemnation; but is passed from death unto life. 

{5:25} Verily,verily, I say unto you, The hour is coming, and now is, when the deadshall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they that hear shall live.

{5:26} For as the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to theSon to have life in himself; 

{5:27} And hath given him authority toexecute judgment also, because he is the Son of man. 

{5:28} Marvel notat this: for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in thegraves shall hear his voice, 

{5:29} And shall come forth; they thathave done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have doneevil, unto the resurrection of damnation. 

{5:30} I can of mine own selfdo nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is just; because I seeknot mine own will, but the will of the Father which hath sent me.

{5:31} If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true.   

{5:32} There is another that beareth witness of me; and I know thatthe witness which he witnesseth of me is true. 

{5:33} Ye sent untoJohn, and he bare witness unto the truth. 

{5:34} But I receive nottestimony from man: but these things I say, that ye might be saved.

{5:35} He was a burning and a shining light: and ye were willing for aseason to rejoice in his light.   

{5:36} But I have greater witness than [that] of John: for the workswhich the Father hath given me to finish, the same works that I do,bear witness of me, that the Father hath sent me. 

{5:37} And the Fatherhimself, which hath sent me, hath borne witness of me. Ye have neitherheard his voice at any time, nor seen his shape. 

{5:38} And ye have nothis word abiding in you: for whom he hath sent, him ye believe not.   

{5:39} Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternallife: and they are they which testify of me. 

{5:40} And ye will notcome to me, that ye might have life. 

{5:41} I receive not honour frommen. 

{5:42} But I know you, that ye have not the love of God in you.

{5:43} I am come in my Father's name, and ye receive me not: if anothershall come in his own name, him ye will receive. 

{5:44} How can yebelieve, which receive honour one of another, and seek not the honourthat [cometh] from God only? 

{5:45} Do not think that I will accuse youto the Father: there is [one] that accuseth you, [even] Moses, in whomye trust. 

{5:46} For had ye believed Moses, ye would have believed me:for he wrote of me. 

{5:47} But if ye believe not his writings, howshall ye believe my words?   

{6:1} After these things Jesus went over the sea of Galilee, whichis [the sea] of Tiberias. 

{6:2} And a great multitude followed him,because they saw his miracles which he did on them that were diseased.

{6:3} And Jesus went up into a mountain, and there he sat with hisdisciples. 

{6:4} And the passover, a feast of the Jews, was nigh.   

{6:5} When Jesus then lifted up [his] eyes, and saw a great companycome unto him, he saith unto Philip, Whence shall we buy bread, thatthese may eat? 

{6:6} And this he said to prove him: for he himself knewwhat he would do. 

{6:7} Philip answered him, Two hundred pennyworth ofbread is not sufficient for them, that every one of them may take alittle. 

{6:8} One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother,saith unto him, 

{6:9} There is a lad here, which hath five barleyloaves, and two small fishes: but what are they among so many? 

{6:10}And Jesus said, Make the men sit down. Now there was much grass in theplace. So the men sat down, in number about five thousand. 

{6:11} AndJesus took the loaves; and when he had given thanks, he distributed tothe disciples, and the disciples to them that were set down; andlikewise of the fishes as much as they would. 

{6:12} When they werefilled, he said unto his disciples, Gather up the fragments thatremain, that nothing be lost. 

{6:13} Therefore they gathered [them]together, and filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the fivebarley loaves, which remained over and above unto them that had eaten.

{6:14} Then those men, when they had seen the miracle that Jesus did,said, This is of a truth that prophet that should come into the world.   

{6:15} When Jesus therefore perceived that they would come and takehim by force, to make him a king, he departed again into a mountainhimself alone. 

{6:16} And when even was [now] come, his disciples wentdown unto the sea, 

{6:17} And entered into a ship, and went over thesea toward Capernaum. And it was now dark, and Jesus was not come tothem. 

{6:18} And the sea arose by reason of a great wind that blew.

{6:19} So when they had rowed about five and twenty or thirty furlongs,they see Jesus walking on the sea, and drawing nigh unto the ship: andthey were afraid. 

{6:20} But he saith unto them, It is I; be notafraid. 

{6:21} Then they willingly received him into the ship: andimmediately the ship was at the land whither they went.   

{6:22} The day following, when the people which stood on the otherside of the sea saw that there was none other boat there, save that onewhereinto his disciples were entered, and that Jesus went not with hisdisciples into the boat, but [that] his disciples were gone away alone;

{6:23} (Howbeit there came other boats from Tiberias nigh unto theplace where they did eat bread, after that the Lord had given thanks:)

{6:24} When the people therefore saw that Jesus was not there, neitherhis disciples, they also took shipping, and came to Capernaum, seekingfor Jesus. 

{6:25} And when they had found him on the other side of thesea, they said unto him, Rabbi, when camest thou hither? 

{6:26} Jesusanswered them and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Ye seek me, notbecause ye saw the miracles, but because ye did eat of the loaves, andwere filled. 

{6:27} Labour not for the meat which perisheth, but forthat meat which endureth unto everlasting life, which the Son of manshall give unto you: for him hath God the Father sealed. 

{6:28} Thensaid they unto him, What shall we do, that we might work the works ofGod? 

{6:29} Jesus answered and said unto them, This is the work of God,that ye believe on him whom he hath sent. 

{6:30} They said thereforeunto him, What sign shewest thou then, that we may see, and believethee? what dost thou work? 

{6:31} Our fathers did eat manna in thedesert; as it is written, He gave them bread from heaven to eat. 

{6:32}Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Moses gaveyou not that bread from heaven; but my Father giveth you the true breadfrom heaven. 

{6:33} For the bread of God is he which cometh down fromheaven, and giveth life unto the world. 

{6:34} Then said they unto him,Lord, evermore give us this bread. 

{6:35} And Jesus said unto them, Iam the bread of life: he that cometh to me shall never hunger; and hethat believeth on me shall never thirst. 

{6:36} But I said unto you,That ye also have seen me, and believe not. 

{6:37} All that the Fathergiveth me shall come to me; and him that cometh to me I will in no wisecast out. 

{6:38} For I came down from heaven, not to do mine own will,but the will of him that sent me. 

{6:39} And this is the Father's willwhich hath sent me, that of all which he hath given me I should losenothing, but should raise it up again at the last day. 

{6:40} And thisis the will of him that sent me, that every one which seeth the Son,and believeth on him, may have everlasting life: and I will raise himup at the last day. 

{6:41} The Jews then murmured at him, because hesaid, I am the bread which came down from heaven. 

{6:42} And they said,Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know?how is it then that he saith, I came down from heaven? 

{6:43} Jesustherefore answered and said unto them, Murmur not among yourselves.

{6:44} No man can come to me, except the Father which hath sent me drawhim: and I will raise him up at the last day. 

{6:45} It is written inthe prophets, And they shall be all taught of God. Every man thereforethat hath heard, and hath learned of the Father, cometh unto me. 

{6:46}Not that any man hath seen the Father, save he which is of God, he hathseen the Father. 

{6:47} Verily, verily, I say unto you, He thatbelieveth on me hath everlasting life. 

{6:48} I am that bread of life.

{6:49} Your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness, and are dead.

{6:50} This is the bread which cometh down from heaven, that a man mayeat thereof, and not die. 

{6:51} I am the living bread which came downfrom heaven: if any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever: andthe bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the lifeof the world. 

{6:52} The Jews therefore strove among themselves,saying, How can this man give us [his] flesh to eat? 

{6:53} Then Jesussaid unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except ye eat the fleshof the Son of man, and drink his blood, ye have no life in you. 

{6:54}Whoso eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life; and Iwill raise him up at the last day. 

{6:55} For my flesh is meat indeed,and my blood is drink indeed. 

{6:56} He that eateth my flesh, anddrinketh my blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him. 

{6:57} As the livingFather hath sent me, and I live by the Father: so he that eateth me,even he shall live by me. 

{6:58} This is that bread which came downfrom heaven: not as your fathers did eat manna, and are dead: he thateateth of this bread shall live for ever. 

{6:59} These things said hein the synagogue, as he taught in Capernaum. 

{6:60} Many therefore ofhis disciples, when they had heard [this,] said, This is an hardsaying; who can hear it? 

{6:61} When Jesus knew in himself that hisdisciples murmured at it, he said unto them, Doth this offend you?

{6:62} [What] and if ye shall see the Son of man ascend up where he wasbefore? 

{6:63} It is the spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profitethnothing: the words that I speak unto you, [they] are spirit, and [they]are life. 

{6:64} But there are some of you that believe not. For Jesusknew from the beginning who they were that believed not, and who shouldbetray him. 

{6:65} And he said, Therefore said I unto you, that no mancan come unto me, except it were given unto him of my Father.   

{6:66} From that [time] many of his disciples went back, and walkedno more with him. 

{6:67} Then said Jesus unto the twelve, Will ye alsogo away? 

{6:68} Then Simon Peter answered him, Lord, to whom shall wego? thou hast the words of eternal life. 

{6:69} And we believe and aresure that thou art that Christ, the Son of the living God. 

{6:70} Jesusanswered them, Have not I chosen you twelve, and one of you is a devil?

{6:71} He spake of Judas Iscariot [the son] of Simon: for he it wasthat should betray him, being one of the twelve.   

{7:1} After these things Jesus walked in Galilee: for he would notwalk in Jewry, because the Jews sought to kill him. 

{7:2} Now the Jews'feast of tabernacles was at hand. 

{7:3} His brethren therefore saidunto him, Depart hence, and go into Judaea, that thy disciples also maysee the works that thou doest. 

{7:4} For [there is] no man [that] doethany thing in secret, and he himself seeketh to be known openly. If thoudo these things, shew thyself to the world. 

{7:5} For neither did hisbrethren believe in him. 

{7:6} Then Jesus said unto them, My time isnot yet come: but your time is alway ready. 

{7:7} The world cannot hateyou; but me it hateth, because I testify of it, that the works thereofare evil. 

{7:8} Go ye up unto this feast: I go not up yet unto thisfeast; for my time is not yet full come. 

{7:9} When he had said thesewords unto them, he abode [still] in Galilee.   

{7:10} But when his brethren were gone up, then went he also up untothe feast, not openly, but as it were in secret. 

{7:11} Then the Jewssought him at the feast, and said, Where is he? 

{7:12} And there wasmuch murmuring among the people concerning him: for some said, He is agood man: others said, Nay; but he deceiveth the people. 

{7:13} Howbeitno man spake openly of him for fear of the Jews.   

{7:14} Now about the midst of the feast Jesus went up into thetemple, and taught. 

{7:15} And the Jews marvelled, saying, How knoweththis man letters, having never learned? 

{7:16} Jesus answered them, andsaid, My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me. 

{7:17} If any manwill do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God,or [whether] I speak of myself. 

{7:18} He that speaketh of himselfseeketh his own glory: but he that seeketh his glory that sent him, thesame is true, and no unrighteousness is in him. 

{7:19} Did not Mosesgive you the law, and [yet] none of you keepeth the law? Why go yeabout to kill me? 

{7:20} The people answered and said, Thou hast adevil: who goeth about to kill thee? 

{7:21} Jesus answered and saidunto them, I have done one work, and ye all marvel. 

{7:22} Mosestherefore gave unto you circumcision; (not because it is of Moses, butof the fathers;) and ye on the sabbath day circumcise a man. 

{7:23} Ifa man on the sabbath day receive circumcision, that the law of Mosesshould not be broken; are ye angry at me, because I have made a manevery whit whole on the sabbath day? 

{7:24} Judge not according to theappearance, but judge righteous judgment. 

{7:25} Then said some of themof Jerusalem, Is not this he, whom they seek to kill? 

{7:26} But, lo,he speaketh boldly, and they say nothing unto him. Do the rulers knowindeed that this is the very Christ? 

{7:27} Howbeit we know this manwhence he is: but when Christ cometh, no man knoweth whence he is.

{7:28} Then cried Jesus in the temple as he taught, saying, Ye bothknow me, and ye know whence I am: and I am not come of myself, but hethat sent me is true, whom ye know not. 

{7:29} But I know him: for I amfrom him, and he hath sent me. 

{7:30} Then they sought to take him: butno man laid hands on him, because his hour was not yet come. 

{7:31} Andmany of the people believed on him, and said, When Christ cometh, willhe do more miracles than these which this [man] hath done?   

{7:32} The Pharisees heard that the people murmured such thingsconcerning him; and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officersto take him. 

{7:33} Then said Jesus unto them, Yet a little while am Iwith you, and [then] I go unto him that sent me. 

{7:34} Ye shall seekme, and shall not find [me:] and where I am, [thither] ye cannot come.

{7:35} Then said the Jews among themselves, Whither will he go, that weshall not find him? will he go unto the dispersed among the Gentiles,and teach the Gentiles? 

{7:36} What [manner of] saying is this that hesaid, Ye shall seek me, and shall not find [me:] and where I am,[thither] ye cannot come? 

{7:37} In the last day, that great [day] ofthe feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let himcome unto me, and drink. 

{7:38} He that believeth on me, as thescripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of livingwater. 

{7:39} (But this spake he of the Spirit, which they that believeon him should receive: for the Holy Ghost was not yet [given;] becausethat Jesus was not yet glorified.)   

{7:40} Many of the people therefore, when they heard this saying,said, Of a truth this is the Prophet. 

{7:41} Others said, This is theChrist. But some said, Shall Christ come out of Galilee? 

{7:42} Hathnot the scripture said, That Christ cometh of the seed of David, andout of the town of Bethlehem, where David was? 

{7:43} So there was adivision among the people because of him. 

{7:44} And some of them wouldhave taken him; but no man laid hands on him.   

{7:45} Then came the officers to the chief priests and Pharisees;and they said unto them, Why have ye not brought him? 

{7:46} Theofficers answered, Never man spake like this man. 

{7:47} Then answeredthem the Pharisees, Are ye also deceived? 

{7:48} Have any of the rulersor of the Pharisees believed on him? 

{7:49} But this people who knowethnot the law are cursed. 

{7:50} Nicodemus saith unto them, (he that cameto Jesus by night, being one of them,) 

{7:51} Doth our law judge [any]man, before it hear him, and know what he doeth? 

{7:52} They answeredand said unto him, Art thou also of Galilee? Search, and look: for outof Galilee ariseth no prophet. 

{7:53} And every man went unto his ownhouse.   

{8:1} Jesus went unto the mount of Olives. 

{8:2} And early in themorning he came again into the temple, and all the people came untohim; and he sat down, and taught them. 

{8:3} And the scribes andPharisees brought unto him a woman taken in adultery; and when they hadset her in the midst, 

{8:4} They say unto him, Master, this woman wastaken in adultery, in the very act. 

{8:5} Now Moses in the lawcommanded us, that such should be stoned: but what sayest thou? 

{8:6}This they said, tempting him, that they might have to accuse him. ButJesus stooped down, and with [his] finger wrote on the ground, [asthough he heard them not. ]

{8:7} So when they continued asking him, helifted up himself, and said unto them, He that is without sin amongyou, let him first cast a stone at her. 

{8:8} And again he stoopeddown, and wrote on the ground. 

{8:9} And they which heard [it,] beingconvicted by [their own] conscience, went out one by one, beginning atthe eldest, [even] unto the last: and Jesus was left alone, and thewoman standing in the midst. 

{8:10} When Jesus had lifted up himself,and saw none but the woman, he said unto her, Woman, where are thosethine accusers? hath no man condemned thee? 

{8:11} She said, No man,Lord. And Jesus said unto her, Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sinno more.   

{8:12} Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light ofthe world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shallhave the light of life. 

{8:13} The Pharisees therefore said unto him,Thou bearest record of thyself; thy record is not true. 

{8:14} Jesusanswered and said unto them, Though I bear record of myself, [yet] myrecord is true: for I know whence I came, and whither I go; but yecannot tell whence I come, and whither I go. 

{8:15} Ye judge after theflesh; I judge no man. 

{8:16} And yet if I judge, my judgment is true:for I am not alone, but I and the Father that sent me. 

{8:17} It isalso written in your law, that the testimony of two men is true. 

{8:18}I am one that bear witness of myself, and the Father that sent mebeareth witness of me. 

{8:19} Then said they unto him, Where is thyFather? Jesus answered, Ye neither know me, nor my Father: if ye hadknown me, ye should have known my Father also. 

{8:20} These words spakeJesus in the treasury, as he taught in the temple: and no man laidhands on him; for his hour was not yet come. 

{8:21} Then said Jesusagain unto them, I go my way, and ye shall seek me, and shall die inyour sins: whither I go, ye cannot come. 

{8:22} Then said the Jews,Will he kill himself? because he saith, Whither I go, ye cannot come.

{8:23} And he said unto them, Ye are from beneath; I am from above: yeare of this world; I am not of this world. 

{8:24} I said therefore untoyou, that ye shall die in your sins: for if ye believe not that I am[he,] ye shall die in your sins. 

{8:25} Then said they unto him, Whoart thou? And Jesus saith unto them, Even [the same] that I said untoyou from the beginning. 

{8:26} I have many things to say and to judgeof you: but he that sent me is true; and I speak to the world thosethings which I have heard of him. 

{8:27} They understood not that hespake to them of the Father. 

{8:28} Then said Jesus unto them, When yehave lifted up the Son of man, then shall ye know that I am [he,] and[that] I do nothing of myself; but as my Father hath taught me, I speakthese things. 

{8:29} And he that sent me is with me: the Father hathnot left me alone; for I do always those things that please him. 

{8:30}As he spake these words, many believed on him. 

{8:31} Then said Jesusto those Jews which believed on him, If ye continue in my word, [then]are ye my disciples indeed; 

{8:32} And ye shall know the truth, and thetruth shall make you free.   

{8:33} They answered him, We be Abraham's seed, and were never inbondage to any man: how sayest thou, Ye shall be made free? 

{8:34}Jesus answered them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whosoevercommitteth sin is the servant of sin. 

{8:35} And the servant abidethnot in the house for ever: [but] the Son abideth ever. 

{8:36} If theSon therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed. 

{8:37} Iknow that ye are Abraham's seed; but ye seek to kill me, because myword hath no place in you. 

{8:38} I speak that which I have seen withmy Father: and ye do that which ye have seen with your father. 

{8:39}They answered and said unto him, Abraham is our father. Jesus saithunto them, If ye were Abraham's children, ye would do the works ofAbraham. 

{8:40} But now ye seek to kill me, a man that hath told youthe truth, which I have heard of God: this did not Abraham. 

{8:41} Yedo the deeds of your father. Then said they to him, We be not born offornication; we have one Father, [even] God. 

{8:42} Jesus said untothem, If God were your Father, ye would love me: for I proceeded forthand came from God; neither came I of myself, but he sent me. 

{8:43} Whydo ye not understand my speech? [even] because ye cannot hear my word.

{8:44} Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of [your] fatherye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in thetruth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, hespeaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it. 

{8:45} Andbecause I tell [you] the truth, ye believe me not. 

{8:46} Which of youconvinceth me of sin? And if I say the truth, why do ye not believe me?

{8:47} He that is of God heareth God's words: ye therefore hear [them]not, because ye are not of God. 

{8:48} Then answered the Jews, and saidunto him, Say we not well that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a devil?

{8:49} Jesus answered, I have not a devil; but I honour my Father, andye do dishonour me. 

{8:50} And I seek not mine own glory: there is onethat seeketh and judgeth. 

{8:51} Verily, verily, I say unto you, If aman keep my saying, he shall never see death. 

{8:52} Then said the Jewsunto him, Now we know that thou hast a devil. Abraham is dead, and theprophets; and thou sayest, If a man keep my saying, he shall nevertaste of death. 

{8:53} Art thou greater than our father Abraham, whichis dead? and the prophets are dead: whom makest thou thyself? 

{8:54}Jesus answered, If I honour myself, my honour is nothing: it is myFather that honoureth me; of whom ye say, that he is your God: 

{8:55}Yet ye have not known him; but I know him: and if I should say, I knowhim not, I shall be a liar like unto you: but I know him, and keep hissaying. 

{8:56} Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day: and he saw[it,] and was glad. 

{8:57} Then said the Jews unto him, Thou art notyet fifty years old, and hast thou seen Abraham? 

{8:58} Jesus said untothem, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was, I am. 

{8:59}Then took they up stones to cast at him: but Jesus hid himself, andwent out of the temple, going through the midst of them, and so passedby.   

{9:1} And as [Jesus] passed by, he saw a man which was blind from[his] birth. 

{9:2} And his disciples asked him, saying, Master, who didsin, this man, or his parents, that he was born blind? 

{9:3} Jesusanswered, Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents: but that theworks of God should be made manifest in him. 

{9:4} I must work theworks of him that sent me, while it is day: the night cometh, when noman can work. 

{9:5} As long as I am in the world, I am the light of theworld. 

{9:6} When he had thus spoken, he spat on the ground, and madeclay of the spittle, and he anointed the eyes of the blind man with theclay, 

{9:7} And said unto him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam, (whichis by interpretation, Sent.) He went his way therefore, and washed, andcame seeing.   

{9:8} The neighbours therefore, and they which before had seen himthat he was blind, said, Is not this he that sat and begged? 

{9:9} Somesaid, This is he: others [said,] He is like him: [but] he said, I am[he. ]

{9:10} Therefore said they unto him, How were thine eyes opened?

{9:11} He answered and said, A man that is called Jesus made clay, andanointed mine eyes, and said unto me, Go to the pool of Siloam, andwash: and I went and washed, and I received sight. 

{9:12} Then saidthey unto him, Where is he? He said, I know not.   

{9:13} They brought to the Pharisees him that aforetime was blind.

{9:14} And it was the sabbath day when Jesus made the clay, and openedhis eyes. 

{9:15} Then again the Pharisees also asked him how he hadreceived his sight. He said unto them, He put clay upon mine eyes, andI washed, and do see. 

{9:16} Therefore said some of the Pharisees, Thisman is not of God, because he keepeth not the sabbath day. Others said,How can a man that is a sinner do such miracles? And there was adivision among them. 

{9:17} They say unto the blind man again, Whatsayest thou of him, that he hath opened thine eyes? He said, He is aprophet. 

{9:18} But the Jews did not believe concerning him, that hehad been blind, and received his sight, until they called the parentsof him that had received his sight. 

{9:19} And they asked them, saying,Is this your son, who ye say was born blind? how then doth he now see?

{9:20} His parents answered them and said, We know that this is ourson, and that he was born blind: 

{9:21} But by what means he now seeth,we know not; or who hath opened his eyes, we know not: he is of age;ask him: he shall speak for himself. 

{9:22} These [words] spake hisparents, because they feared the Jews: for the Jews had agreed already,that if any man did confess that he was Christ, he should be put out ofthe synagogue. 

{9:23} Therefore said his parents, He is of age; askhim. 

{9:24} Then again called they the man that was blind, and saidunto him, Give God the praise: we know that this man is a sinner.

{9:25} He answered and said, Whether he be a sinner [or no,] I knownot: one thing I know, that, whereas I was blind, now I see. 

{9:26}Then said they to him again, What did he to thee? how opened he thineeyes? 

{9:27} He answered them, I have told you already, and ye did nothear: wherefore would ye hear [it] again? will ye also be hisdisciples? 

{9:28} Then they reviled him, and said, Thou art hisdisciple; but we are Moses' disciples. 

{9:29} We know that God spakeunto Moses: [as for] this [fellow,] we know not from whence he is.

{9:30} The man answered and said unto them, Why herein is a marvellousthing, that ye know not from whence he is, and [yet] he hath openedmine eyes. 

{9:31} Now we know that God heareth not sinners: but if anyman be a worshipper of God, and doeth his will, him he heareth. 

{9:32}Since the world began was it not heard that any man opened the eyes ofone that was born blind. 

{9:33} If this man were not of God, he coulddo nothing. 

{9:34} They answered and said unto him, Thou wastaltogether born in sins, and dost thou teach us? And they cast him out.

{9:35} Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and when he had foundhim, he said unto him, Dost thou believe on the Son of God? 

{9:36} Heanswered and said, Who is he, Lord, that I might believe on him? 

{9:37}And Jesus said unto him, Thou hast both seen him, and it is he thattalketh with thee. 

{9:38} And he said, Lord, I believe. And heworshipped him.   

{9:39} And Jesus said, For judgment I am come into this world, thatthey which see not might see; and that they which see might be madeblind. 

{9:40} And [some] of the Pharisees which were with him heardthese words, and said unto him, Are we blind also? 

{9:41} Jesus saidunto them, If ye were blind, ye should have no sin: but now ye say, Wesee; therefore your sin remaineth.   

{10:1} Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that entereth not by thedoor into the sheepfold, but climbeth up some other way, the same is athief and a robber. 

{10:2} But he that entereth in by the door is theshepherd of the sheep. 

{10:3} To him the porter openeth; and the sheephear his voice: and he calleth his own sheep by name, and leadeth themout. 

{10:4} And when he putteth forth his own sheep, he goeth beforethem, and the sheep follow him: for they know his voice. 

{10:5} And astranger will they not follow, but will flee from him: for they knownot the voice of strangers. 

{10:6} This parable spake Jesus unto them:but they understood not what things they were which he spake unto them.

{10:7} Then said Jesus unto them again, Verily, verily, I say unto you,I am the door of the sheep. 

{10:8} All that ever came before me arethieves and robbers: but the sheep did not hear them. 

{10:9} I am thedoor: by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in andout, and find pasture. 

{10:10} The thief cometh not, but for to steal,and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they might have life, andthat they might have [it] more abundantly. 

{10:11} I am the goodshepherd: the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep. 

{10:12} Buthe that is an hireling, and not the shepherd, whose own the sheep arenot, seeth the wolf coming, and leaveth the sheep, and fleeth: and thewolf catcheth them, and scattereth the sheep. 

{10:13} The hirelingfleeth, because he is an hireling, and careth not for the sheep.

{10:14} I am the good shepherd, and know my [sheep,] and am known ofmine. 

{10:15} As the Father knoweth me, even so know I the Father: andI lay down my life for the sheep. 

{10:16} And other sheep I have, whichare not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear myvoice; and there shall be one fold, [and] one shepherd. 

{10:17}Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my life, that Imight take it again. 

{10:18} No man taketh it from me, but I lay itdown of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to takeit again. This commandment have I received of my Father.   

{10:19} There was a division therefore again among the Jews forthese sayings. 

{10:20} And many of them said, He hath a devil, and ismad; why hear ye him? 

{10:21} Others said, These are not the words ofhim that hath a devil. Can a devil open the eyes of the blind?   

{10:22} And it was at Jerusalem the feast of the dedication, and itwas winter. 

{10:23} And Jesus walked in the temple in Solomon's porch.

{10:24} Then came the Jews round about him, and said unto him, How longdost thou make us to doubt? If thou be the Christ, tell us plainly.

{10:25} Jesus answered them, I told you, and ye believed not: the worksthat I do in my Father's name, they bear witness of me. 

{10:26} But yebelieve not, because ye are not of my sheep, as I said unto you.

{10:27} My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me:

{10:28} And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish,neither shall any [man] pluck them out of my hand. 

{10:29} My Father,which gave [them] me, is greater than all; and no [man] is able topluck [them] out of my Father's hand. 

{10:30} I and [my] Father areone. 

{10:31} Then the Jews took up stones again to stone him. 

{10:32}Jesus answered them, Many good works have I shewed you from my Father;for which of those works do ye stone me? 

{10:33} The Jews answered him,saying, For a good work we stone thee not; but for blasphemy; andbecause that thou, being a man, makest thyself God. 

{10:34} Jesusanswered them, Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye are gods?

{10:35} If he called them gods, unto whom the word of God came, and thescripture cannot be broken; 

{10:36} Say ye of him, whom the Father hathsanctified, and sent into the world, Thou blasphemest; because I said,I am the Son of God? 

{10:37} If I do not the works of my Father,believe me not. 

{10:38} But if I do, though ye believe not me, believethe works: that ye may know, and believe, that the Father is in me, andI in him. 

{10:39} Therefore they sought again to take him: but heescaped out of their hand, 

{10:40} And went away again beyond Jordaninto the place where John at first baptized; and there he abode.

{10:41} And many resorted unto him, and said, John did no miracle: butall things that John spake of this man were true. 

{10:42} And manybelieved on him there.   

{11:1} Now a certain [man] was sick, [named] Lazarus, of Bethany,the town of Mary and her sister Martha. 

{11:2} (It was [that] Marywhich anointed the Lord with ointment, and wiped his feet with herhair, whose brother Lazarus was sick.) 

{11:3} Therefore his sisterssent unto him, saying, Lord, behold, he whom thou lovest is sick.

{11:4} When Jesus heard [that,] he said, This sickness is not untodeath, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God might be glorifiedthereby. 

{11:5} Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus.

{11:6} When he had heard therefore that he was sick, he abode two daysstill in the same place where he was. 

{11:7} Then after that saith heto [his] disciples, Let us go into Judaea again. 

{11:8} [His] disciplessay unto him, Master, the Jews of late sought to stone thee; and goestthou thither again? 

{11:9} Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hoursin the day? If any man walk in the day, he stumbleth not, because heseeth the light of this world. 

{11:10} But if a man walk in the night,he stumbleth, because there is no light in him. 

{11:11} These thingssaid he: and after that he saith unto them, Our friend Lazarussleepeth; but I go, that I may awake him out of sleep. 

{11:12} Thensaid his disciples, Lord, if he sleep, he shall do well. 

{11:13}Howbeit Jesus spake of his death: but they thought that he had spokenof taking of rest in sleep. 

{11:14} Then said Jesus unto them plainly,Lazarus is dead. 

{11:15} And I am glad for your sakes that I was notthere, to the intent ye may believe; nevertheless let us go unto him.

{11:16} Then said Thomas, which is called Didymus, unto hisfellowdisciples, Let us also go, that we may die with him. 

{11:17} Thenwhen Jesus came, he found that he had [lain] in the grave four daysalready. 

{11:18} Now Bethany was nigh unto Jerusalem, about fifteenfurlongs off: 

{11:19} And many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary, tocomfort them concerning their brother. 

{11:20} Then Martha, as soon asshe heard that Jesus was coming, went and met him: but Mary sat [still]in the house. 

{11:21} Then said Martha unto Jesus, Lord, if thou hadstbeen here, my brother had not died. 

{11:22} But I know, that even now,whatsoever thou wilt ask of God, God will give [it] thee. 

{11:23} Jesussaith unto her, Thy brother shall rise again. 

{11:24} Martha saith untohim, I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the lastday. 

{11:25} Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life:he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live:

{11:26} And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die.Believest thou this? 

{11:27} She saith unto him, Yea, Lord: I believethat thou art the Christ, the Son of God, which should come into theworld. 

{11:28} And when she had so said, she went her way, and calledMary her sister secretly, saying, The Master is come, and calleth forthee. 

{11:29} As soon as she heard [that,] she arose quickly, and cameunto him. 

{11:30} Now Jesus was not yet come into the town, but was inthat place where Martha met him. 

{11:31} The Jews then which were withher in the house, and comforted her, when they saw Mary, that she roseup hastily and went out, followed her, saying, She goeth unto the graveto weep there. 

{11:32} Then when Mary was come where Jesus was, and sawhim, she fell down at his feet, saying unto him, Lord, if thou hadstbeen here, my brother had not died. 

{11:33} When Jesus therefore sawher weeping, and the Jews also weeping which came with her, he groanedin the spirit, and was troubled, 

{11:34} And said, Where have ye laidhim? They said unto him, Lord, come and see. 

{11:35} Jesus wept.

{11:36} Then said the Jews, Behold how he loved him! 

{11:37} And someof them said, Could not this man, which opened the eyes of the blind,have caused that even this man should not have died? 

{11:38} Jesustherefore again groaning in himself cometh to the grave. It was a cave,and a stone lay upon it. 

{11:39} Jesus said, Take ye away the stone.Martha, the sister of him that was dead, saith unto him, Lord, by thistime he stinketh: for he hath been [dead] four days. 

{11:40} Jesussaith unto her, Said I not unto thee, that, if thou wouldest believe,thou shouldest see the glory of God? 

{11:41} Then they took away thestone [from the place] where the dead was laid. And Jesus lifted up[his] eyes, and said, Father, I thank thee that thou hast heard me.

{11:42} And I knew that thou hearest me always: but because of thepeople which stand by I said [it,] that they may believe that thou hastsent me. 

{11:43} And when he thus had spoken, he cried with a loudvoice, Lazarus, come forth. 

{11:44} And he that was dead came forth,bound hand and foot with graveclothes: and his face was bound aboutwith a napkin. Jesus saith unto them, Loose him, and let him go.

{11:45} Then many of the Jews which came to Mary, and had seen thethings which Jesus did, believed on him. 

{11:46} But some of them wenttheir ways to the Pharisees, and told them what things Jesus had done.   

{11:47} Then gathered the chief priests and the Pharisees a council,and said, What do we? for this man doeth many miracles. 

{11:48} If welet him thus alone, all [men] will believe on him: and the Romans shallcome and take away both our place and nation. 

{11:49} And one of them,[named] Caiaphas, being the high priest that same year, said unto them,Ye know nothing at all, 

{11:50} Nor consider that it is expedient forus, that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nationperish not. 

{11:51} And this spake he not of himself: but being highpriest that year, he prophesied that Jesus should die for that nation;

{11:52} And not for that nation only, but that also he should gathertogether in one the children of God that were scattered abroad. 

{11:53}Then from that day forth they took counsel together for to put him todeath. 

{11:54} Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews;but went thence unto a country near to the wilderness, into a citycalled Ephraim, and there continued with his disciples.   

{11:55} And the Jews' passover was nigh at hand: and many went outof the country up to Jerusalem before the passover, to purifythemselves. 

{11:56} Then sought they for Jesus, and spake amongthemselves, as they stood in the temple, What think ye, that he willnot come to the feast? 

{11:57} Now both the chief priests and thePharisees had given a commandment, that, if any man knew where he were,he should shew [it,] that they might take him.   

{12:1} Then Jesus six days before the passover came to Bethany,where Lazarus was which had been dead, whom he raised from the dead.

{12:2} There they made him a supper; and Martha served: but Lazarus wasone of them that sat at the table with him. 

{12:3} Then took Mary apound of ointment of spikenard, very costly, and anointed the feet ofJesus, and wiped his feet with her hair: and the house was filled withthe odour of the ointment. 

{12:4} Then saith one of his disciples,Judas Iscariot, Simon's [son,] which should betray him, 

{12:5} Why wasnot this ointment sold for three hundred pence, and given to the poor?

{12:6} This he said, not that he cared for the poor; but because he wasa thief, and had the bag, and bare what was put therein. 

{12:7} Thensaid Jesus, Let her alone: against the day of my burying hath she keptthis. 

{12:8} For the poor always ye have with you; but me ye have notalways. 

{12:9} Much people of the Jews therefore knew that he wasthere: and they came not for Jesus' sake only, but that they might seeLazarus also, whom he had raised from the dead.   

{12:10} But the chief priests consulted that they might put Lazarusalso to death; 

{12:11} Because that by reason of him many of the Jewswent away, and believed on Jesus.   

{12:12} On the next day much people that were come to the feast,when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem, 

{12:13} Tookbranches of palm trees, and went forth to meet him, and cried, Hosanna:Blessed [is] the King of Israel that cometh in the name of the Lord.

{12:14} And Jesus, when he had found a young ass, sat thereon; as it iswritten, 

{12:15} Fear not, daughter of Sion: behold, thy King cometh,sitting on an ass's colt. 

{12:16} These things understood not hisdisciples at the first: but when Jesus was glorified, then rememberedthey that these things were written of him, and [that] they had donethese things unto him. 

{12:17} The people therefore that was with himwhen he called Lazarus out of his grave, and raised him from the dead,bare record. 

{12:18} For this cause the people also met him, for thatthey heard that he had done this miracle. 

{12:19} The Phariseestherefore said among themselves, Perceive ye how ye prevail nothing?behold, the world is gone after him.   

{12:20} And there were certain Greeks among them that came up toworship at the feast: 

{12:21} The same came therefore to Philip, whichwas of Bethsaida of Galilee, and desired him, saying, Sir, we would seeJesus. 

{12:22} Philip cometh and telleth Andrew: and again Andrew andPhilip tell Jesus.   

{12:23} And Jesus answered them, saying, The hour is come, that theSon of man should be glorified. 

{12:24} Verily, verily, I say unto you,Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone:but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit. 

{12:25} He that loveth hislife shall lose it; and he that hateth his life in this world shallkeep it unto life eternal. 

{12:26} If any man serve me, let him followme; and where I am, there shall also my servant be: if any man serveme, him will [my] Father honour. 

{12:27} Now is my soul troubled; andwhat shall I say? Father, save me from this hour: but for this causecame I unto this hour. 

{12:28} Father, glorify thy name. Then camethere a voice from heaven, [saying,] I have both glorified [it,] andwill glorify [it] again. 

{12:29} The people therefore, that stood by,and heard [it,] said that it thundered: others said, An angel spake tohim. 

{12:30} Jesus answered and said, This voice came not because ofme, but for your sakes. 

{12:31} Now is the judgment of this world: nowshall the prince of this world be cast out. 

{12:32} And I, if I belifted up from the earth, will draw all [men] unto me. 

{12:33} This hesaid, signifying what death he should die. 

{12:34} The people answeredhim, We have heard out of the law that Christ abideth for ever: and howsayest thou, The Son of man must be lifted up? who is this Son of man?

{12:35} Then Jesus said unto them, Yet a little while is the light withyou. Walk while ye have the light, lest darkness come upon you: for hethat walketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth. 

{12:36} While yehave light, believe in the light, that ye may be the children of light.These things spake Jesus, and departed, and did hide himself from them.   

{12:37} But though he had done so many miracles before them, yetthey believed not on him: 

{12:38} That the saying of Esaias the prophetmight be fulfilled, which he spake, Lord, who hath believed our report?and to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed? 

{12:39} Thereforethey could not believe, because that Esaias said again, 

{12:40} He hathblinded their eyes, and hardened their heart; that they should not seewith [their] eyes, nor understand with [their] heart, and be converted,and I should heal them. 

{12:41} These things said Esaias, when he sawhis glory, and spake of him.   

{12:42} Nevertheless among the chief rulers also many believed onhim; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess [him,] lest theyshould be put out of the synagogue: 

{12:43} For they loved the praiseof men more than the praise of God.   

{12:44} Jesus cried and said, He that believeth on me, believeth noton me, but on him that sent me. 

{12:45} And he that seeth me seeth himthat sent me. 

{12:46} I am come a light into the world, that whosoeverbelieveth on me should not abide in darkness. 

{12:47} And if any manhear my words, and believe not, I judge him not: for I came not tojudge the world, but to save the world. 

{12:48} He that rejecteth me,and receiveth not my words, hath one that judgeth him: the word that Ihave spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day. 

{12:49} For Ihave not spoken of myself; but the Father which sent me, he gave me acommandment, what I should say, and what I should speak. 

{12:50} And Iknow that his commandment is life everlasting: whatsoever I speaktherefore, even as the Father said unto me, so I speak.   

{13:1} Now before the feast of the passover, when Jesus knew thathis hour was come that he should depart out of this world unto theFather, having loved his own which were in the world, he loved themunto the end. 

{13:2} And supper being ended, the devil having now putinto the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon's [son,] to betray him; 

{13:3}Jesus knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, andthat he was come from God, and went to God; 

{13:4} He riseth fromsupper, and laid aside his garments; and took a towel, and girdedhimself. 

{13:5} After that he poureth water into a bason, and began towash the disciples' feet, and to wipe [them] with the towel wherewithhe was girded. 

{13:6} Then cometh he to Simon Peter: and Peter saithunto him, Lord, dost thou wash my feet? 

{13:7} Jesus answered and saidunto him, What I do thou knowest not now; but thou shalt knowhereafter. 

{13:8} Peter saith unto him, Thou shalt never wash my feet.Jesus answered him, If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me.

{13:9} Simon Peter saith unto him, Lord, not my feet only, but also[my] hands and [my] head. 

{13:10} Jesus saith to him, He that is washedneedeth not save to wash [his] feet, but is clean every whit: and yeare clean, but not all. 

{13:11} For he knew who should betray him;therefore said he, Ye are not all clean. 

{13:12} So after he had washedtheir feet, and had taken his garments, and was set down again, he saidunto them, Know ye what I have done to you? 

{13:13} Ye call me Masterand Lord: and ye say well; for so I am. 

{13:14} If I then, [your] Lordand Master, have washed your feet; ye also ought to wash one another'sfeet. 

{13:15} For I have given you an example, that ye should do as Ihave done to you. 

{13:16} Verily, verily, I say unto you, The servantis not greater than his lord; neither he that is sent greater than hethat sent him. 

{13:17} If ye know these things, happy are ye if ye dothem.   

{13:18} I speak not of you all: I know whom I have chosen: but thatthe scripture may be fulfilled, He that eateth bread with me hathlifted up his heel against me. 

{13:19} Now I tell you before it come,that, when it is come to pass, ye may believe that I am [he. ]

{13:20}Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that receiveth whomsoever I sendreceiveth me; and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me.

{13:21} When Jesus had thus said, he was troubled in spirit, andtestified, and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, that one of youshall betray me. 

{13:22} Then the disciples looked one on another,doubting of whom he spake. 

{13:23} Now there was leaning on Jesus'bosom one of his disciples, whom Jesus loved. 

{13:24} Simon Petertherefore beckoned to him, that he should ask who it should be of whomhe spake. 

{13:25} He then lying on Jesus' breast saith unto him, Lord,who is it? 

{13:26} Jesus answered, He it is, to whom I shall give asop, when I have dipped [it.] And when he had dipped the sop, he gave[it] to Judas Iscariot, [the son] of Simon. 

{13:27} And after the sopSatan entered into him. Then said Jesus unto him, That thou doest, doquickly. 

{13:28} Now no man at the table knew for what intent he spakethis unto him. 

{13:29} For some [of them] thought, because Judas hadthe bag, that Jesus had said unto him, Buy [those things] that we haveneed of against the feast; or, that he should give something to thepoor. 

{13:30} He then having received the sop went immediately out: andit was night.   

{13:31} Therefore, when he was gone out, Jesus said, Now is the Sonof man glorified, and God is glorified in him. 

{13:32} If God beglorified in him, God shall also glorify him in himself, and shallstraightway glorify him. 

{13:33} Little children, yet a little while Iam with you. Ye shall seek me: and as I said unto the Jews, Whither Igo, ye cannot come; so now I say to you. 

{13:34} A new commandment Igive unto you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that yealso love one another. 

{13:35} By this shall all [men] know that ye aremy disciples, if ye have love one to another.   

{13:36} Simon Peter said unto him, Lord, whither goest thou? Jesusanswered him, Whither I go, thou canst not follow me now; but thoushalt follow me afterwards. 

{13:37} Peter said unto him, Lord, whycannot I follow thee now? I will lay down my life for thy sake. 

{13:38}Jesus answered him, Wilt thou lay down thy life for my sake? Verily,verily, I say unto thee, The cock shall not crow, till thou hast deniedme thrice.   

{14:1} Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believealso in me. 

{14:2} In my Father's house are many mansions: if [it were]not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you. 

{14:3}And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receiveyou unto myself; that where I am, [there] ye may be also. 

{14:4} Andwhither I go ye know, and the way ye know. 

{14:5} Thomas saith untohim, Lord, we know not whither thou goest; and how can we know the way?

{14:6} Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: noman cometh unto the Father, but by me. 

{14:7} If ye had known me, yeshould have known my Father also: and from henceforth ye know him, andhave seen him. 

{14:8} Philip saith unto him, Lord, shew us the Father,and it sufficeth us. 

{14:9} Jesus saith unto him, Have I been so longtime with you, and yet hast thou not known me, Philip? he that hathseen me hath seen the Father; and how sayest thou [then,] Shew us theFather? 

{14:10} Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and theFather in me? the words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself:but the Father that dwelleth in me, he doeth the works. 

{14:11} Believeme that I [am] in the Father, and the Father in me: or else believe mefor the very works' sake. 

{14:12} Verily, verily, I say unto you, Hethat believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also; and greater[works] than these shall he do; because I go unto my Father. 

{14:13}And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Fathermay be glorified in the Son. 

{14:14} If ye shall ask any thing in myname, I will do [it.]   

{14:15} If ye love me, keep my commandments. 

{14:16} And I will praythe Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abidewith you for ever; 

{14:17} [Even] the Spirit of truth; whom the worldcannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him: but yeknow him; for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you. 

{14:18} I willnot leave you comfortless: I will come to you. 

{14:19} Yet a littlewhile, and the world seeth me no more; but ye see me: because I live,ye shall live also. 

{14:20} At that day ye shall know that I [am] in myFather, and ye in me, and I in you. 

{14:21} He that hath mycommandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me: and he thatloveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and willmanifest myself to him. 

{14:22} Judas saith unto him, not Iscariot,Lord, how is it that thou wilt manifest thyself unto us, and not untothe world? 

{14:23} Jesus answered and said unto him, If a man love me,he will keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we will comeunto him, and make our abode with him. 

{14:24} He that loveth me notkeepeth not my sayings: and the word which ye hear is not mine, but theFather's which sent me. 

{14:25} These things have I spoken unto you,being [yet] present with you. 

{14:26} But the Comforter, [which is] theHoly Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach youall things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I havesaid unto you. 

{14:27} Peace I leave with you, my peace I give untoyou: not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart betroubled, neither let it be afraid. 

{14:28} Ye have heard how I saidunto you, I go away, and come [again] unto you. If ye loved me, yewould rejoice, because I said, I go unto the Father: for my Father isgreater than I. 

{14:29} And now I have told you before it come to pass,that, when it is come to pass, ye might believe. 

{14:30} Hereafter Iwill not talk much with you: for the prince of this world cometh, andhath nothing in me. 

{14:31} But that the world may know that I love theFather; and as the Father gave me commandment, even so I do. Arise, letus go hence.   

{15:1} I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman. 

{15:2}Every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away: and every[branch] that beareth fruit, he purgeth it, that it may bring forthmore fruit. 

{15:3} Now ye are clean through the word which I havespoken unto you. 

{15:4} Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannotbear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye,except ye abide in me. 

{15:5} I am the vine, ye [are] the branches: Hethat abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit:for without me ye can do nothing. 

{15:6} If a man abide not in me, heis cast forth as a branch, and is withered; and men gather them, andcast [them] into the fire, and they are burned. 

{15:7} If ye abide inme, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shallbe done unto you. 

{15:8} Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bearmuch fruit; so shall ye be my disciples. 

{15:9} As the Father hathloved me, so have I loved you: continue ye in my love. 

{15:10} If yekeep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I have kept myFather's commandments, and abide in his love. 

{15:11} These things haveI spoken unto you, that my joy might remain in you, and [that] your joymight be full. 

{15:12} This is my commandment, That ye love oneanother, as I have loved you. 

{15:13} Greater love hath no man thanthis, that a man lay down his life for his friends. 

{15:14} Ye are myfriends, if ye do whatsoever I command you. 

{15:15} Henceforth I callyou not servants; for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth: butI have called you friends; for all things that I have heard of myFather I have made known unto you. 

{15:16} Ye have not chosen me, but Ihave chosen you, and ordained you, that ye should go and bring forthfruit, and [that] your fruit should remain: that whatsoever ye shallask of the Father in my name, he may give it you. 

{15:17} These thingsI command you, that ye love one another. 

{15:18} If the world hate you,ye know that [it hated] me before it hated you. 

{15:19} If ye were ofthe world, the world would love his own: but because ye are not of theworld, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the worldhateth you. 

{15:20} Remember the word that I said unto you, The servantis not greater than his lord. If they have persecuted me, they willalso persecute you; if they have kept my saying, they will keep yoursalso. 

{15:21} But all these things will they do unto you for my name'ssake, because they know not him that sent me. 

{15:22} If I had not comeand spoken unto them, they had not had sin: but now they have no clokefor their sin. 

{15:23} He that hateth me hateth my Father also. 

{15:24}If I had not done among them the works which none other man did, theyhad not had sin: but now have they both seen and hated both me and myFather. 

{15:25} But [this cometh to pass,] that the word might befulfilled that is written in their law, They hated me without a cause.

{15:26} But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you fromthe Father, [even] the Spirit of truth, which proceedeth from theFather, he shall testify of me: 

{15:27} And ye also shall bear witness,because ye have been with me from the beginning.   

{16:1} These things have I spoken unto you, that ye should not beoffended. 

{16:2} They shall put you out of the synagogues: yea, thetime cometh, that whosoever killeth you will think that he doeth Godservice. 

{16:3} And these things will they do unto you, because theyhave not known the Father, nor me. 

{16:4} But these things have I toldyou, that when the time shall come, ye may remember that I told you ofthem. And these things I said not unto you at the beginning, because Iwas with you. 

{16:5} But now I go my way to him that sent me; and noneof you asketh me, Whither goest thou? 

{16:6} But because I have saidthese things unto you, sorrow hath filled your heart. 

{16:7}Nevertheless I tell you the truth; It is expedient for you that I goaway: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; butif I depart, I will send him unto you. 

{16:8} And when he is come, hewill reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment:

{16:9} Of sin, because they believe not on me; 

{16:10} Ofrighteousness, because I go to my Father, and ye see me no more;

{16:11} Of judgment, because the prince of this world is judged.

{16:12} I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear themnow. 

{16:13} Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he willguide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; butwhatsoever he shall hear, [that] shall he speak: and he will shew youthings to come. 

{16:14} He shall glorify me: for he shall receive ofmine, and shall shew [it] unto you. 

{16:15} All things that the Fatherhath are mine: therefore said I, that he shall take of mine, and shallshew [it] unto you. 

{16:16} A little while, and ye shall not see me:and again, a little while, and ye shall see me, because I go to theFather. 

{16:17} Then said [some] of his disciples among themselves,What is this that he saith unto us, A little while, and ye shall notsee me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me: and, Because Igo to the Father? 

{16:18} They said therefore, What is this that hesaith, A little while? we cannot tell what he saith. 

{16:19} Now Jesusknew that they were desirous to ask him, and said unto them, Do yeenquire among yourselves of that I said, A little while, and ye shallnot see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me? 

{16:20}Verily, verily, I say unto you, That ye shall weep and lament, but theworld shall rejoice: and ye shall be sorrowful, but your sorrow shallbe turned into joy. 

{16:21} A woman when she is in travail hath sorrow,because her hour is come: but as soon as she is delivered of the child,she remembereth no more the anguish, for joy that a man is born intothe world. 

{16:22} And ye now therefore have sorrow: but I will see youagain, and your heart shall rejoice, and your joy no man taketh fromyou. 

{16:23} And in that day ye shall ask me nothing. Verily, verily, Isay unto you, Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, he willgive [it] you. 

{16:24} Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name: ask,and ye shall receive, that your joy may be full. 

{16:25} These thingshave I spoken unto you in proverbs: but the time cometh, when I shallno more speak unto you in proverbs, but I shall shew you plainly of theFather. 

{16:26} At that day ye shall ask in my name: and I say not untoyou, that I will pray the Father for you: 

{16:27} For the Fatherhimself loveth you, because ye have loved me, and have believed that Icame out from God. 

{16:28} I came forth from the Father, and am comeinto the world: again, I leave the world, and go to the Father. 

{16:29}His disciples said unto him, Lo, now speakest thou plainly, andspeakest no proverb. 

{16:30} Now are we sure that thou knowest allthings, and needest not that any man should ask thee: by this webelieve that thou camest forth from God. 

{16:31} Jesus answered them,Do ye now believe? 

{16:32} Behold, the hour cometh, yea, is now come,that ye shall be scattered, every man to his own, and shall leave mealone: and yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me. 

{16:33}These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace. Inthe world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I haveovercome the world.   

{17:1} These words spake Jesus, and lifted up his eyes to heaven,and said, Father, the hour is come; glorify thy Son, that thy Son alsomay glorify thee: 

{17:2} As thou hast given him power over all flesh,that he should give eternal life to as many as thou hast given him.

{17:3} And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the onlytrue God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent. 

{17:4} I haveglorified thee on the earth: I have finished the work which thou gavestme to do. 

{17:5} And now, O Father, glorify thou me with thine own selfwith the glory which I had with thee before the world was. 

{17:6} Ihave manifested thy name unto the men which thou gavest me out of theworld: thine they were, and thou gavest them me; and they have kept thyword. 

{17:7} Now they have known that all things whatsoever thou hastgiven me are of thee. 

{17:8} For I have given unto them the words whichthou gavest me; and they have received [them,] and have known surelythat I came out from thee, and they have believed that thou didst sendme. 

{17:9} I pray for them: I pray not for the world, but for themwhich thou hast given me; for they are thine. 

{17:10} And all mine arethine, and thine are mine; and I am glorified in them. 

{17:11} And nowI am no more in the world, but these are in the world, and I come tothee. Holy Father, keep through thine own name those whom thou hastgiven me, that they may be one, as we [are. ]

{17:12} While I was withthem in the world, I kept them in thy name: those that thou gavest me Ihave kept, and none of them is lost, but the son of perdition; that thescripture might be fulfilled. 

{17:13} And now come I to thee; and thesethings I speak in the world, that they might have my joy fulfilled inthemselves. 

{17:14} I have given them thy word; and the world hathhated them, because they are not of the world, even as I am not of theworld. 

{17:15} I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of theworld, but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil. 

{17:16} Theyare not of the world, even as I am not of the world. 

{17:17} Sanctifythem through thy truth: thy word is truth. 

{17:18} As thou hast sent meinto the world, even so have I also sent them into the world. 

{17:19}And for their sakes I sanctify myself, that they also might besanctified through the truth. 

{17:20} Neither pray I for these alone,but for them also which shall believe on me through their word; 

{17:21}That they all may be one; as thou, Father, [art] in me, and I in thee,that they also may be one in us: that the world may believe that thouhast sent me. 

{17:22} And the glory which thou gavest me I have giventhem; that they may be one, even as we are one: 

{17:23} I in them, andthou in me, that they may be made perfect in one; and that the worldmay know that thou hast sent me, and hast loved them, as thou hastloved me. 

{17:24} Father, I will that they also, whom thou hast givenme, be with me where I am; that they may behold my glory, which thouhast given me: for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world.

{17:25} O righteous Father, the world hath not known thee: but I haveknown thee, and these have known that thou hast sent me. 

{17:26} And Ihave declared unto them thy name, and will declare [it:] that the lovewherewith thou hast loved me may be in them, and I in them.   

{18:1} When Jesus had spoken these words, he went forth with hisdisciples over the brook Cedron, where was a garden, into the which heentered, and his disciples. 

{18:2} And Judas also, which betrayed him,knew the place: for Jesus ofttimes resorted thither with his disciples.

{18:3} Judas then, having received a band [of men] and officers fromthe chief priests and Pharisees, cometh thither with lanterns andtorches and weapons. 

{18:4} Jesus therefore, knowing all things thatshould come upon him, went forth, and said unto them, Whom seek ye?

{18:5} They answered him, Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus saith unto them, Iam [he.] And Judas also, which betrayed him, stood with them. 

{18:6} Assoon then as he had said unto them, I am [he,] they went backward, andfell to the ground. 

{18:7} Then asked he them again, Whom seek ye? Andthey said, Jesus of Nazareth. 

{18:8} Jesus answered, I have told youthat I am [he:] if therefore ye seek me, let these go their way: 

{18:9}That the saying might be fulfilled, which he spake, Of them which thougavest me have I lost none. 

{18:10} Then Simon Peter having a sworddrew it, and smote the high priest's servant, and cut off his rightear. The servant's name was Malchus. 

{18:11} Then said Jesus untoPeter, Put up thy sword into the sheath: the cup which my Father hathgiven me, shall I not drink it? 

{18:12} Then the band and the captainand officers of the Jews took Jesus, and bound him, 

{18:13} And led himaway to Annas first; for he was father in law to Caiaphas, which wasthe high priest that same year. 

{18:14} Now Caiaphas was he, which gavecounsel to the Jews, that it was expedient that one man should die forthe people.   

{18:15} And Simon Peter followed Jesus, and [so did] anotherdisciple: that disciple was known unto the high priest, and went inwith Jesus into the palace of the high priest. 

{18:16} But Peter stoodat the door without. Then went out that other disciple, which was knownunto the high priest, and spake unto her that kept the door, andbrought in Peter. 

{18:17} Then saith the damsel that kept the door untoPeter, Art not thou also [one] of this man's disciples? He saith, I amnot. 

{18:18} And the servants and officers stood there, who had made afire of coals; for it was cold: and they warmed themselves: and Peterstood with them, and warmed himself.   

{18:19} The high priest then asked Jesus of his disciples, and ofhis doctrine. 

{18:20} Jesus answered him, I spake openly to the world;I ever taught in the synagogue, and in the temple, whither the Jewsalways resort; and in secret have I said nothing. 

{18:21} Why askestthou me? ask them which heard me, what I have said unto them: behold,they know what I said. 

{18:22} And when he had thus spoken, one of theofficers which stood by struck Jesus with the palm of his hand, saying,Answerest thou the high priest so? 

{18:23} Jesus answered him, If Ihave spoken evil, bear witness of the evil: but if well, why smitestthou me? 

{18:24} Now Annas had sent him bound unto Caiaphas the highpriest. 

{18:25} And Simon Peter stood and warmed himself. They saidtherefore unto him, Art not thou also [one] of his disciples? He denied[it,] and said, I am not. 

{18:26} One of the servants of the highpriest, being [his] kinsman whose ear Peter cut off, saith, Did not Isee thee in the garden with him? 

{18:27} Peter then denied again: andimmediately the cock crew.   

{18:28} Then led they Jesus from Caiaphas unto the hall of judgment:and it was early; and they themselves went not into the judgment hall,lest they should be defiled; but that they might eat the passover.

{18:29} Pilate then went out unto them, and said, What accusation bringye against this man? 

{18:30} They answered and said unto him, If hewere not a malefactor, we would not have delivered him up unto thee.

{18:31} Then said Pilate unto them, Take ye him, and judge himaccording to your law. The Jews therefore said unto him, It is notlawful for us to put any man to death: 

{18:32} That the saying of Jesusmight be fulfilled, which he spake, signifying what death he shoulddie. 

{18:33} Then Pilate entered into the judgment hall again, andcalled Jesus, and said unto him, Art thou the King of the Jews? 

{18:34}Jesus answered him, Sayest thou this thing of thyself, or did otherstell it thee of me? 

{18:35} Pilate answered, Am I a Jew? Thine ownnation and the chief priests have delivered thee unto me: what hastthou done? 

{18:36} Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world: ifmy kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that Ishould not be delivered to the Jews: but now is my kingdom not fromhence. 

{18:37} Pilate therefore said unto him, Art thou a king then?Jesus answered, Thou sayest that I am a king. To this end was I born,and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witnessunto the truth. Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice.

{18:38} Pilate saith unto him, What is truth? And when he had saidthis, he went out again unto the Jews, and saith unto them, I find inhim no fault [at all. ]

{18:39} But ye have a custom, that I shouldrelease unto you one at the passover: will ye therefore that I releaseunto you the King of the Jews? 

{18:40} Then cried they all again,saying, Not this man, but Barabbas. Now Barabbas was a robber.   

{19:1} Then Pilate therefore took Jesus, and scourged [him. ]

{19:2}And the soldiers platted a crown of thorns, and put [it] on his head,and they put on him a purple robe, 

{19:3} And said, Hail, King of theJews! and they smote him with their hands. 

{19:4} Pilate therefore wentforth again, and saith unto them, Behold, I bring him forth to you,that ye may know that I find no fault in him. 

{19:5} Then came Jesusforth, wearing the crown of thorns, and the purple robe. And [Pilate]saith unto them, Behold the man! 

{19:6} When the chief prieststherefore and officers saw him, they cried out, saying, Crucify [him,]crucify [him.] Pilate saith unto them, Take ye him, and crucify [him:]for I find no fault in him. 

{19:7} The Jews answered him, We have alaw, and by our law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son ofGod.   

{19:8} When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he was the moreafraid; 

{19:9} And went again into the judgment hall, and saith untoJesus, Whence art thou? But Jesus gave him no answer. 

{19:10} Thensaith Pilate unto him, Speakest thou not unto me? knowest thou not thatI have power to crucify thee, and have power to release thee? 

{19:11}Jesus answered, Thou couldest have no power [at all] against me, exceptit were given thee from above: therefore he that delivered me unto theehath the greater sin. 

{19:12} And from thenceforth Pilate sought torelease him: but the Jews cried out, saying, If thou let this man go,thou art not Caesar's friend: whosoever maketh himself a king speakethagainst Caesar.   

{19:13} When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he brought Jesusforth, and sat down in the judgment seat in a place that is called thePavement, but in the Hebrew, Gabbatha. 

{19:14} And it was thepreparation of the passover, and about the sixth hour: and he saithunto the Jews, Behold your King! 

{19:15} But they cried out, Away with[him,] away with [him,] crucify him. Pilate saith unto them, Shall Icrucify your King? The chief priests answered, We have no king butCaesar. 

{19:16} Then delivered he him therefore unto them to becrucified. And they took Jesus, and led [him] away. 

{19:17} And hebearing his cross went forth into a place called [the place] of askull, which is called in the Hebrew Golgotha: 

{19:18} Where theycrucified him, and two others with him, on either side one, and Jesusin the midst.   

{19:19} And Pilate wrote a title, and put [it] on the cross. And thewriting was, JESUS OF NAZARETH THE KING OF THE JEWS. 

{19:20} This titlethen read many of the Jews: for the place where Jesus was crucified wasnigh to the city: and it was written in Hebrew, [and] Greek, [and]Latin. 

{19:21} Then said the chief priests of the Jews to Pilate, Writenot, The King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews.

{19:22} Pilate answered, What I have written I have written.   

{19:23} Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took hisgarments, and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and also [his]coat: now the coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout.

{19:24} They said therefore among themselves, Let us not rend it, butcast lots for it, whose it shall be: that the scripture might befulfilled, which saith, They parted my raiment among them, and for myvesture they did cast lots. These things therefore the soldiers did.   

{19:25} Now there stood by the cross of Jesus his mother, and hismother's sister, Mary the [wife] of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene.

{19:26} When Jesus therefore saw his mother, and the disciple standingby, whom he loved, he saith unto his mother, Woman, behold thy son!

{19:27} Then saith he to the disciple, Behold thy mother! And from thathour that disciple took her unto his own [home.]   

{19:28} After this, Jesus knowing that all things were nowaccomplished, that the scripture might be fulfilled, saith, I thirst.

{19:29} Now there was set a vessel full of vinegar: and they filled aspunge with vinegar, and put [it] upon hyssop, and put [it] to hismouth. 

{19:30} When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said,It is finished: and he bowed his head, and gave up the ghost. 

{19:31}The Jews therefore, because it was the preparation, that the bodiesshould not remain upon the cross on the sabbath day, (for that sabbathday was an high day,) besought Pilate that their legs might be broken,and [that] they might be taken away. 

{19:32} Then came the soldiers,and brake the legs of the first, and of the other which was crucifiedwith him. 

{19:33} But when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was deadalready, they brake not his legs: 

{19:34} But one of the soldiers witha spear pierced his side, and forthwith came there out blood and water.

{19:35} And he that saw [it] bare record, and his record is true: andhe knoweth that he saith true, that ye might believe. 

{19:36} For thesethings were done, that the scripture should be fulfilled, A bone of himshall not be broken. 

{19:37} And again another scripture saith, Theyshall look on him whom they pierced.   

{19:38} And after this Joseph of Arimathaea, being a disciple ofJesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews, besought Pilate that he mighttake away the body of Jesus: and Pilate gave [him] leave. He cametherefore, and took the body of Jesus. 

{19:39} And there came alsoNicodemus, which at the first came to Jesus by night, and brought amixture of myrrh and aloes, about an hundred pound [weight. ]

{19:40}Then took they the body of Jesus, and wound it in linen clothes withthe spices, as the manner of the Jews is to bury. 

{19:41} Now in theplace where he was crucified there was a garden; and in the garden anew sepulchre, wherein was never man yet laid. 

{19:42} There laid theyJesus therefore because of the Jews' preparation [day;] for thesepulchre was nigh at hand.   

{20:1} The first [day] of the week cometh Mary Magdalene early, whenit was yet dark, unto the sepulchre, and seeth the stone taken awayfrom the sepulchre. 

{20:2} Then she runneth, and cometh to Simon Peter,and to the other disciple, whom Jesus loved, and saith unto them, Theyhave taken away the Lord out of the sepulchre, and we know not wherethey have laid him. 

{20:3} Peter therefore went forth, and that otherdisciple, and came to the sepulchre. 

{20:4} So they ran both together:and the other disciple did outrun Peter, and came first to thesepulchre. 

{20:5} And he stooping down, [and looking in,] saw the linenclothes lying; yet went he not in. 

{20:6} Then cometh Simon Peterfollowing him, and went into the sepulchre, and seeth the linen clotheslie, 

{20:7} And the napkin, that was about his head, not lying with thelinen clothes, but wrapped together in a place by itself. 

{20:8} Thenwent in also that other disciple, which came first to the sepulchre,and he saw, and believed. 

{20:9} For as yet they knew not thescripture, that he must rise again from the dead. 

{20:10} Then thedisciples went away again unto their own home.   

{20:11} But Mary stood without at the sepulchre weeping: and as shewept, she stooped down, [and looked] into the sepulchre, 

{20:12} Andseeth two angels in white sitting, the one at the head, and the otherat the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain. 

{20:13} And they sayunto her, Woman, why weepest thou? She saith unto them, Because theyhave taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid him.

{20:14} And when she had thus said, she turned herself back, and sawJesus standing, and knew not that it was Jesus. 

{20:15} Jesus saithunto her, Woman, why weepest thou? whom seekest thou? She, supposinghim to be the gardener, saith unto him, Sir, if thou have borne himhence, tell me where thou hast laid him, and I will take him away.

{20:16} Jesus saith unto her, Mary. She turned herself, and saith untohim, Rabboni; which is to say, Master. 

{20:17} Jesus saith unto her,Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to my Father: but go to mybrethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father, and your Father;and [to] my God, and your God. 

{20:18} Mary Magdalene came and told thedisciples that she had seen the Lord, and [that] he had spoken thesethings unto her.   

{20:19} Then the same day at evening, being the first [day] of theweek, when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled forfear of the Jews, came Jesus and stood in the midst, and saith untothem, Peace [be] unto you. 

{20:20} And when he had so said, he shewedunto them [his] hands and his side. Then were the disciples glad, whenthey saw the Lord. 

{20:21} Then said Jesus to them again, Peace [be]unto you: as [my] Father hath sent me, even so send I you. 

{20:22} Andwhen he had said this, he breathed on [them,] and saith unto them,Receive ye the Holy Ghost: 

{20:23} Whose soever sins ye remit, they areremitted unto them; [and] whose soever [sins] ye retain, they areretained.   

{20:24} But Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, was not withthem when Jesus came. 

{20:25} The other disciples therefore said untohim, We have seen the Lord. But he said unto them, Except I shall seein his hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into the printof the nails, and thrust my hand into his side, I will not believe.   

{20:26} And after eight days again his disciples were within, andThomas with them: [then] came Jesus, the doors being shut, and stood inthe midst, and said, Peace [be] unto you. 

{20:27} Then saith he toThomas, reach hither thy finger, and behold my hands; and reach hitherthy hand, and thrust [it] into my side: and be not faithless, butbelieving. 

{20:28} And Thomas answered and said unto him, My Lord andmy God. 

{20:29} Jesus saith unto him, Thomas, because thou hast seenme, thou hast believed: blessed [are] they that have not seen, and[yet] have believed.   

{20:30} And many other signs truly did Jesus in the presence of hisdisciples, which are not written in this book: 

{20:31} But these arewritten, that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son ofGod; and that believing ye might have life through his name.   

{21:1} After these things Jesus shewed himself again to thedisciples at the sea of Tiberias; and on this wise shewed he [himself.]

{21:2} There were together Simon Peter, and Thomas called Didymus, andNathanael of Cana in Galilee, and the [sons] of Zebedee, and two otherof his disciples. 

{21:3} Simon Peter saith unto them, I go a fishing.They say unto him, We also go with thee. They went forth, and enteredinto a ship immediately; and that night they caught nothing. 

{21:4} Butwhen the morning was now come, Jesus stood on the shore: but thedisciples knew not that it was Jesus. 

{21:5} Then Jesus saith untothem, Children, have ye any meat? They answered him, No. 

{21:6} And hesaid unto them, Cast the net on the right side of the ship, and yeshall find. They cast therefore, and now they were not able to draw itfor the multitude of fishes. 

{21:7} Therefore that disciple whom Jesusloved saith unto Peter, It is the Lord. Now when Simon Peter heard thatit was the Lord, he girt [his] fisher's coat [unto him,] (for he wasnaked,) and did cast himself into the sea. 

{21:8} And the otherdisciples came in a little ship; (for they were not far from land, butas it were two hundred cubits,) dragging the net with fishes. 

{21:9} Assoon then as they were come to land, they saw a fire of coals there,and fish laid thereon, and bread. 

{21:10} Jesus saith unto them, Bringof the fish which ye have now caught. 

{21:11} Simon Peter went up, anddrew the net to land full of great fishes, and hundred and fifty andthree: and for all there were so many, yet was not the net broken.

{21:12} Jesus saith unto them, Come [and] dine. And none of thedisciples durst ask him, Who art thou? knowing that it was the Lord.

{21:13} Jesus then cometh, and taketh bread, and giveth them, and fishlikewise. 

{21:14} This is now the third time that Jesus shewed himselfto his disciples, after that he was risen from the dead.   

{21:15} So when they had dined, Jesus saith to Simon Peter, Simon,[son] of Jonas, lovest thou me more than these? He saith unto him, Yea,Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, Feed my lambs.

{21:16} He saith to him again the second time, Simon, [son] of Jonas,lovest thou me? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I lovethee. He saith unto him, Feed my sheep. 

{21:17} He saith unto him thethird time, Simon, [son] of Jonas, lovest thou me? Peter was grievedbecause he said unto him the third time, Lovest thou me? And he saidunto him, Lord, thou knowest all things; thou knowest that I love thee.Jesus saith unto him, Feed my sheep. 

{21:18} Verily, verily, I say untothee, When thou wast young, thou girdedst thyself, and walkedst whitherthou wouldest: but when thou shalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thyhands, and another shall gird thee, and carry [thee] whither thouwouldest not. 

{21:19} This spake he, signifying by what death he shouldglorify God. And when he had spoken this, he saith unto him, Follow me.

{21:20} Then Peter, turning about, seeth the disciple whom Jesus lovedfollowing; which also leaned on his breast at supper, and said, Lord,which is he that betrayeth thee? 

{21:21} Peter seeing him saith toJesus, Lord, and what [shall] this man [do? ]

{21:22} Jesus saith untohim, If I will that he tarry till I come, what [is that] to thee?follow thou me. 

{21:23} Then went this saying abroad among thebrethren, that that disciple should not die: yet Jesus said not untohim, He shall not die; but, If I will that he tarry till I come, what[is that] to thee? 

{21:24} This is the disciple which testifieth ofthese things, and wrote these things: and we know that his testimony istrue. 

{21:25} And there are also many other things which Jesus did, thewhich, if they should be written every one, I suppose that even theworld itself could not contain the books that should be written. Amen.
