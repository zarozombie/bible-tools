{The First Epistle General of John   

{1:1} That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, whichwe have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our handshave handled, of the Word of life; 

{1:2} (For the life was manifested,and we have seen [it,] and bear witness, and shew unto you that eternallife, which was with the Father, and was manifested unto us;) 

{1:3}That which we have seen and heard declare we unto you, that ye also mayhave fellowship with us: and truly our fellowship [is] with the Father,and with his Son Jesus Christ. 

{1:4} And these things write we untoyou, that your joy may be full.   

{1:5} This then is the message which we have heard of him, anddeclare unto you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.

{1:6} If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness,we lie, and do not the truth: 

{1:7} But if we walk in the light, as heis in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood ofJesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin. 

{1:8} If we say that wehave no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us. 

{1:9} Ifwe confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us [our] sins,and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. 

{1:10} If we say that wehave not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us.   

{2:1} My little children, these things write I unto you, that ye sinnot. And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, JesusChrist the righteous: 

{2:2} And he is the propitiation for our sins:and not for ours only, but also for [the sins of] the whole world.

{2:3} And hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep hiscommandments. 

{2:4} He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not hiscommandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him. 

{2:5} But whosokeepeth his word, in him verily is the love of God perfected: herebyknow we that we are in him. 

{2:6} He that saith he abideth in him oughthimself also so to walk, even as he walked.   

{2:7} Brethren, I write no new commandment unto you, but an oldcommandment which ye had from the beginning. The old commandment is theword which ye have heard from the beginning. 

{2:8} Again, a newcommandment I write unto you, which thing is true in him and in you:because the darkness is past, and the true light now shineth. 

{2:9} Hethat saith he is in the light, and hateth his brother, is in darknesseven until now. 

{2:10} He that loveth his brother abideth in the light,and there is none occasion of stumbling in him. 

{2:11} But he thathateth his brother is in darkness, and walketh in darkness, and knowethnot whither he goeth, because that darkness hath blinded his eyes.

{2:12} I write unto you, little children, because your sins areforgiven you for his name's sake. 

{2:13} I write unto you, fathers,because ye have known him [that is] from the beginning. I write untoyou, young men, because ye have overcome the wicked one. I write untoyou, little children, because ye have known the Father. 

{2:14} I havewritten unto you, fathers, because ye have known him [that is] from thebeginning. I have written unto you, young men, because ye are strong,and the word of God abideth in you, and ye have overcome the wickedone. 

{2:15} Love not the world, neither the things [that are] in theworld. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.

{2:16} For all that [is] in the world, the lust of the flesh, and thelust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but isof the world. 

{2:17} And the world passeth away, and the lust thereof:but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever.   

{2:18} Little children, it is the last time: and as ye have heardthat antichrist shall come, even now are there many antichrists;whereby we know that it is the last time. 

{2:19} They went out from us,but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would [nodoubt] have continued with us: but [they went out,] that they might bemade manifest that they were not all of us. 

{2:20} But ye have anunction from the Holy One, and ye know all things. 

{2:21} I have notwritten unto you because ye know not the truth, but because ye know it,and that no lie is of the truth. 

{2:22} Who is a liar but he thatdenieth that Jesus is the Christ? He is antichrist, that denieth theFather and the Son. 

{2:23} Whosoever denieth the Son, the same hath notthe Father: [(but) he that acknowledgeth the Son hath the Father also.]

{2:24} Let that therefore abide in you, which ye have heard from thebeginning. If that which ye have heard from the beginning shall remainin you, ye also shall continue in the Son, and in the Father. 

{2:25}And this is the promise that he hath promised us, [even] eternal life.

{2:26} These [things] have I written unto you concerning them thatseduce you. 

{2:27} But the anointing which ye have received of himabideth in you, and ye need not that any man teach you: but as the sameanointing teacheth you of all things, and is truth, and is no lie, andeven as it hath taught you, ye shall abide in him. 

{2:28} And now,little children, abide in him; that, when he shall appear, we may haveconfidence, and not be ashamed before him at his coming. 

{2:29} If yeknow that he is righteous, ye know that every one that doethrighteousness is born of him.   

{3:1} Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us,that we should be called the sons of God: therefore the world knowethus not, because it knew him not. 

{3:2} Beloved, now are we the sons ofGod, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that,when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as heis. 

{3:3} And every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself,even as he is pure. 

{3:4} Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth alsothe law: for sin is the transgression of the law. 

{3:5} And ye knowthat he was manifested to take away our sins; and in him is no sin.

{3:6} Whosoever abideth in him sinneth not: whosoever sinneth hath notseen him, neither known him. 

{3:7} Little children, let no man deceiveyou: he that doeth righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous.

{3:8} He that committeth sin is of the devil; for the devil sinnethfrom the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was manifested,that he might destroy the works of the devil. 

{3:9} Whosoever is bornof God doth not commit sin; for his seed remaineth in him: and hecannot sin, because he is born of God. 

{3:10} In this the children ofGod are manifest, and the children of the devil: whosoever doeth notrighteousness is not of God, neither he that loveth not his brother.

{3:11} For this is the message that ye heard from the beginning, thatwe should love one another. 

{3:12} Not as Cain, [who] was of thatwicked one, and slew his brother. And wherefore slew he him? Becausehis own works were evil, and his brother's righteous.   

{3:13} Marvel not, my brethren, if the world hate you. 

{3:14} Weknow that we have passed from death unto life, because we love thebrethren. He that loveth not [his] brother abideth in death. 

{3:15}Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer: and ye know that nomurderer hath eternal life abiding in him. 

{3:16} Hereby perceive wethe love [of God,] because he laid down his life for us: and we oughtto lay down [our] lives for the brethren. 

{3:17} But whoso hath thisworld's good, and seeth his brother have need, and shutteth up hisbowels [of compassion] from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him?

{3:18} My little children, let us not love in word, neither in tongue;but in deed and in truth. 

{3:19} And hereby we know that we are of thetruth, and shall assure our hearts before him. 

{3:20} For if our heartcondemn us, God is greater than our heart, and knoweth all things.

{3:21} Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, [then] have we confidencetoward God. 

{3:22} And whatsoever we ask, we receive of him, because wekeep his commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in hissight. 

{3:23} And this is his commandment, That we should believe onthe name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, as he gave uscommandment. 

{3:24} And he that keepeth his commandments dwelleth inhim, and he in him. And hereby we know that he abideth in us, by theSpirit which he hath given us.   

{4:1} Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whetherthey are of God: because many false prophets are gone out into theworld. 

{4:2} Hereby know ye the Spirit of God: Every spirit thatconfesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God: 

{4:3} Andevery spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the fleshis not of God: and this is that [spirit] of antichrist, whereof ye haveheard that it should come; and even now already is it in the world.

{4:4} Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them: becausegreater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world. 

{4:5} Theyare of the world: therefore speak they of the world, and the worldheareth them. 

{4:6} We are of God: he that knoweth God heareth us; hethat is not of God heareth not us. Hereby know we the spirit of truth,and the spirit of error.   

{4:7} Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; andevery one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God. 

{4:8} He thatloveth not knoweth not God; for God is love. 

{4:9} In this wasmanifested the love of God toward us, because that God sent his onlybegotten Son into the world, that we might live through him. 

{4:10}Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and senthis Son [to be] the propitiation for our sins. 

{4:11} Beloved, if Godso loved us, we ought also to love one another. 

{4:12} No man hath seenGod at any time. If we love one another, God dwelleth in us, and hislove is perfected in us. 

{4:13} Hereby know we that we dwell in him,and he in us, because he hath given us of his Spirit. 

{4:14} And wehave seen and do testify that the Father sent the Son [to be] theSaviour of the world. 

{4:15} Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is theSon of God, God dwelleth in him, and he in God. 

{4:16} And we haveknown and believed the love that God hath to us. God is love; and hethat dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him. 

{4:17} Herein isour love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day ofjudgment: because as he is, so are we in this world. 

{4:18} There is nofear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear: because fear hathtorment. He that feareth is not made perfect in love. 

{4:19} We lovehim, because he first loved us. 

{4:20} If a man say, I love God, andhateth his brother, he is a liar: for he that loveth not his brotherwhom he hath seen, how can he love God whom he hath not seen? 

{4:21}And this commandment have we from him, That he who loveth God love hisbrother also.   

{5:1} Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God:and every one that loveth him that begat loveth him also that isbegotten of him. 

{5:2} By this we know that we love the children ofGod, when we love God, and keep his commandments. 

{5:3} For this is thelove of God, that we keep his commandments: and his commandments arenot grievous. 

{5:4} For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world:and this is the victory that overcometh the world, [even] our faith.

{5:5} Who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth thatJesus is the Son of God? 

{5:6} This is he that came by water and blood,[even] Jesus Christ; not by water only, but by water and blood. And itis the Spirit that beareth witness, because the Spirit is truth. 

{5:7}For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word,and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one. 

{5:8} And there are threethat bear witness in earth, the spirit, and the water, and the blood:and these three agree in one. 

{5:9} If we receive the witness of men,the witness of God is greater: for this is the witness of God which hehath testified of his Son. 

{5:10} He that believeth on the Son of Godhath the witness in himself: he that believeth not God hath made him aliar; because he believeth not the record that God gave of his Son.

{5:11} And this is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life,and this life is in his Son. 

{5:12} He that hath the Son hath life;[and] he that hath not the Son of God hath not life. 

{5:13} Thesethings have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son ofGod; that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that ye maybelieve on the name of the Son of God. 

{5:14} And this is theconfidence that we have in him, that, if we ask any thing according tohis will, he heareth us: 

{5:15} And if we know that he hear us,whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the petitions that we desiredof him. 

{5:16} If any man see his brother sin a sin [which is] not untodeath, he shall ask, and he shall give him life for them that sin notunto death. There is a sin unto death: I do not say that he shall prayfor it. 

{5:17} All unrighteousness is sin: and there is a sin not untodeath. 

{5:18} We know that whosoever is born of God sinneth not; but hethat is begotten of God keepeth himself, and that wicked one touchethhim not. 

{5:19} And we know that we are of God, and the whole worldlieth in wickedness. 

{5:20} [And] we know that the Son of God is come,and hath given us an understanding, that we may know him that is true,and we are in him that is true, [even] in his Son Jesus Christ. This isthe true God, and eternal life. 

{5:21} Little children, keep yourselvesfrom idols. Amen.
