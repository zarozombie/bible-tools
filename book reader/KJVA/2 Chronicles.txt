{The Second Book of the Chronicles   

{1:1} And Solomon the son of David was strengthened in his kingdom,and the LORD his God [was] with him, and magnified him exceedingly.

{1:2} Then Solomon spake unto all Israel, to the captains of thousandsand of hundreds, and to the judges, and to every governor in allIsrael, the chief of the fathers. 

{1:3} So Solomon, and all thecongregation with him, went to the high place that [was] at Gibeon; forthere was the tabernacle of the congregation of God, which Moses theservant of the LORD had made in the wilderness. 

{1:4} But the ark ofGod had David brought up from Kirjath-jearim to [the place which] Davidhad prepared for it: for he had pitched a tent for it at Jerusalem.

{1:5} Moreover the brasen altar, that Bezaleel the son of Uri, the sonof Hur, had made, he put before the tabernacle of the LORD: and Solomonand the congregation sought unto it. 

{1:6} And Solomon went up thitherto the brasen altar before the LORD, which [was] at the tabernacle ofthe congregation, and offered a thousand burnt offerings upon it.   

{1:7} In that night did God appear unto Solomon, and said unto him,Ask what I shall give thee. 

{1:8} And Solomon said unto God, Thou hastshewed great mercy unto David my father, and hast made me to reign inhis stead. 

{1:9} Now, O LORD God, let thy promise unto David my fatherbe established: for thou hast made me king over a people like the dustof the earth in multitude. 

{1:10} Give me now wisdom and knowledge,that I may go out and come in before this people: for who can judgethis thy people, [that is so] great? 

{1:11} And God said to Solomon,Because this was in thine heart, and thou hast not asked riches,wealth, or honour, nor the life of thine enemies, neither yet hastasked long life; but hast asked wisdom and knowledge for thyself, thatthou mayest judge my people, over whom I have made thee king: 

{1:12}Wisdom and knowledge [is] granted unto thee; and I will give theeriches, and wealth, and honour, such as none of the kings have had that[have been] before thee, neither shall there any after thee have thelike.   

{1:13} Then Solomon came [from his journey] to the high place that[was] at Gibeon to Jerusalem, from before the tabernacle of thecongregation, and reigned over Israel. 

{1:14} And Solomon gatheredchariots and horsemen: and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots,and twelve thousand horsemen, which he placed in the chariot cities,and with the king at Jerusalem. 

{1:15} And the king made silver andgold at Jerusalem [as plenteous] as stones, and cedar trees made he asthe sycomore trees that [are] in the vale for abundance. 

{1:16} AndSolomon had horses brought out of Egypt, and linen yarn: the king'smerchants received the linen yarn at a price. 

{1:17} And they fetchedup, and brought forth out of Egypt a chariot for six hundred [shekels]of silver, and an horse for an hundred and fifty: and so brought theyout [horses] for all the kings of the Hittites, and for the kings ofSyria, by their means.   

{2:1} And Solomon determined to build an house for the name of theLORD, and an house for his kingdom. 

{2:2} And Solomon told outthreescore and ten thousand men to bear burdens, and fourscore thousandto hew in the mountain, and three thousand and six hundred to overseethem.   

{2:3} And Solomon sent to Huram the king of Tyre, saying, As thoudidst deal with David my father, and didst send him cedars to build himan house to dwell therein, [even so deal with me. ]

{2:4} Behold, Ibuild an house to the name of the LORD my God, to dedicate [it] to him,[and] to burn before him sweet incense, and for the continualshewbread, and for the burnt offerings morning and evening, on thesabbaths, and on the new moons, and on the solemn feasts of the LORDour God. This [is an ordinance] for ever to Israel. 

{2:5} And the housewhich I build [is] great: for great [is] our God above all gods. 

{2:6}But who is able to build him an house, seeing the heaven and heaven ofheavens cannot contain him? who [am] I then, that I should build him anhouse, save only to burn sacrifice before him? 

{2:7} Send me nowtherefore a man cunning to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass,and in iron, and in purple, and crimson, and blue, and that can skillto grave with the cunning men that [are] with me in Judah and inJerusalem, whom David my father did provide. 

{2:8} Send me also cedartrees, fir trees, and algum trees, out of Lebanon: for I know that thyservants can skill to cut timber in Lebanon; and, behold, my servants[shall be] with thy servants, 

{2:9} Even to prepare me timber inabundance: for the house which I am about to build [shall be] wonderfulgreat. 

{2:10} And, behold, I will give to thy servants, the hewers thatcut timber, twenty thousand measures of beaten wheat, and twentythousand measures of barley, and twenty thousand baths of wine, andtwenty thousand baths of oil.   

{2:11} Then Huram the king of Tyre answered in writing, which hesent to Solomon, Because the LORD hath loved his people, he hath madethee king over them. 

{2:12} Huram said moreover, Blessed [be] the LORDGod of Israel, that made heaven and earth, who hath given to David theking a wise son, endued with prudence and understanding, that mightbuild an house for the LORD, and an house for his kingdom. 

{2:13} Andnow I have sent a cunning man, endued with understanding, of Huram myfather's, 

{2:14} The son of a woman of the daughters of Dan, and hisfather [was] a man of Tyre, skilful to work in gold, and in silver, inbrass, in iron, in stone, and in timber, in purple, in blue, and infine linen, and in crimson; also to grave any manner of graving, and tofind out every device which shall be put to him, with thy cunning men,and with the cunning men of my lord David thy father. 

{2:15} Nowtherefore the wheat, and the barley, the oil, and the wine, which mylord hath spoken of, let him send unto his servants: 

{2:16} And we willcut wood out of Lebanon, as much as thou shalt need: and we will bringit to thee in flotes by sea to Joppa; and thou shall carry it up toJerusalem.   

{2:17} And Solomon numbered all the strangers that [were] in theland of Israel, after the numbering wherewith David his father hadnumbered them; and they were found an hundred and fifty thousand andthree thousand and six hundred. 

{2:18} And he set threescore and tenthousand of them [to be] bearers of burdens, and fourscore thousand [tobe] hewers in the mountain, and three thousand and six hundredoverseers to set the people a work.   

{3:1} Then Solomon began to build the house of the LORD at Jerusalemin mount Moriah, where [the LORD] appeared unto David his father, inthe place that David had prepared in the threshingfloor of Ornan theJebusite. 

{3:2} And he began to build in the second [day] of the secondmonth, in the fourth year of his reign.   

{3:3} Now these [are the things wherein] Solomon was instructed forthe building of the house of God. The length by cubits after the firstmeasure [was] threescore cubits, and the breadth twenty cubits. 

{3:4}And the porch that [was] in the front [of the house,] the length [of itwas] according to the breadth of the house, twenty cubits, and theheight [was] an hundred and twenty: and he overlaid it within with puregold. 

{3:5} And the greater house he cieled with fir tree, which heoverlaid with fine gold, and set thereon palm trees and chains. 

{3:6}And he garnished the house with precious stones for beauty: and thegold [was] gold of Parvaim. 

{3:7} He overlaid also the house, thebeams, the posts, and the walls thereof, and the doors thereof, withgold; and graved cherubims on the walls. 

{3:8} And he made the mostholy house, the length whereof [was] according to the breadth of thehouse, twenty cubits, and the breadth thereof twenty cubits: and heoverlaid it with fine gold, [amounting] to six hundred talents. 

{3:9}And the weight of the nails [was] fifty shekels of gold. And heoverlaid the upper chambers with gold. 

{3:10} And in the most holyhouse he made two cherubims of image work, and overlaid them with gold.   

{3:11} And the wings of the cherubims [were] twenty cubits long: onewing [of the one cherub was] five cubits, reaching to the wall of thehouse: and the other wing [was likewise] five cubits, reaching to thewing of the other cherub. 

{3:12} And [one] wing of the other cherub[was] five cubits, reaching to the wall of the house: and the otherwing [was] five cubits [also,] joining to the wing of the other cherub.

{3:13} The wings of these cherubims spread themselves forth twentycubits: and they stood on their feet, and their faces [were] inward.   

{3:14} And he made the vail [of] blue, and purple, and crimson, andfine linen, and wrought cherubims thereon. 

{3:15} Also he made beforethe house two pillars of thirty and five cubits high, and the chapiterthat [was] on the top of each of them [was] five cubits. 

{3:16} And hemade chains, [as] in the oracle, and put [them] on the heads of thepillars; and made an hundred pomegranates, and put [them] on thechains. 

{3:17} And he reared up the pillars before the temple, one onthe right hand, and the other on the left; and called the name of thaton the right hand Jachin, and the name of that on the left Boaz.   

{4:1} Moreover he made an altar of brass, twenty cubits the lengththereof, and twenty cubits the breadth thereof, and ten cubits theheight thereof.   

{4:2} Also he made a molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim,round in compass, and five cubits the height thereof; and a line ofthirty cubits did compass it round about. 

{4:3} And under it [was] thesimilitude of oxen, which did compass it round about: ten in a cubit,compassing the sea round about. Two rows of oxen [were] cast, when itwas cast. 

{4:4} It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward thenorth, and three looking toward the west, and three looking toward thesouth, and three looking toward the east: and the sea [was set] aboveupon them, and all their hinder parts [were] inward. 

{4:5} And thethickness of it [was] an handbreadth, and the brim of it like the workof the brim of a cup, with flowers of lilies; [and] it received andheld three thousand baths.   

{4:6} He made also ten lavers, and put five on the right hand,andfive on the left, to wash in them: such things as they offered for theburnt offering they washed in them; but the sea [was] for the prieststo wash in. 

{4:7} And he made ten candlesticks of gold according totheir form, and set [them] in the temple, five on the right hand, andfive on the left. 

{4:8} He made also ten tables, and placed [them] inthe temple, five on the right side, and five on the left. And he madean hundred basons of gold.   

{4:9} Furthermore he made the court of the priests, and the greatcourt, and doors for the court, and overlaid the doors of them withbrass. 

{4:10} And he set the sea on the right side of the east end,over against the south. 

{4:11} And Huram made the pots, and theshovels, and the basons. And Huram finished the work that he was tomake for king Solomon for the house of God; 

{4:12} [To wit,] the twopillars, and the pommels, and the chapiters [which were] on the top ofthe two pillars, and the two wreaths to cover the two pommels of thechapiters which [were] on the top of the pillars; 

{4:13} And fourhundred pomegranates on the two wreaths; two rows of pomegranates oneach wreath, to cover the two pommels of the chapiters which [were]upon the pillars. 

{4:14} He made also bases, and lavers made he uponthe bases; 

{4:15} One sea, and twelve oxen under it. 

{4:16} The potsalso, and the shovels, and the fleshhooks, and all their instruments,did Huram his father make to king Solomon for the house of the LORD ofbright brass. 

{4:17} In the plain of Jordan did the king cast them, inthe clay ground between Succoth and Zeredathah. 

{4:18} Thus Solomonmade all these vessels in great abundance: for the weight of the brasscould not be found out.   

{4:19} And Solomon made all the vessels that [were for] the house ofGod, the golden altar also, and the tables whereon the shewbread [wasset; ]

{4:20} Moreover the candlesticks with their lamps, that theyshould burn after the manner before the oracle, of pure gold; 

{4:21}And the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs, [made he of] gold, [and]that perfect gold; 

{4:22} And the snuffers, and the basons, and thespoons, and the censers, [of] pure gold: and the entry of the house,the inner doors thereof for the most holy [place,] and the doors of thehouse of the temple, [were of] gold.   

{5:1} Thus all the work that Solomon made for the house of the LORDwas finished: and Solomon brought in [all] the things that David hisfather had dedicated; and the silver, and the gold, and all theinstruments, put he among the treasures of the house of God.   

{5:2} Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the headsof the tribes, the chief of the fathers of the children of Israel, untoJerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of thecity of David, which [is] Zion. 

{5:3} Wherefore all the men of Israelassembled themselves unto the king in the feast which [was] in theseventh month. 

{5:4} And all the elders of Israel came; and the Levitestook up the ark. 

{5:5} And they brought up the ark, and the tabernacleof the congregation, and all the holy vessels that [were] in thetabernacle, these did the priests and the Levites bring up. 

{5:6} Alsoking Solomon, and all the congregation of Israel that were assembledunto him before the ark, sacrificed sheep and oxen, which could not betold nor numbered for multitude. 

{5:7} And the priests brought in theark of the covenant of the LORD unto his place, to the oracle of thehouse, into the most holy [place, even] under the wings of thecherubims: 

{5:8} For the cherubims spread forth [their] wings over theplace of the ark, and the cherubims covered the ark and the stavesthereof above. 

{5:9} And they drew out the staves [of the ark,] thatthe ends of the staves were seen from the ark before the oracle; butthey were not seen without. And there it is unto this day. 

{5:10}[There was] nothing in the ark save the two tables which Moses put[therein] at Horeb, when the LORD made [a covenant] with the childrenof Israel, when they came out of Egypt.   

{5:11} And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of theholy [place:] (for all the priests [that were] present were sanctified,[and] did not [then] wait by course: 

{5:12} Also the Levites [whichwere] the singers, all of them of Asaph, of Heman, of Jeduthun, withtheir sons and their brethren, [being] arrayed in white linen, havingcymbals and psalteries and harps, stood at the east end of the altar,and with them an hundred and twenty priests sounding with trumpets:)

{5:13} It came even to pass, as the trumpeters and singers [were] asone, to make one sound to be heard in praising and thanking the LORD;and when they lifted up [their] voice with the trumpets and cymbals andinstruments of musick, and praised the LORD, [saying,] For [he is]good; for his mercy [endureth] for ever: that [then] the house wasfilled with a cloud, [even] the house of the LORD; 

{5:14} So that thepriests could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud: for theglory of the LORD had filled the house of God.   

{6:1} Then said Solomon, The LORD hath said that he would dwell inthe thick darkness. 

{6:2} But I have built an house of habitation forthee, and a place for thy dwelling for ever. 

{6:3} And the king turnedhis face, and blessed the whole congregation of Israel: and all thecongregation of Israel stood. 

{6:4} And he said, Blessed [be] the LORDGod of Israel, who hath with his hands fulfilled [that] which he spakewith his mouth to my father David, saying, 

{6:5} Since the day that Ibrought forth my people out of the land of Egypt I chose no city amongall the tribes of Israel to build an house in, that my name might bethere; neither chose I any man to be a ruler over my people Israel:

{6:6} But I have chosen Jerusalem, that my name might be there; andhave chosen David to be over my people Israel. 

{6:7} Now it was in theheart of David my father to build an house for the name of the LORD Godof Israel. 

{6:8} But the LORD said to David my father, Forasmuch as itwas in thine heart to build an house for my name, thou didst well inthat it was in thine heart: 

{6:9} Notwithstanding thou shalt not buildthe house; but thy son which shall come forth out of thy loins, heshall build the house for my name. 

{6:10} The LORD therefore hathperformed his word that he hath spoken: for I am risen up in the roomof David my father, and am set on the throne of Israel, as the LORDpromised, and have built the house for the name of the LORD God ofIsrael. 

{6:11} And in it have I put the ark, wherein [is] the covenantof the LORD, that he made with the children of Israel.   

{6:12} And he stood before the altar of the LORD in the presence ofall the congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands: 

{6:13} ForSolomon had made a brasen scaffold, of five cubits long, and fivecubits broad, and three cubits high, and had set it in the midst of thecourt: and upon it he stood, and kneeled down upon his knees before allthe congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands toward heaven,

{6:14} And said, O LORD God of Israel, [there is] no God like thee inthe heaven, nor in the earth; which keepest covenant, and [shewest]mercy unto thy servants, that walk before thee with all their hearts:

{6:15} Thou which hast kept with thy servant David my father that whichthou hast promised him; and spakest with thy mouth, and hast fulfilled[it] with thine hand, as [it is] this day. 

{6:16} Now therefore, O LORDGod of Israel, keep with thy servant David my father that which thouhast promised him, saying, There shall not fail thee a man in my sightto sit upon the throne of Israel; yet so that thy children take heed totheir way to walk in my law, as thou hast walked before me. 

{6:17} Nowthen, O LORD God of Israel, let thy word be verified, which thou hastspoken unto thy servant David. 

{6:18} But will God in very deed dwellwith men on the earth? behold, heaven and the heaven of heavens cannotcontain thee; how much less this house which I have built! 

{6:19} Haverespect therefore to the prayer of thy servant, and to hissupplication, O LORD my God, to hearken unto the cry and the prayerwhich thy servant prayeth before thee: 

{6:20} That thine eyes may beopen upon this house day and night, upon the place whereof thou hastsaid that thou wouldest put thy name there; to hearken unto the prayerwhich thy servant prayeth toward this place. 

{6:21} Hearken thereforeunto the supplications of thy servant, and of thy people Israel, whichthey shall make toward this place: hear thou from thy dwelling place,[even] from heaven; and when thou hearest, forgive.   

{6:22} If a man sin against his neighbour, and an oath be laid uponhim to make him swear, and the oath come before thine altar in thishouse; 

{6:23} Then hear thou from heaven, and do, and judge thyservants, by requiting the wicked, by recompensing his way upon his ownhead; and by justifying the righteous, by giving him according to hisrighteousness.   

{6:24} And if thy people Israel be put to the worse before theenemy, because they have sinned against thee; and shall return andconfess thy name, and pray and make supplication before thee in thishouse; 

{6:25} Then hear thou from the heavens, and forgive the sin ofthy people Israel, and bring them again unto the land which thou gavestto them and to their fathers.   

{6:26} When the heaven is shut up, and there is no rain, becausethey have sinned against thee; [yet] if they pray toward this place,and confess thy name, and turn from their sin, when thou dost afflictthem; 

{6:27} Then hear thou from heaven, and forgive the sin of thyservants, and of thy people Israel, when thou hast taught them the goodway, wherein they should walk; and send rain upon thy land, which thouhast given unto thy people for an inheritance.   

{6:28} If there be dearth in the land, if there be pestilence, ifthere be blasting, or mildew, locusts, or caterpillers; if theirenemies besiege them in the cities of their land; whatsoever sore orwhatsoever sickness [there be: ]

{6:29} [Then] what prayer [or] whatsupplication soever shall be made of any man, or of all thy peopleIsrael, when every one shall know his own sore and his own grief, andshall spread forth his hands in this house: 

{6:30} Then hear thou fromheaven thy dwelling place, and forgive, and render unto every manaccording unto all his ways, whose heart thou knowest; (for thou onlyknowest the hearts of the children of men:) 

{6:31} That they may fearthee, to walk in thy ways, so long as they live in the land which thougavest unto our fathers.   

{6:32} Moreover concerning the stranger, which is not of thy peopleIsrael, but is come from a far country for thy great name's sake, andthy mighty hand, and thy stretched out arm; if they come and pray inthis house; 

{6:33} Then hear thou from the heavens, [even] from thydwelling place, and do according to all that the stranger calleth tothee for; that all people of the earth may know thy name, and fearthee, as [doth] thy people Israel, and may know that this house which Ihave built is called by thy name. 

{6:34} If thy people go out to waragainst their enemies by the way that thou shalt send them, and theypray unto thee toward this city which thou hast chosen, and the housewhich I have built for thy name; 

{6:35} Then hear thou from the heavenstheir prayer and their supplication, and maintain their cause. 

{6:36}If they sin against thee, (for [there is] no man which sinneth not,)and thou be angry with them, and deliver them over before [their]enemies, and they carry them away captives unto a land far off or near;

{6:37} Yet [if] they bethink themselves in the land whither they arecarried captive, and turn and pray unto thee in the land of theircaptivity, saying, We have sinned, we have done amiss, and have dealtwickedly; 

{6:38} If they return to thee with all their heart and withall their soul in the land of their captivity, whither they havecarried them captives, and pray toward their land, which thou gavestunto their fathers, and [toward] the city which thou hast chosen, andtoward the house which I have built for thy name: 

{6:39} Then hear thoufrom the heavens, [even] from thy dwelling place, their prayer andtheir supplications, and maintain their cause, and forgive thy peoplewhich have sinned against thee. 

{6:40} Now, my God, let, I beseechthee, thine eyes be open, and [let] thine ears [be] attent unto theprayer [that is made] in this place. 

{6:41} Now therefore arise, O LORDGod, into thy resting place, thou, and the ark of thy strength: let thypriests, O LORD God, be clothed with salvation, and let thy saintsrejoice in goodness. 

{6:42} O LORD God, turn not away the face of thineanointed: remember the mercies of David thy servant.   

{7:1} Now when Solomon had made an end of praying, the fire camedown from heaven, and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices;and the glory of the LORD filled the house. 

{7:2} And the priests couldnot enter into the house of the LORD, because the glory of the LORD hadfilled the LORD'S house. 

{7:3} And when all the children of Israel sawhow the fire came down, and the glory of the LORD upon the house, theybowed themselves with their faces to the ground upon the pavement, andworshipped, and praised the LORD, [saying,] For [he is] good; for hismercy [endureth] for ever.   

{7:4} Then the king and all the people offered sacrifices before theLORD. 

{7:5} And king Solomon offered a sacrifice of twenty and twothousand oxen, and an hundred and twenty thousand sheep: so the kingand all the people dedicated the house of God. 

{7:6} And the priestswaited on their offices: the Levites also with instruments of musick ofthe LORD, which David the king had made to praise the LORD, because hismercy [endureth] for ever, when David praised by their ministry; andthe priests sounded trumpets before them, and all Israel stood. 

{7:7}Moreover Solomon hallowed the middle of the court that [was] before thehouse of the LORD: for there he offered burnt offerings, and the fat ofthe peace offerings, because the brasen altar which Solomon had madewas not able to receive the burnt offerings, and the meat offerings,and the fat.   

{7:8} Also at the same time Solomon kept the feast seven days, andall Israel with him, a very great congregation, from the entering in ofHamath unto the river of Egypt. 

{7:9} And in the eighth day they made asolemn assembly: for they kept the dedication of the altar seven days,and the feast seven days. 

{7:10} And on the three and twentieth day ofthe seventh month he sent the people away into their tents, glad andmerry in heart for the goodness that the LORD had shewed unto David,and to Solomon, and to Israel his people. 

{7:11} Thus Solomon finishedthe house of the LORD, and the king's house: and all that came intoSolomon's heart to make in the house of the LORD, and in his own house,he prosperously effected.   

{7:12} And the LORD appeared to Solomon by night, and said unto him,I have heard thy prayer, and have chosen this place to myself for anhouse of sacrifice. 

{7:13} If I shut up heaven that there be no rain,or if I command the locusts to devour the land, or if I send pestilenceamong my people; 

{7:14} If my people, which are called by my name,shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn fromtheir wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive theirsin, and will heal their land. 

{7:15} Now mine eyes shall be open, andmine ears attent unto the prayer [that is made] in this place. 

{7:16}For now have I chosen and sanctified this house, that my name may bethere for ever: and mine eyes and mine heart shall be thereperpetually. 

{7:17} And as for thee, if thou wilt walk before me, asDavid thy father walked, and do according to all that I have commandedthee, and shalt observe my statutes and my judgments; 

{7:18} Then willI stablish the throne of thy kingdom, according as I have covenantedwith David thy father, saying, There shall not fail thee a man [to be]ruler in Israel. 

{7:19} But if ye turn away, and forsake my statutesand my commandments, which I have set before you, and shall go andserve other gods, and worship them; 

{7:20} Then will I pluck them up bythe roots out of my land which I have given them; and this house, whichI have sanctified for my name, will I cast out of my sight, and willmake it [to be] a proverb and a byword among all nations. 

{7:21} Andthis house, which is high, shall be an astonishment to every one thatpasseth by it; so that he shall say, Why hath the LORD done thus untothis land, and unto this house? 

{7:22} And it shall be answered,Because they forsook the LORD God of their fathers, which brought themforth out of the land of Egypt, and laid hold on other gods, andworshipped them, and served them: therefore hath he brought all thisevil upon them.   

{8:1} And it came to pass at the end of twenty years, whereinSolomon had built the house of the LORD, and his own house, 

{8:2} Thatthe cities which Huram had restored to Solomon, Solomon built them, andcaused the children of Israel to dwell there. 

{8:3} And Solomon went toHamath-zobah, and prevailed against it. 

{8:4} And he built Tadmor inthe wilderness, and all the store cities, which he built in Hamath.

{8:5} Also he built Beth- horon the upper, and Beth-horon the nether,fenced cities, with walls, gates, and bars; 

{8:6} And Baalath, and allthe store cities that Solomon had, and all the chariot cities, and thecities of the horsemen, and all that Solomon desired to build inJerusalem, and in Lebanon, and throughout all the land of his dominion.   

{8:7} [As for] all the people [that were] left of the Hittites, andthe Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites,which [were] not of Israel, 

{8:8} [But] of their children, who wereleft after them in the land, whom the children of Israel consumed not,them did Solomon make to pay tribute until this day. 

{8:9} But of thechildren of Israel did Solomon make no servants for his work; but they[were] men of war, and chief of his captains, and captains of hischariots and horsemen. 

{8:10} And these [were] the chief of kingSolomon's officers, [even] two hundred and fifty, that bare rule overthe people.   

{8:11} And Solomon brought up the daughter of Pharaoh out of thecity of David unto the house that he had built for her: for he said, Mywife shall not dwell in the house of David king of Israel, because [theplaces are] holy, whereunto the ark of the LORD hath come.   

{8:12} Then Solomon offered burnt offerings unto the LORD on thealtar of the LORD, which he had built before the porch, 

{8:13} Evenafter a certain rate every day, offering according to the commandmentof Moses, on the sabbaths, and on the new moons, and on the solemnfeasts, three times in the year, [even] in the feast of unleavenedbread, and in the feast of weeks, and in the feast of tabernacles.   

{8:14} And he appointed, according to the order of David his father,the courses of the priests to their service, and the Levites to theircharges, to praise and minister before the priests, as the duty ofevery day required: the porters also by their courses at every gate:for so had David the man of God commanded. 

{8:15} And they departed notfrom the commandment of the king unto the priests and Levitesconcerning any matter, or concerning the treasures. 

{8:16} Now all thework of Solomon was prepared unto the day of the foundation of thehouse of the LORD, and until it was finished. So the house of the LORDwas perfected.   

{8:17} Then went Solomon to Ezion-geber, and to Eloth, at the seaside in the land of Edom. 

{8:18} And Huram sent him by the hands of hisservants ships, and servants that had knowledge of the sea; and theywent with the servants of Solomon to Ophir, and took thence fourhundred and fifty talents of gold, and brought [them] to king Solomon.   

{9:1} And when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon, shecame to prove Solomon with hard questions at Jerusalem, with a verygreat company, and camels that bare spices, and gold in abundance, andprecious stones: and when she was come to Solomon, she communed withhim of all that was in her heart. 

{9:2} And Solomon told her all herquestions: and there was nothing hid from Solomon which he told hernot. 

{9:3} And when the queen of Sheba had seen the wisdom of Solomon,and the house that he had built, 

{9:4} And the meat of his table, andthe sitting of his servants, and the attendance of his ministers, andtheir apparel; his cupbearers also, and their apparel; and his ascentby which he went up into the house of the LORD; there was no morespirit in her. 

{9:5} And she said to the king, [It was] a true reportwhich I heard in mine own land of thine acts, and of thy wisdom: 

{9:6}Howbeit I believed not their words, until I came, and mine eyes hadseen [it:] and, behold, the one half of the greatness of thy wisdom wasnot told me: [for] thou exceedest the fame that I heard. 

{9:7} Happy[are] thy men, and happy [are] these thy servants, which standcontinually before thee, and hear thy wisdom. 

{9:8} Blessed be the LORDthy God, which delighted in thee to set thee on his throne, [to be]king for the LORD thy God: because thy God loved Israel, to establishthem for ever, therefore made he thee king over them, to do judgmentand justice. 

{9:9} And she gave the king an hundred and twenty talentsof gold, and of spices great abundance, and precious stones: neitherwas there any such spice as the queen of Sheba gave king Solomon.

{9:10} And the servants also of Huram, and the servants of Solomon,which brought gold from Ophir, brought algum trees and precious stones.

{9:11} And the king made [of] the algum trees terraces to the house ofthe LORD, and to the king's palace, and harps and psalteries forsingers: and there were none such seen before in the land of Judah.

{9:12} And king Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire,whatsoever she asked, beside [that] which she had brought unto theking. So she turned, and went away to her own land, she and herservants.   

{9:13} Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year wassix hundred and threescore and six talents of gold; 

{9:14} Beside [thatwhich] chapmen and merchants brought. And all the kings of Arabia andgovernors of the country brought gold and silver to Solomon.   

{9:15} And king Solomon made two hundred targets of beaten gold: sixhundred [shekels] of beaten gold went to one target. 

{9:16} And threehundred shields [made he of] beaten gold: three hundred [shekels] ofgold went to one shield. And the king put them in the house of theforest of Lebanon. 

{9:17} Moreover the king made a great throne ofivory, and overlaid it with pure gold. 

{9:18} And [there were] sixsteps to the throne, with a footstool of gold, [which were] fastened tothe throne, and stays on each side of the sitting place, and two lionsstanding by the stays: 

{9:19} And twelve lions stood there on the oneside and on the other upon the six steps. There was not the like madein any kingdom.   

{9:20} And all the drinking vessels of king Solomon [were of] gold,and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon [were of]pure gold: none [were of] silver; it was [not] any thing accounted ofin the days of Solomon. 

{9:21} For the king's ships went to Tarshishwith the servants of Huram: every three years once came the ships ofTarshish bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks.

{9:22} And king Solomon passed all the kings of the earth in riches andwisdom.   

{9:23} And all the kings of the earth sought the presence ofSolomon, to hear his wisdom, that God had put in his heart. 

{9:24} Andthey brought every man his present, vessels of silver, and vessels ofgold, and raiment, harness, and spices, horses, and mules, a rate yearby year.   

{9:25} And Solomon had four thousand stalls for horses and chariots,and twelve thousand horsemen; whom he bestowed in the chariot cities,and with the king at Jerusalem.   

{9:26} And he reigned over all the kings from the river even untothe land of the Philistines, and to the border of Egypt. 

{9:27} And theking made silver in Jerusalem as stones, and cedar trees made he as thesycomore trees that [are] in the low plains in abundance. 

{9:28} Andthey brought unto Solomon horses out of Egypt, and out of all lands.   

{9:29} Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, first and last, [are]they not written in the book of Nathan the prophet, and in the prophecyof Ahijah the Shilonite, and in the visions of Iddo the seer againstJeroboam the son of Nebat? 

{9:30} And Solomon reigned in Jerusalem overall Israel forty years. 

{9:31} And Solomon slept with his fathers, andhe was buried in the city of David his father: and Rehoboam his sonreigned in his stead.   

{10:1} And Rehoboam went to Shechem: for to Shechem were all Israelcome to make him king. 

{10:2} And it came to pass, when Jeroboam theson of Nebat, who [was] in Egypt, whither he had fled from the presenceof Solomon the king, heard [it,] that Jeroboam returned out of Egypt.

{10:3} And they sent and called him. So Jeroboam and all Israel cameand spake to Rehoboam, saying, 

{10:4} Thy father made our yokegrievous: now therefore ease thou somewhat the grievous servitude ofthy father, and his heavy yoke that he put upon us, and we will servethee. 

{10:5} And he said unto them, Come again unto me after threedays. And the people departed.   

{10:6} And king Rehoboam took counsel with the old men that hadstood before Solomon his father while he yet lived, saying, Whatcounsel give ye [me] to return answer to this people? 

{10:7} And theyspake unto him, saying, If thou be kind to this people, and pleasethem, and speak good words to them, they will be thy servants for ever.

{10:8} But he forsook the counsel which the old men gave him, and tookcounsel with the young men that were brought up with him, that stoodbefore him. 

{10:9} And he said unto them, What advice give ye that wemay return answer to this people, which have spoken to me, saying, Easesomewhat the yoke that thy father did put upon us? 

{10:10} And theyoung men that were brought up with him spake unto him, saying, Thusshalt thou answer the people that spake unto thee, saying, Thy fathermade our yoke heavy, but make thou [it] somewhat lighter for us; thusshalt thou say unto them, My little [finger] shall be thicker than myfather's loins. 

{10:11} For whereas my father put a heavy yoke uponyou, I will put more to your yoke: my father chastised you with whips,but I [will chastise you] with scorpions. 

{10:12} So Jeroboam and allthe people came to Rehoboam on the third day, as the king bade, saying,Come again to me on the third day. 

{10:13} And the king answered themroughly; and king Rehoboam forsook the counsel of the old men, 

{10:14}And answered them after the advice of the young men, saying, My fathermade your yoke heavy, but I will add thereto: my father chastised youwith whips, but I [will chastise you] with scorpions. 

{10:15} So theking hearkened not unto the people: for the cause was of God, that theLORD might perform his word, which he spake by the hand of Ahijah theShilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat.   

{10:16} And when all Israel [saw] that the king would not hearkenunto them, the people answered the king, saying, What portion have wein David? and [we have] none inheritance in the son of Jesse: every manto your tents, O Israel: [and] now, David, see to thine own house. Soall Israel went to their tents. 

{10:17} But [as for] the children ofIsrael that dwelt in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them.

{10:18} Then king Rehoboam sent Hadoram that [was] over the tribute;and the children of Israel stoned him with stones, that he died. Butking Rehoboam made speed to get him up to [his] chariot, to flee toJerusalem. 

{10:19} And Israel rebelled against the house of David untothis day.   

{11:1} And when Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem, he gathered of thehouse of Judah and Benjamin an hundred and fourscore thousand chosen[men,] which were warriors, to fight against Israel, that he mightbring the kingdom again to Rehoboam. 

{11:2} But the word of the LORDcame to Shemaiah the man of God, saying, 

{11:3} Speak unto Rehoboam theson of Solomon, king of Judah, and to all Israel in Judah and Benjamin,saying, 

{11:4} Thus saith the LORD, Ye shall not go up, nor fightagainst your brethren: return every man to his house: for this thing isdone of me. And they obeyed the words of the LORD, and returned fromgoing against Jeroboam.   

{11:5} And Rehoboam dwelt in Jerusalem, and built cities for defencein Judah. 

{11:6} He built even Bethlehem, and Etam, and Tekoa, 

{11:7}And Beth-zur, and Shoco, and Adullam, 

{11:8} And Gath, and Mareshah,and Ziph, 

{11:9} And Adoraim, and Lachish, and Azekah, 

{11:10} AndZorah, and Aijalon, and Hebron, which [are] in Judah and in Benjaminfenced cities. 

{11:11} And he fortified the strong holds, and putcaptains in them, and store of victual, and of oil and wine. 

{11:12}And in every several city [he put] shields and spears, and made themexceeding strong, having Judah and Benjamin on his side.   

{11:13} And the priests and the Levites that [were] in all Israelresorted to him out of all their coasts. 

{11:14} For the Levites lefttheir suburbs and their possession, and came to Judah and Jerusalem:for Jeroboam and his sons had cast them off from executing the priest'soffice unto the LORD: 

{11:15} And he ordained him priests for the highplaces, and for the devils, and for the calves which he had made.

{11:16} And after them out of all the tribes of Israel such as settheir hearts to seek the LORD God of Israel came to Jerusalem, tosacrifice unto the LORD God of their fathers. 

{11:17} So theystrengthened the kingdom of Judah, and made Rehoboam the son of Solomonstrong, three years: for three years they walked in the way of Davidand Solomon.   

{11:18} And Rehoboam took him Mahalath the daughter of Jerimoth theson of David to wife, [and] Abihail the daughter of Eliab the son ofJesse; 

{11:19} Which bare him children; Jeush, and Shamariah, andZaham. 

{11:20} And after her he took Maachah the daughter of Absalom;which bare him Abijah, and Attai, and Ziza, and Shelomith. 

{11:21} AndRehoboam loved Maachah the daughter of Absalom above all his wives andhis concubines: (for he took eighteen wives, and threescore concubines;and begat twenty and eight sons, and threescore daughters.) 

{11:22} AndRehoboam made Abijah the son of Maachah the chief, to be ruler amonghis brethren: for [he thought] to make him king. 

{11:23} And he dealtwisely, and dispersed of all his children throughout all the countriesof Judah and Benjamin, unto every fenced city: and he gave them victualin abundance. And he desired many wives.   

{12:1} And it came to pass, when Rehoboam had established thekingdom, and had strengthened himself, he forsook the law of the LORD,and all Israel with him. 

{12:2} And it came to pass, [that] in thefifth year of king Rehoboam Shishak king of Egypt came up againstJerusalem, because they had transgressed against the LORD, 

{12:3} Withtwelve hundred chariots, and threescore thousand horsemen: and thepeople [were] without number that came with him out of Egypt; theLubim, the Sukkiims, and the Ethiopians. 

{12:4} And he took the fencedcities which [pertained] to Judah, and came to Jerusalem.   

{12:5} Then came Shemaiah the prophet to Rehoboam, and [to] theprinces of Judah, that were gathered together to Jerusalem because ofShishak, and said unto them, Thus saith the LORD, Ye have forsaken me,and therefore have I also left you in the hand of Shishak. 

{12:6}Whereupon the princes of Israel and the king humbled themselves; andthey said, The LORD [is] righteous. 

{12:7} And when the LORD saw thatthey humbled themselves, the word of the LORD came to Shemaiah, saying,They have humbled themselves; [therefore] I will not destroy them, butI will grant them some deliverance; and my wrath shall not be pouredout upon Jerusalem by the hand of Shishak. 

{12:8} Nevertheless theyshall be his servants; that they may know my service, and the serviceof the kingdoms of the countries. 

{12:9} So Shishak king of Egypt cameup against Jerusalem, and took away the treasures of the house of theLORD, and the treasures of the king's house; he took all: he carriedaway also the shields of gold which Solomon had made. 

{12:10} Insteadof which king Rehoboam made shields of brass, and committed [them] tothe hands of the chief of the guard, that kept the entrance of theking's house. 

{12:11} And when the king entered into the house of theLORD, the guard came and fetched them, and brought them again into theguard chamber. 

{12:12} And when he humbled himself, the wrath of theLORD turned from him that he would not destroy [him] altogether: andalso in Judah things went well.   

{12:13} So king Rehoboam strengthened himself in Jerusalem, andreigned: for Rehoboam [was] one and forty years old when he began toreign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which theLORD had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, to put his name there.And his mother's name [was] Naamah an Ammonitess. 

{12:14} And he didevil, because he prepared not his heart to seek the LORD. 

{12:15} Nowthe acts of Rehoboam, first and last, [are] they not written in thebook of Shemaiah the prophet, and of Iddo the seer concerninggenealogies? And [there were] wars between Rehoboam and Jeroboamcontinually. 

{12:16} And Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and wasburied in the city of David: and Abijah his son reigned in his stead.   

{13:1} Now in the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam began Abijah toreign over Judah. 

{13:2} He reigned three years in Jerusalem. Hismother's name also [was] Michaiah the daughter of Uriel of Gibeah. Andthere was war between Abijah and Jeroboam. 

{13:3} And Abijah set thebattle in array with an army of valiant men of war, [even] four hundredthousand chosen men: Jeroboam also set the battle in array against himwith eight hundred thousand chosen men, [being] mighty men of valour.   

{13:4} And Abijah stood up upon mount Zemaraim, which [is] in mountEphraim, and said, Hear me, thou Jeroboam, and all Israel; 

{13:5} Oughtye not to know that the LORD God of Israel gave the kingdom over Israelto David for ever, [even] to him and to his sons by a covenant of salt?

{13:6} Yet Jeroboam the son of Nebat, the servant of Solomon the son ofDavid, is risen up, and hath rebelled against his lord. 

{13:7} Andthere are gathered unto him vain men, the children of Belial, and havestrengthened themselves against Rehoboam the son of Solomon, whenRehoboam was young and tenderhearted, and could not withstand them.

{13:8} And now ye think to withstand the kingdom of the LORD in thehand of the sons of David; and ye [be] a great multitude, and [thereare] with you golden calves, which Jeroboam made you for gods. 

{13:9}Have ye not cast out the priests of the LORD, the sons of Aaron, andthe Levites, and have made you priests after the manner of the nationsof [other] lands? so that whosoever cometh to consecrate himself with ayoung bullock and seven rams, [the same] may be a priest of [them thatare] no gods. 

{13:10} But as for us, the LORD [is] our God, and we havenot forsaken him; and the priests, which minister unto the LORD, [are]the sons of Aaron, and the Levites [wait] upon [their] business:

{13:11} And they burn unto the LORD every morning and every eveningburnt sacrifices and sweet incense: the shewbread also [set they inorder] upon the pure table; and the candlestick of gold with the lampsthereof, to burn every evening: for we keep the charge of the LORD ourGod; but ye have forsaken him. 

{13:12} And, behold, God himself is withus for [our] captain, and his priests with sounding trumpets to cryalarm against you. O children of Israel, fight ye not against the LORDGod of your fathers; for ye shall not prosper.   

{13:13} But Jeroboam caused an ambushment to come about behind them:so they were before Judah, and the ambushment [was] behind them.

{13:14} And when Judah looked back, behold, the battle [was] before andbehind: and they cried unto the LORD, and the priests sounded with thetrumpets. 

{13:15} Then the men of Judah gave a shout: and as the men ofJudah shouted, it came to pass, that God smote Jeroboam and all Israelbefore Abijah and Judah. 

{13:16} And the children of Israel fled beforeJudah: and God delivered them into their hand. 

{13:17} And Abijah andhis people slew them with a great slaughter: so there fell down slainof Israel five hundred thousand chosen men. 

{13:18} Thus the childrenof Israel were brought under at that time, and the children of Judahprevailed, because they relied upon the LORD God of their fathers.

{13:19} And Abijah pursued after Jeroboam, and took cities from him,Bethel with the towns thereof, and Jeshanah with the towns thereof, andEphrain with the towns thereof. 

{13:20} Neither did Jeroboam recoverstrength again in the days of Abijah: and the LORD struck him, and hedied.   

{13:21} But Abijah waxed mighty, and married fourteen wives, andbegat twenty and two sons, and sixteen daughters. 

{13:22} And the restof the acts of Abijah, and his ways, and his sayings, [are] written inthe story of the prophet Iddo.   

{14:1} So Abijah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in thecity of David: and Asa his son reigned in his stead. In his days theland was quiet ten years. 

{14:2} And Asa did [that which was] good andright in the eyes of the LORD his God: 

{14:3} For he took away thealtars of the strange [gods,] and the high places, and brake down theimages, and cut down the groves: 

{14:4} And commanded Judah to seek theLORD God of their fathers, and to do the law and the commandment.

{14:5} Also he took away out of all the cities of Judah the high placesand the images: and the kingdom was quiet before him.   

{14:6} And he built fenced cities in Judah: for the land had rest,and he had no war in those years; because the LORD had given him rest.

{14:7} Therefore he said unto Judah, Let us build these cities, andmake about [them] walls, and towers, gates, and bars, [while] the land[is] yet before us; because we have sought the LORD our God, we havesought [him,] and he hath given us rest on every side. So they builtand prospered. 

{14:8} And Asa had an army [of men] that bare targetsand spears, out of Judah three hundred thousand; and out of Benjamin,that bare shields and drew bows, two hundred and fourscore thousand:all these [were] mighty men of valour.   

{14:9} And there came out against them Zerah the Ethiopian with anhost of a thousand thousand, and three hundred chariots; and came untoMareshah. 

{14:10} Then Asa went out against him, and they set thebattle in array in the valley of Zephathah at Mareshah. 

{14:11} And Asacried unto the LORD his God, and said, LORD, [it is] nothing with theeto help, whether with many, or with them that have no power: help us, OLORD our God; for we rest on thee, and in thy name we go against thismultitude. O LORD, thou [art] our God; let not man prevail againstthee. 

{14:12} So the LORD smote the Ethiopians before Asa and beforeJudah; and the Ethiopians fled. 

{14:13} And Asa and the people that[were] with him pursued them unto Gerar: and the Ethiopians wereoverthrown, that they could not recover themselves; for they weredestroyed before the LORD, and before his host; and they carried awayvery much spoil. 

{14:14} And they smote all the cities round aboutGerar; for the fear of the LORD came upon them: and they spoiled allthe cities; for there was exceeding much spoil in them. 

{14:15} Theysmote also the tents of cattle, and carried away sheep and camels inabundance, and returned to Jerusalem.   

{15:1} And the Spirit of God came upon Azariah the son of Oded:

{15:2} And he went out to meet Asa, and said unto him, Hear ye me, Asa,and all Judah and Benjamin; The LORD [is] with you, while ye be withhim; and if ye seek him, he will be found of you; but if ye forsakehim, he will forsake you. 

{15:3} Now for a long season Israel [hathbeen] without the true God, and without a teaching priest, and withoutlaw. 

{15:4} But when they in their trouble did turn unto the LORD Godof Israel, and sought him, he was found of them. 

{15:5} And in thosetimes [there was] no peace to him that went out, nor to him that camein, but great vexations [were] upon all the inhabitants of thecountries. 

{15:6} And nation was destroyed of nation, and city of city:for God did vex them with all adversity. 

{15:7} Be ye strong therefore,and let not your hands be weak: for your work shall be rewarded. 

{15:8}And when Asa heard these words, and the prophecy of Oded the prophet,he took courage, and put away the abominable idols out of all the landof Judah and Benjamin, and out of the cities which he had taken frommount Ephraim, and renewed the altar of the LORD, that [was] before theporch of the LORD. 

{15:9} And he gathered all Judah and Benjamin, andthe strangers with them out of Ephraim and Manasseh, and out of Simeon:for they fell to him out of Israel in abundance, when they saw that theLORD his God [was] with him. 

{15:10} So they gathered themselvestogether at Jerusalem in the third month, in the fifteenth year of thereign of Asa. 

{15:11} And they offered unto the LORD the same time, ofthe spoil [which] they had brought, seven hundred oxen and seventhousand sheep. 

{15:12} And they entered into a covenant to seek theLORD God of their fathers with all their heart and with all their soul;

{15:13} That whosoever would not seek the LORD God of Israel should beput to death, whether small or great, whether man or woman. 

{15:14} Andthey sware unto the LORD with a loud voice, and with shouting, and withtrumpets, and with cornets. 

{15:15} And all Judah rejoiced at the oath:for they had sworn with all their heart, and sought him with theirwhole desire; and he was found of them: and the LORD gave them restround about.   

{15:16} And also [concerning] Maachah the mother of Asa the king, heremoved her from [being] queen, because she had made an idol in agrove: and Asa cut down her idol, and stamped [it,] and burnt [it] atthe brook Kidron. 

{15:17} But the high places were not taken away outof Israel: nevertheless the heart of Asa was perfect all his days.   

{15:18} And he brought into the house of God the things that hisfather had dedicated, and that he himself had dedicated, silver, andgold, and vessels. 

{15:19} And there was no [more] war unto the fiveand thirtieth year of the reign of Asa.   

{16:1} In the six and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa Baasha kingof Israel came up against Judah, and built Ramah, to the intent that hemight let none go out or come in to Asa king of Judah. 

{16:2} Then Asabrought out silver and gold out of the treasures of the house of theLORD and of the king's house, and sent to Ben-hadad king of Syria, thatdwelt at Damascus, saying, 

{16:3} [There is] a league between me andthee, as [there was] between my father and thy father: behold, I havesent thee silver and gold; go, break thy league with Baasha king ofIsrael, that he may depart from me. 

{16:4} And Ben- hadad hearkenedunto king Asa, and sent the captains of his armies against the citiesof Israel; and they smote Ijon, and Dan, and Abel-maim, and all thestore cities of Naphtali. 

{16:5} And it came to pass, when Baasha heard[it,] that he left off building of Ramah, and let his work cease.

{16:6} Then Asa the king took all Judah; and they carried away thestones of Ramah, and the timber thereof, wherewith Baasha was building;and he built therewith Geba and Mizpah.   

{16:7} And at that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah,and said unto him, Because thou hast relied on the king of Syria, andnot relied on the LORD thy God, therefore is the host of the king ofSyria escaped out of thine hand. 

{16:8} Were not the Ethiopians and theLubims a huge host, with very many chariots and horsemen? yet, becausethou didst rely on the LORD, he delivered them into thine hand. 

{16:9}For the eyes of the LORD run to and fro throughout the whole earth, toshew himself strong in the behalf of [them] whose heart [is] perfecttoward him. Herein thou hast done foolishly: therefore from henceforththou shalt have wars. 

{16:10} Then Asa was wroth with the seer, and puthim in a prison house; for [he was] in a rage with him because of this[thing.] And Asa oppressed [some] of the people the same time.   

{16:11} And, behold, the acts of Asa, first and last, lo, they [are]written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel. 

{16:12} And Asain the thirty and ninth year of his reign was diseased in his feet,until his disease [was] exceeding [great:] yet in his disease he soughtnot to the LORD, but to the physicians.   

{16:13} And Asa slept with his fathers, and died in the one andfortieth year of his reign. 

{16:14} And they buried him in his ownsepulchres, which he had made for himself in the city of David, andlaid him in the bed which was filled with sweet odours and divers kinds[of spices] prepared by the apothecaries' art: and they made a verygreat burning for him.   

{17:1} And Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his stead, andstrengthened himself against Israel. 

{17:2} And he placed forces in allthe fenced cities of Judah, and set garrisons in the land of Judah, andin the cities of Ephraim, which Asa his father had taken. 

{17:3} Andthe LORD was with Jehoshaphat, because he walked in the first ways ofhis father David, and sought not unto Baalim; 

{17:4} But sought to the[LORD] God of his father, and walked in his commandments, and not afterthe doings of Israel. 

{17:5} Therefore the LORD stablished the kingdomin his hand; and all Judah brought to Jehoshaphat presents; and he hadriches and honour in abundance. 

{17:6} And his heart was lifted up inthe ways of the LORD: moreover he took away the high places and grovesout of Judah.   

{17:7} Also in the third year of his reign he sent to his princes,[even] to Ben-hail, and to Obadiah, and to Zechariah, and to Nethaneel,and to Michaiah, to teach in the cities of Judah. 

{17:8} And with them[he sent] Levites, [even] Shemaiah, and Nethaniah, and Zebadiah, andAsahel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehonathan, and Adonijah, and Tobijah, andTob-adonijah, Levites; and with them Elishama and Jehoram, priests.

{17:9} And they taught in Judah, and [had] the book of the law of theLORD with them, and went about throughout all the cities of Judah, andtaught the people.   

{17:10} And the fear of the LORD fell upon all the kingdoms of thelands that [were] round about Judah, so that they made no war againstJehoshaphat. 

{17:11} Also [some] of the Philistines brought Jehoshaphatpresents, and tribute silver; and the Arabians brought him flocks,seven thousand and seven hundred rams, and seven thousand and sevenhundred he goats.   

{17:12} And Jehoshaphat waxed great exceedingly; and he built inJudah castles, and cities of store. 

{17:13} And he had much business inthe cities of Judah: and the men of war, mighty men of valour, [were]in Jerusalem. 

{17:14} And these [are] the numbers of them according tothe house of their fathers: Of Judah, the captains of thousands; Adnahthe chief, and with him mighty men of valour three hundred thousand.

{17:15} And next to him [was] Jehohanan the captain, and with him twohundred and fourscore thousand. 

{17:16} And next him [was] Amasiah theson of Zichri, who willingly offered himself unto the LORD; and withhim two hundred thousand mighty men of valour. 

{17:17} And of Benjamin;Eliada a mighty man of valour, and with him armed men with bow andshield two hundred thousand. 

{17:18} And next him [was] Jehozabad, andwith him an hundred and fourscore thousand ready prepared for the war.

{17:19} These waited on the king, beside [those] whom the king put inthe fenced cities throughout all Judah.   

{18:1} Now Jehoshaphat had riches and honour in abundance, andjoined affinity with Ahab. 

{18:2} And after [certain] years he wentdown to Ahab to Samaria. And Ahab killed sheep and oxen for him inabundance, and for the people that [he had] with him, and persuaded himto go up [with him] to Ramoth-gilead. 

{18:3} And Ahab king of Israelsaid unto Jehoshaphat king of Judah, Wilt thou go with me toRamoth-gilead? And he answered him, I [am] as thou [art,] and my peopleas thy people; and [we will be] with thee in the war.   

{18:4} And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel, Enquire, I praythee, at the word of the LORD to day. 

{18:5} Therefore the king ofIsrael gathered together of prophets four hundred men, and said untothem, Shall we go to Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall I forbear? Andthey said, Go up; for God will deliver [it] into the king's hand.

{18:6} But Jehoshaphat said, [Is there] not here a prophet of the LORDbesides, that we might enquire of him? 

{18:7} And the king of Israelsaid unto Jehoshaphat, [There is] yet one man, by whom we may enquireof the LORD: but I hate him; for he never prophesied good unto me, butalways evil: the same is Micaiah the son of Imla. And Jehoshaphat said,Let not the king say so. 

{18:8} And the king of Israel called for one[of his] officers, and said, Fetch quickly Micaiah the son of Imla.

{18:9} And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah sat eitherof them on his throne, clothed in [their] robes, and they sat in a voidplace at the entering in of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophetsprophesied before them. 

{18:10} And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah hadmade him horns of iron, and said, Thus saith the LORD, With these thoushalt push Syria until they be consumed. 

{18:11} And all the prophetsprophesied so, saying, Go up to Ramoth-gilead, and prosper: for theLORD shall deliver [it] into the hand of the king. 

{18:12} And themessenger that went to call Micaiah spake to him, saying, Behold, thewords of the prophets [declare] good to the king with one assent; letthy word therefore, I pray thee, be like one of theirs, and speak thougood. 

{18:13} And Micaiah said, [As] the LORD liveth, even what my Godsaith, that will I speak. 

{18:14} And when he was come to the king, theking said unto him, Micaiah, shall we go to Ramoth-gilead to battle, orshall I forbear? And he said, Go ye up, and prosper, and they shall bedelivered into your hand. 

{18:15} And the king said to him, How manytimes shall I adjure thee that thou say nothing but the truth to me inthe name of the LORD? 

{18:16} Then he said, I did see all Israelscattered upon the mountains, as sheep that have no shepherd: and theLORD said, These have no master; let them return [therefore] every manto his house in peace. 

{18:17} And the king of Israel said toJehoshaphat, Did I not tell thee [that] he would not prophesy good untome, but evil? 

{18:18} Again he said, Therefore hear the word of theLORD; I saw the LORD sitting upon his throne, and all the host ofheaven standing on his right hand and [on] his left. 

{18:19} And theLORD said, Who shall entice Ahab king of Israel, that he may go up andfall at Ramoth-gilead? And one spake saying after this manner, andanother saying after that manner. 

{18:20} Then there came out a spirit,and stood before the LORD, and said, I will entice him. And the LORDsaid unto him, Wherewith? 

{18:21} And he said, I will go out, and be alying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And [the LORD] said,Thou shalt entice [him,] and thou shalt also prevail: go out, and do[even] so. 

{18:22} Now therefore, behold, the LORD hath put a lyingspirit in the mouth of these thy prophets, and the LORD hath spokenevil against thee. 

{18:23} Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah camenear, and smote Micaiah upon the cheek, and said, Which way went theSpirit of the LORD from me to speak unto thee? 

{18:24} And Micaiahsaid, Behold, thou shalt see on that day when thou shalt go into aninner chamber to hide thyself. 

{18:25} Then the king of Israel said,Take ye Micaiah, and carry him back to Amon the governor of the city,and to Joash the king's son; 

{18:26} And say, Thus saith the king, Putthis [fellow] in the prison, and feed him with bread of affliction andwith water of affliction, until I return in peace. 

{18:27} And Micaiahsaid, If thou certainly return in peace, [then] hath not the LORDspoken by me. And he said, Hearken, all ye people. 

{18:28} So the kingof Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth-gilead.

{18:29} And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, I will disguisemyself, and will go to the battle; but put thou on thy robes. So theking of Israel disguised himself; and they went to the battle. 

{18:30}Now the king of Syria had commanded the captains of the chariots that[were] with him, saying, Fight ye not with small or great, save onlywith the king of Israel. 

{18:31} And it came to pass, when the captainsof the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, It [is] the king ofIsrael. Therefore they compassed about him to fight: but Jehoshaphatcried out, and the LORD helped him; and God moved them [to depart] fromhim. 

{18:32} For it came to pass, that, when the captains of thechariots perceived that it was not the king of Israel, they turned backagain from pursuing him. 

{18:33} And a [certain] man drew a bow at aventure, and smote the king of Israel between the joints of theharness: therefore he said to his chariot man, Turn thine hand, thatthou mayest carry me out of the host; for I am wounded. 

{18:34} And thebattle increased that day: howbeit the king of Israel stayed [himself]up in [his] chariot against the Syrians until the even: and about thetime of the sun going down he died.   

{19:1} And Jehoshaphat the king of Judah returned to his house inpeace to Jerusalem. 

{19:2} And Jehu the son of Hanani the seer went outto meet him, and said to king Jehoshaphat, Shouldest thou help theungodly, and love them that hate the LORD? therefore is wrath upon theefrom before the LORD. 

{19:3} Nevertheless there are good things foundin thee, in that thou hast taken away the groves out of the land, andhast prepared thine heart to seek God. 

{19:4} And Jehoshaphat dwelt atJerusalem: and he went out again through the people from Beer-sheba tomount Ephraim, and brought them back unto the LORD God of their fathers.   

{19:5} And he set judges in the land throughout all the fencedcities of Judah, city by city, 

{19:6} And said to the judges, Take heedwhat ye do: for ye judge not for man, but for the LORD, who is with youin the judgment. 

{19:7} Wherefore now let the fear of the LORD be uponyou; take heed and do [it:] for [there is] no iniquity with the LORDour God, nor respect of persons, nor taking of gifts.   

{19:8} Moreover in Jerusalem did Jehoshaphat set of the Levites, and[of] the priests, and of the chief of the fathers of Israel, for thejudgment of the LORD, and for controversies, when they returned toJerusalem. 

{19:9} And he charged them, saying, Thus shall ye do in thefear of the LORD, faithfully, and with a perfect heart. 

{19:10} Andwhat cause soever shall come to you of your brethren that dwell intheir cities, between blood and blood, between law and commandment,statutes and judgments, ye shall even warn them that they trespass notagainst the LORD, and so wrath come upon you, and upon your brethren:this do, and ye shall not trespass. 

{19:11} And, behold, Amariah thechief priest is over you in all matters of the LORD; and Zebadiah theson of Ishmael, the ruler of the house of Judah, for all the king'smatters: also the Levites [shall be] officers before you. Dealcourageously, and the LORD shall be with the good.   

{20:1} It came to pass after this also, [that] the children of Moab,and the children of Ammon, and with them [other] beside the Ammonites,came against Jehoshaphat to battle. 

{20:2} Then there came some thattold Jehoshaphat, saying, There cometh a great multitude against theefrom beyond the sea on this side Syria; and, behold, they [be]Hazazon-tamar, which [is] En-gedi. 

{20:3} And Jehoshaphat feared, andset himself to seek the LORD, and proclaimed a fast throughout allJudah. 

{20:4} And Judah gathered themselves together, to ask [help] ofthe LORD: even out of all the cities of Judah they came to seek theLORD.   

{20:5} And Jehoshaphat stood in the congregation of Judah andJerusalem, in the house of the LORD, before the new court, 

{20:6} Andsaid, O LORD God of our fathers, [art] not thou God in heaven? andrulest [not] thou over all the kingdoms of the heathen? and in thinehand [is there not] power and might, so that none is able to withstandthee? 

{20:7} [Art] not thou our God, [who] didst drive out theinhabitants of this land before thy people Israel, and gavest it to theseed of Abraham thy friend for ever? 

{20:8} And they dwelt therein, andhave built thee a sanctuary therein for thy name, saying, 

{20:9} If,[when] evil cometh upon us, [as] the sword, judgment, or pestilence, orfamine, we stand before this house, and in thy presence, (for thy name[is] in this house,) and cry unto thee in our affliction, then thouwilt hear and help. 

{20:10} And now, behold, the children of Ammon andMoab and mount Seir, whom thou wouldest not let Israel invade, whenthey came out of the land of Egypt, but they turned from them, anddestroyed them not; 

{20:11} Behold, [I say, how] they reward us, tocome to cast us out of thy possession, which thou hast given us toinherit. 

{20:12} O our God, wilt thou not judge them? for we have nomight against this great company that cometh against us; neither knowwe what to do: but our eyes [are] upon thee. 

{20:13} And all Judahstood before the LORD, with their little ones, their wives, and theirchildren.   

{20:14} Then upon Jahaziel the son of Zechariah, the son of Benaiah,the son of Jeiel, the son of Mattaniah, a Levite of the sons of Asaph,came the Spirit of the LORD in the midst of the congregation; 

{20:15}And he said, Hearken ye, all Judah, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem,and thou king Jehoshaphat, Thus saith the LORD unto you, Be not afraidnor dismayed by reason of this great multitude; for the battle [is] notyours, but God's. 

{20:16} To morrow go ye down against them: behold,they come up by the cliff of Ziz; and ye shall find them at the end ofthe brook, before the wilderness of Jeruel. 

{20:17} Ye shall not [need]to fight in this [battle:] set yourselves, stand ye [still,] and seethe salvation of the LORD with you, O Judah and Jerusalem: fear not,nor be dismayed; to morrow go out against them: for the LORD [will be]with you. 

{20:18} And Jehoshaphat bowed his head with [his] face to theground: and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem fell before theLORD, worshipping the LORD. 

{20:19} And the Levites, of the children ofthe Kohathites, and of the children of the Korhites, stood up to praisethe LORD God of Israel with a loud voice on high.   

{20:20} And they rose early in the morning, and went forth into thewilderness of Tekoa: and as they went forth, Jehoshaphat stood andsaid, Hear me, O Judah, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem; Believe in theLORD your God, so shall ye be established; believe his prophets, soshall ye prosper. 

{20:21} And when he had consulted with the people, heappointed singers unto the LORD, and that should praise the beauty ofholiness, as they went out before the army, and to say, Praise theLORD; for his mercy [endureth] for ever.   

{20:22} And when they began to sing and to praise, the LORD setambushments against the children of Ammon, Moab, and mount Seir, whichwere come against Judah; and they were smitten. 

{20:23} For thechildren of Ammon and Moab stood up against the inhabitants of mountSeir, utterly to slay and destroy [them:] and when they had made an endof the inhabitants of Seir, every one helped to destroy another.

{20:24} And when Judah came toward the watch tower in the wilderness,they looked unto the multitude, and, behold, they [were] dead bodiesfallen to the earth, and none escaped. 

{20:25} And when Jehoshaphat andhis people came to take away the spoil of them, they found among themin abundance both riches with the dead bodies, and precious jewels,which they stripped off for themselves, more than they could carryaway: and they were three days in gathering of the spoil, it was somuch.   

{20:26} And on the fourth day they assembled themselves in thevalley of Berachah; for there they blessed the LORD: therefore the nameof the same place was called, The valley of Berachah, unto this day.

{20:27} Then they returned, every man of Judah and Jerusalem, andJehoshaphat in the forefront of them, to go again to Jerusalem withjoy; for the LORD had made them to rejoice over their enemies. 

{20:28}And they came to Jerusalem with psalteries and harps and trumpets untothe house of the LORD. 

{20:29} And the fear of God was on all thekingdoms of [those] countries, when they had heard that the LORD foughtagainst the enemies of Israel. 

{20:30} So the realm of Jehoshaphat wasquiet: for his God gave him rest round about.   

{20:31} And Jehoshaphat reigned over Judah: [he was] thirty and fiveyears old when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty and five yearsin Jerusalem. And his mother's name [was] Azubah the daughter ofShilhi. 

{20:32} And he walked in the way of Asa his father, anddeparted not from it, doing [that which was] right in the sight of theLORD. 

{20:33} Howbeit the high places were not taken away: for as yetthe people had not prepared their hearts unto the God of their fathers.

{20:34} Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, first and last,behold, they [are] written in the book of Jehu the son of Hanani, whois mentioned in the book of the kings of Israel.   

{20:35} And after this did Jehoshaphat king of Judah join himselfwith Ahaziah king of Israel, who did very wickedly: 

{20:36} And hejoined himself with him to make ships to go to Tarshish: and they madethe ships in Ezion-gaber. 

{20:37} Then Eliezer the son of Dodavah ofMareshah prophesied against Jehoshaphat, saying, Because thou hastjoined thyself with Ahaziah, the LORD hath broken thy works. And theships were broken, that they were not able to go to Tarshish.   

{21:1} Now Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried withhis fathers in the city of David. And Jehoram his son reigned in hisstead. 

{21:2} And he had brethren the sons of Jehoshaphat, Azariah, andJehiel, and Zechariah, and Azariah, and Michael, and Shephatiah: allthese [were] the sons of Jehoshaphat king of Israel. 

{21:3} And theirfather gave them great gifts of silver, and of gold, and of preciousthings, with fenced cities in Judah: but the kingdom gave he toJehoram; because he [was] the firstborn. 

{21:4} Now when Jehoram wasrisen up to the kingdom of his father, he strengthened himself, andslew all his brethren with the sword, and [divers] also of the princesof Israel.   

{21:5} Jehoram [was] thirty and two years old when he began toreign, and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem. 

{21:6} And he walked inthe way of the kings of Israel, like as did the house of Ahab: for hehad the daughter of Ahab to wife: and he wrought [that which was] evilin the eyes of the LORD. 

{21:7} Howbeit the LORD would not destroy thehouse of David, because of the covenant that he had made with David,and as he promised to give a light to him and to his sons for ever.   

{21:8} In his days the Edomites revolted from under the dominion ofJudah, and made themselves a king. 

{21:9} Then Jehoram went forth withhis princes, and all his chariots with him: and he rose up by night,and smote the Edomites which compassed him in, and the captains of thechariots. 

{21:10} So the Edomites revolted from under the hand of Judahunto this day. The same time [also] did Libnah revolt from under hishand; because he had forsaken the LORD God of his fathers. 

{21:11}Moreover he made high places in the mountains of Judah, and caused theinhabitants of Jerusalem to commit fornication, and compelled Judah[thereto.]   

{21:12} And there came a writing to him from Elijah the prophet,saying, Thus saith the LORD God of David thy father, Because thou hastnot walked in the ways of Jehoshaphat thy father, nor in the ways ofAsa king of Judah, 

{21:13} But hast walked in the way of the kings ofIsrael, and hast made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to go awhoring, like to the whoredoms of the house of Ahab, and also hastslain thy brethren of thy father's house, [which were] better thanthyself: 

{21:14} Behold, with a great plague will the LORD smite thypeople, and thy children, and thy wives, and all thy goods: 

{21:15} Andthou [shalt have] great sickness by disease of thy bowels, until thybowels fall out by reason of the sickness day by day.   

{21:16} Moreover the LORD stirred up against Jehoram the spirit ofthe Philistines, and of the Arabians, that [were] near the Ethiopians:

{21:17} And they came up into Judah, and brake into it, and carriedaway all the substance that was found in the king's house, and his sonsalso, and his wives; so that there was never a son left him, saveJehoahaz, the youngest of his sons.   

{21:18} And after all this the LORD smote him in his bowels with anincurable disease. 

{21:19} And it came to pass, that in process oftime, after the end of two years, his bowels fell out by reason of hissickness: so he died of sore diseases. And his people made no burningfor him, like the burning of his fathers. 

{21:20} Thirty and two yearsold was he when he began to reign, and he reigned in Jerusalem eightyears, and departed without being desired. Howbeit they buried him inthe city of David, but not in the sepulchres of the kings.   

{22:1} And the inhabitants of Jerusalem made Ahaziah his youngestson king in his stead: for the band of men that came with the Arabiansto the camp had slain all the eldest. So Ahaziah the son of Jehoramking of Judah reigned. 

{22:2} Forty and two years old [was] Ahaziahwhen he began to reign, and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. Hismother's name also [was] Athaliah the daughter of Omri. 

{22:3} He alsowalked in the ways of the house of Ahab: for his mother was hiscounsellor to do wickedly. 

{22:4} Wherefore he did evil in the sight ofthe LORD like the house of Ahab: for they were his counsellors afterthe death of his father to his destruction.   

{22:5} He walked also after their counsel, and went with Jehoram theson of Ahab king of Israel to war against Hazael king of Syria atRamoth-gilead: and the Syrians smote Joram. 

{22:6} And he returned tobe healed in Jezreel because of the wounds which were given him atRamah, when he fought with Hazael king of Syria. And Azariah the son ofJehoram king of Judah went down to see Jehoram the son of Ahab atJezreel, because he was sick. 

{22:7} And the destruction of Ahaziah wasof God by coming to Joram: for when he was come, he went out withJehoram against Jehu the son of Nimshi, whom the LORD had anointed tocut off the house of Ahab. 

{22:8} And it came to pass, that, when Jehuwas executing judgment upon the house of Ahab, and found the princes ofJudah, and the sons of the brethren of Ahaziah, that ministered toAhaziah, he slew them. 

{22:9} And he sought Ahaziah: and they caughthim, (for he was hid in Samaria,) and brought him to Jehu: and whenthey had slain him, they buried him: Because, said they, he [is] theson of Jehoshaphat, who sought the LORD with all his heart. So thehouse of Ahaziah had no power to keep still the kingdom.   

{22:10} But when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son wasdead, she arose and destroyed all the seed royal of the house of Judah.

{22:11} But Jehoshabeath, the daughter of the king, took Joash the sonof Ahaziah, and stole him from among the king's sons that were slain,and put him and his nurse in a bedchamber. So Jehoshabeath, thedaughter of king Jehoram, the wife of Jehoiada the priest, (for she wasthe sister of Ahaziah,) hid him from Athaliah, so that she slew himnot. 

{22:12} And he was with them hid in the house of God six years:and Athaliah reigned over the land.   

{23:1} And in the seventh year Jehoiada strengthened himself, andtook the captains of hundreds, Azariah the son of Jeroham, and Ishmaelthe son of Jehohanan, and Azariah the son of Obed, and Maaseiah the sonof Adaiah, and Elishaphat the son of Zichri, into covenant with him.

{23:2} And they went about in Judah, and gathered the Levites out ofall the cities of Judah, and the chief of the fathers of Israel, andthey came to Jerusalem. 

{23:3} And all the congregation made a covenantwith the king in the house of God. And he said unto them, Behold, theking's son shall reign, as the LORD hath said of the sons of David.

{23:4} This [is] the thing that ye shall do; A third part of youentering on the sabbath, of the priests and of the Levites, [shall be]porters of the doors; 

{23:5} And a third part [shall be] at the king'shouse; and a third part at the gate of the foundation: and all thepeople [shall be] in the courts of the house of the LORD. 

{23:6} Butlet none come into the house of the LORD, save the priests, and theythat minister of the Levites; they shall go in, for they [are] holy:but all the people shall keep the watch of the LORD. 

{23:7} And theLevites shall compass the king round about, every man with his weaponsin his hand; and whosoever [else] cometh into the house, he shall beput to death: but be ye with the king when he cometh in, and when hegoeth out. 

{23:8} So the Levites and all Judah did according to allthings that Jehoiada the priest had commanded, and took every man hismen that were to come in on the sabbath, with them that were to go[out] on the sabbath: for Jehoiada the priest dismissed not thecourses. 

{23:9} Moreover Jehoiada the priest delivered to the captainsof hundreds spears, and bucklers, and shields, that [had been] kingDavid's, which [were] in the house of God. 

{23:10} And he set all thepeople, every man having his weapon in his hand, from the right side ofthe temple to the left side of the temple, along by the altar and thetemple, by the king round about. 

{23:11} Then they brought out theking's son, and put upon him the crown, and [gave him] the testimony,and made him king. And Jehoiada and his sons anointed him, and said,God save the king.   

{23:12} Now when Athaliah heard the noise of the people running andpraising the king, she came to the people into the house of the LORD:

{23:13} And she looked, and, behold, the king stood at his pillar atthe entering in, and the princes and the trumpets by the king: and allthe people of the land rejoiced, and sounded with trumpets, also thesingers with instruments of musick, and such as taught to sing praise.Then Athaliah rent her clothes, and said, Treason, Treason. 

{23:14}Then Jehoiada the priest brought out the captains of hundreds that wereset over the host, and said unto them, Have her forth of the ranges:and whoso followeth her, let him be slain with the sword. For thepriest said, Slay her not in the house of the LORD. 

{23:15} So theylaid hands on her; and when she was come to the entering of the horsegate by the king's house, they slew her there.   

{23:16} And Jehoiada made a covenant between him, and between allthe people, and between the king, that they should be the LORD'Speople. 

{23:17} Then all the people went to the house of Baal, andbrake it down, and brake his altars and his images in pieces, and slewMattan the priest of Baal before the altars. 

{23:18} Also Jehoiadaappointed the offices of the house of the LORD by the hand of thepriests the Levites, whom David had distributed in the house of theLORD, to offer the burnt offerings of the LORD, as [it is] written inthe law of Moses, with rejoicing and with singing, [as it was ordained]by David. 

{23:19} And he set the porters at the gates of the house ofthe LORD, that none [which was] unclean in any thing should enter in.

{23:20} And he took the captains of hundreds, and the nobles, and thegovernors of the people, and all the people of the land, and broughtdown the king from the house of the LORD: and they came through thehigh gate into the king's house, and set the king upon the throne ofthe kingdom. 

{23:21} And all the people of the land rejoiced: and thecity was quiet, after that they had slain Athaliah with the sword.   

{24:1} Joash [was] seven years old when he began to reign, and hereigned forty years in Jerusalem. His mother's name also [was] Zibiahof Beer-sheba. 

{24:2} And Joash did [that which was] right in the sightof the LORD all the days of Jehoiada the priest. 

{24:3} And Jehoiadatook for him two wives; and he begat sons and daughters.   

{24:4} And it came to pass after this, [that] Joash was minded torepair the house of the LORD. 

{24:5} And he gathered together thepriests and the Levites, and said to them, Go out unto the cities ofJudah, and gather of all Israel money to repair the house of your Godfrom year to year, and see that ye hasten the matter. Howbeit theLevites hastened it not. 

{24:6} And the king called for Jehoiada thechief, and said unto him, Why hast thou not required of the Levites tobring in out of Judah and out of Jerusalem the collection, [accordingto the commandment] of Moses the servant of the LORD, and of thecongregation of Israel, for the tabernacle of witness? 

{24:7} For thesons of Athaliah, that wicked woman, had broken up the house of God;and also all the dedicated things of the house of the LORD did theybestow upon Baalim. 

{24:8} And at the king's commandment they made achest, and set it without at the gate of the house of the LORD. 

{24:9}And they made a proclamation through Judah and Jerusalem, to bring into the LORD the collection [that] Moses the servant of God [laid] uponIsrael in the wilderness. 

{24:10} And all the princes and all thepeople rejoiced, and brought in, and cast into the chest, until theyhad made an end. 

{24:11} Now it came to pass, that at what time thechest was brought unto the king's office by the hand of the Levites,and when they saw that [there was] much money, the king's scribe andthe high priest's officer came and emptied the chest, and took it, andcarried it to his place again. Thus they did day by day, and gatheredmoney in abundance. 

{24:12} And the king and Jehoiada gave it to suchas did the work of the service of the house of the LORD, and hiredmasons and carpenters to repair the house of the LORD, and also such aswrought iron and brass to mend the house of the LORD. 

{24:13} So theworkmen wrought, and the work was perfected by them, and they set thehouse of God in his state, and strengthened it. 

{24:14} And when theyhad finished [it,] they brought the rest of the money before the kingand Jehoiada, whereof were made vessels for the house of the LORD,[even] vessels to minister, and to offer [withal,] and spoons, andvessels of gold and silver. And they offered burnt offerings in thehouse of the LORD continually all the days of Jehoiada.   

{24:15} But Jehoiada waxed old, and was full of days when he died;an hundred and thirty years old [was he] when he died. 

{24:16} And theyburied him in the city of David among the kings, because he had donegood in Israel, both toward God, and toward his house. 

{24:17} Nowafter the death of Jehoiada came the princes of Judah, and madeobeisance to the king. Then the king hearkened unto them. 

{24:18} Andthey left the house of the LORD God of their fathers, and served grovesand idols: and wrath came upon Judah and Jerusalem for this theirtrespass. 

{24:19} Yet he sent prophets to them, to bring them againunto the LORD; and they testified against them: but they would not giveear. 

{24:20} And the Spirit of God came upon Zechariah the son ofJehoiada the priest, which stood above the people, and said unto them,Thus saith God, Why transgress ye the commandments of the LORD, that yecannot prosper? because ye have forsaken the LORD, he hath alsoforsaken you. 

{24:21} And they conspired against him, and stoned himwith stones at the commandment of the king in the court of the house ofthe LORD. 

{24:22} Thus Joash the king remembered not the kindness whichJehoiada his father had done to him, but slew his son. And when hedied, he said, The LORD look upon [it,] and require [it.]   

{24:23} And it came to pass at the end of the year, [that] the hostof Syria came up against him: and they came to Judah and Jerusalem, anddestroyed all the princes of the people from among the people, and sentall the spoil of them unto the king of Damascus. 

{24:24} For the armyof the Syrians came with a small company of men, and the LORD delivereda very great host into their hand, because they had forsaken the LORDGod of their fathers. So they executed judgment against Joash. 

{24:25}And when they were departed from him, (for they left him in greatdiseases,) his own servants conspired against him for the blood of thesons of Jehoiada the priest, and slew him on his bed, and he died: andthey buried him in the city of David, but they buried him not in thesepulchres of the kings. 

{24:26} And these are they that conspiredagainst him; Zabad the son of Shimeath an Ammonitess, and Jehozabad theson of Shimrith a Moabitess.   

{24:27} Now [concerning] his sons, and the greatness of the burdens[laid] upon him, and the repairing of the house of God, behold, they[are] written in the story of the book of the kings. And Amaziah hisson reigned in his stead.   

{25:1} Amaziah [was] twenty and five years old [when] he began toreign, and he reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem. And hismother's name [was] Jehoaddan of Jerusalem. 

{25:2} And he did [thatwhich was] right in the sight of the LORD, but not with a perfect heart.   

{25:3} Now it came to pass, when the kingdom was established to him,that he slew his servants that had killed the king his father. 

{25:4}But he slew not their children, but [did] as [it is] written in the lawin the book of Moses, where the LORD commanded, saying, The fathersshall not die for the children, neither shall the children die for thefathers, but every man shall die for his own sin.   

{25:5} Moreover Amaziah gathered Judah together, and made themcaptains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, according to thehouses of [their] fathers, throughout all Judah and Benjamin: and henumbered them from twenty years old and above, and found them threehundred thousand choice [men, able] to go forth to war, that couldhandle spear and shield. 

{25:6} He hired also an hundred thousandmighty men of valour out of Israel for an hundred talents of silver.

{25:7} But there came a man of God to him, saying, O king, let not thearmy of Israel go with thee; for the LORD [is] not with Israel, [towit, with] all the children of Ephraim. 

{25:8} But if thou wilt go, do[it,] be strong for the battle: God shall make thee fall before theenemy: for God hath power to help, and to cast down. 

{25:9} And Amaziahsaid to the man of God, But what shall we do for the hundred talentswhich I have given to the army of Israel? And the man of God answered,The LORD is able to give thee much more than this. 

{25:10} Then Amaziahseparated them, [to wit,] the army that was come to him out of Ephraim,to go home again: wherefore their anger was greatly kindled againstJudah, and they returned home in great anger.   

{25:11} And Amaziah strengthened himself, and led forth his people,and went to the valley of salt, and smote of the children of Seir tenthousand. 

{25:12} And [other] ten thousand [left] alive did thechildren of Judah carry away captive, and brought them unto the top ofthe rock, and cast them down from the top of the rock, that they allwere broken in pieces.   

{25:13} But the soldiers of the army which Amaziah sent back, thatthey should not go with him to battle, fell upon the cities of Judah,from Samaria even unto Beth-horon, and smote three thousand of them,and took much spoil.   

{25:14} Now it came to pass, after that Amaziah was come from theslaughter of the Edomites, that he brought the gods of the children ofSeir, and set them up [to be] his gods, and bowed down himself beforethem, and burned incense unto them. 

{25:15} Wherefore the anger of theLORD was kindled against Amaziah, and he sent unto him a prophet, whichsaid unto him, Why hast thou sought after the gods of the people, whichcould not deliver their own people out of thine hand? 

{25:16} And itcame to pass, as he talked with him, that [the king] said unto him, Artthou made of the king's counsel? forbear; why shouldest thou besmitten? Then the prophet forbare, and said, I know that God hathdetermined to destroy thee, because thou hast done this, and hast nothearkened unto my counsel.   

{25:17} Then Amaziah king of Judah took advice, and sent to Joash,the son of Jehoahaz, the son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, Come, letus see one another in the face. 

{25:18} And Joash king of Israel sentto Amaziah king of Judah, saying, The thistle that [was] in Lebanonsent to the cedar that [was] in Lebanon, saying, Give thy daughter tomy son to wife: and there passed by a wild beast that [was] in Lebanon,and trode down the thistle. 

{25:19} Thou sayest, Lo, thou hast smittenthe Edomites; and thine heart lifteth thee up to boast: abide now athome; why shouldest thou meddle to [thine] hurt, that thou shouldestfall, [even] thou, and Judah with thee? 

{25:20} But Amaziah would nothear; for it [came] of God, that he might deliver them into the hand[of their enemies,] because they sought after the gods of Edom. 

{25:21}So Joash the king of Israel went up; and they saw one another in theface, [both] he and Amaziah king of Judah, at Beth- shemesh, which[belongeth] to Judah. 

{25:22} And Judah was put to the worse beforeIsrael, and they fled every man to his tent. 

{25:23} And Joash the kingof Israel took Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Joash, the son ofJehoahaz, at Beth-shemesh, and brought him to Jerusalem, and brake downthe wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim to the corner gate, fourhundred cubits. 

{25:24} And [he took] all the gold and the silver, andall the vessels that were found in the house of God with Obed-edom, andthe treasures of the king's house, the hostages also, and returned toSamaria.   

{25:25} And Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah lived after thedeath of Joash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel fifteen years. 

{25:26}Now the rest of the acts of Amaziah, first and last, behold, [are] theynot written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel?   

{25:27} Now after the time that Amaziah did turn away from followingthe LORD they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem; and he fledto Lachish: but they sent to Lachish after him, and slew him there.

{25:28} And they brought him upon horses, and buried him with hisfathers in the city of Judah.   

{26:1} Then all the people of Judah took Uzziah, who [was] sixteenyears old, and made him king in the room of his father Amaziah. 

{26:2}He built Eloth, and restored it to Judah, after that the king sleptwith his fathers. 

{26:3} Sixteen years old [was] Uzziah when he beganto reign, and he reigned fifty and two years in Jerusalem. His mother'sname also was Jecoliah of Jerusalem. 

{26:4} And he did [that which was]right in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his fatherAmaziah did. 

{26:5} And he sought God in the days of Zechariah, who hadunderstanding in the visions of God: and as long as he sought the LORD,God made him to prosper. 

{26:6} And he went forth and warred againstthe Philistines, and brake down the wall of Gath, and the wall ofJabneh, and the wall of Ashdod, and built cities about Ashdod, andamong the Philistines. 

{26:7} And God helped him against thePhilistines, and against the Arabians that dwelt in Gur-baal, and theMehunims. 

{26:8} And the Ammonites gave gifts to Uzziah: and his namespread abroad [even] to the entering in of Egypt; for he strengthened[himself] exceedingly. 

{26:9} Moreover Uzziah built towers in Jerusalemat the corner gate, and at the valley gate, and at the turning [of thewall,] and fortified them. 

{26:10} Also he built towers in the desert,and digged many wells: for he had much cattle, both in the low country,and in the plains: husbandmen [also,] and vine dressers in themountains, and in Carmel: for he loved husbandry. 

{26:11} MoreoverUzziah had an host of fighting men, that went out to war by bands,according to the number of their account by the hand of Jeiel thescribe and Maaseiah the ruler, under the hand of Hananiah, [one] of theking's captains. 

{26:12} The whole number of the chief of the fathersof the mighty men of valour [were] two thousand and six hundred.

{26:13} And under their hand [was] an army, three hundred thousand andseven thousand and five hundred, that made war with mighty power, tohelp the king against the enemy. 

{26:14} And Uzziah prepared for themthroughout all the host shields, and spears, and helmets, andhabergeons, and bows, and slings [to cast] stones. 

{26:15} And he madein Jerusalem engines, invented by cunning men, to be on the towers andupon the bulwarks, to shoot arrows and great stones withal. And hisname spread far abroad; for he was marvellously helped, till he wasstrong.   

{26:16} But when he was strong, his heart was lifted up to [his]destruction: for he transgressed against the LORD his God, and wentinto the temple of the LORD to burn incense upon the altar of incense.

{26:17} And Azariah the priest went in after him, and with himfourscore priests of the LORD, [that were] valiant men: 

{26:18} Andthey withstood Uzziah the king, and said unto him, [It appertaineth]not unto thee, Uzziah, to burn incense unto the LORD, but to thepriests the sons of Aaron, that are consecrated to burn incense: go outof the sanctuary; for thou hast trespassed; neither [shall it be] forthine honour from the LORD God. 

{26:19} Then Uzziah was wroth, and[had] a censer in his hand to burn incense: and while he was wroth withthe priests, the leprosy even rose up in his forehead before thepriests in the house of the LORD, from beside the incense altar.

{26:20} And Azariah the chief priest, and all the priests, looked uponhim, and, behold, he [was] leprous in his forehead, and they thrust himout from thence; yea, himself hasted also to go out, because the LORDhad smitten him. 

{26:21} And Uzziah the king was a leper unto the dayof his death, and dwelt in a several house, [being] a leper; for he wascut off from the house of the LORD: and Jotham his son [was] over theking's house, judging the people of the land.   

{26:22} Now the rest of the acts of Uzziah, first and last, didIsaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, write. 

{26:23} So Uzziah sleptwith his fathers, and they buried him with his fathers in the field ofthe burial which [belonged] to the kings; for they said, He [is] aleper: and Jotham his son reigned in his stead.   

{27:1} Jotham [was] twenty and five years old when he began toreign, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. His mother's namealso [was] Jerushah, the daughter of Zadok. 

{27:2} And he did [thatwhich was] right in the sight of the LORD, according to all that hisfather Uzziah did: howbeit he entered not into the temple of the LORD.And the people did yet corruptly. 

{27:3} He built the high gate of thehouse of the LORD, and on the wall of Ophel he built much. 

{27:4}Moreover he built cities in the mountains of Judah, and in the forestshe built castles and towers.   

{27:5} He fought also with the king of the Ammonites, and prevailedagainst them. And the children of Ammon gave him the same year anhundred talents of silver, and ten thousand measures of wheat, and tenthousand of barley. So much did the children of Ammon pay unto him,both the second year, and the third. 

{27:6} So Jotham became mighty,because he prepared his ways before the LORD his God.   

{27:7} Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all his wars, and hisways, lo, they [are] written in the book of the kings of Israel andJudah. 

{27:8} He was five and twenty years old when he began to reign,and reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem.   

{27:9} And Jotham slept with his fathers, and they buried him in thecity of David: and Ahaz his son reigned in his stead.   

{28:1} Ahaz [was] twenty years old when he began to reign, and hereigned sixteen years in Jerusalem: but he did not [that which was]right in the sight of the LORD, like David his father: 

{28:2} For hewalked in the ways of the kings of Israel, and made also molten imagesfor Baalim. 

{28:3} Moreover he burnt incense in the valley of the sonof Hinnom, and burnt his children in the fire, after the abominationsof the heathen whom the LORD had cast out before the children ofIsrael. 

{28:4} He sacrificed also and burnt incense in the high places,and on the hills, and under every green tree. 

{28:5} Wherefore the LORDhis God delivered him into the hand of the king of Syria; and theysmote him, and carried away a great multitude of them captives, andbrought [them] to Damascus. And he was also delivered into the hand ofthe king of Israel, who smote him with a great slaughter.   

{28:6} For Pekah the son of Remaliah slew in Judah an hundred andtwenty thousand in one day, [which were] all valiant men; because theyhad forsaken the LORD God of their fathers. 

{28:7} And Zichri, a mightyman of Ephraim, slew Maaseiah the king's son, and Azrikam the governorof the house, and Elkanah [that was] next to the king. 

{28:8} And thechildren of Israel carried away captive of their brethren two hundredthousand, women, sons, and daughters, and took also away much spoilfrom them, and brought the spoil to Samaria. 

{28:9} But a prophet ofthe LORD was there, whose name [was] Oded: and he went out before thehost that came to Samaria, and said unto them, Behold, because the LORDGod of your fathers was wroth with Judah, he hath delivered them intoyour hand, and ye have slain them in a rage [that] reacheth up untoheaven. 

{28:10} And now ye purpose to keep under the children of Judahand Jerusalem for bondmen and bondwomen unto you: [but are there] notwith you, even with you, sins against the LORD your God? 

{28:11} Nowhear me therefore, and deliver the captives again, which ye have takencaptive of your brethren: for the fierce wrath of the LORD [is] uponyou. 

{28:12} Then certain of the heads of the children of Ephraim,Azariah the son of Johanan, Berechiah the son of Meshillemoth, andJehizkiah the son of Shallum, and Amasa the son of Hadlai, stood upagainst them that came from the war, 

{28:13} And said unto them, Yeshall not bring in the captives hither: for whereas we have offendedagainst the LORD [already,] ye intend to add [more] to our sins and toour trespass: for our trespass is great, and [there is] fierce wrathagainst Israel. 

{28:14} So the armed men left the captives and thespoil before the princes and all the congregation. 

{28:15} And the menwhich were expressed by name rose up, and took the captives, and withthe spoil clothed all that were naked among them, and arrayed them, andshod them, and gave them to eat and to drink, and anointed them, andcarried all the feeble of them upon asses, and brought them to Jericho,the city of palm trees, to their brethren: then they returned toSamaria.   

{28:16} At that time did king Ahaz send unto the kings of Assyria tohelp him. 

{28:17} For again the Edomites had come and smitten Judah,and carried away captives. 

{28:18} The Philistines also had invaded thecities of the low country, and of the south of Judah, and had takenBeth-shemesh, and Ajalon, and Gederoth, and Shocho with the villagesthereof, and Timnah with the villages thereof, Gimzo also and thevillages thereof: and they dwelt there. 

{28:19} For the LORD broughtJudah low because of Ahaz king of Israel; for he made Judah naked, andtransgressed sore against the LORD. 

{28:20} And Tilgath- pilneser kingof Assyria came unto him, and distressed him, but strengthened him not.

{28:21} For Ahaz took away a portion [out] of the house of the LORD,and [out] of the house of the king, and of the princes, and gave [it]unto the king of Assyria: but he helped him not.   

{28:22} And in the time of his distress did he trespass yet moreagainst the LORD: this [is that] king Ahaz. 

{28:23} For he sacrificedunto the gods of Damascus, which smote him: and he said, Because thegods of the kings of Syria help them, [therefore] will I sacrifice tothem, that they may help me. But they were the ruin of him, and of allIsrael. 

{28:24} And Ahaz gathered together the vessels of the house ofGod, and cut in pieces the vessels of the house of God, and shut up thedoors of the house of the LORD, and he made him altars in every cornerof Jerusalem. 

{28:25} And in every several city of Judah he made highplaces to burn incense unto other gods, and provoked to anger the LORDGod of his fathers.   

{28:26} Now the rest of his acts and of all his ways, first andlast, behold, they [are] written in the book of the kings of Judah andIsrael. 

{28:27} And Ahaz slept with his fathers, and they buried him inthe city, [even] in Jerusalem: but they brought him not into thesepulchres of the kings of Israel: and Hezekiah his son reigned in hisstead.   

{29:1} Hezekiah began to reign [when he was] five and twenty yearsold, and he reigned nine and twenty years in Jerusalem. And hismother's name [was] Abijah, the daughter of Zechariah. 

{29:2} And hedid [that which was] right in the sight of the LORD, according to allthat David his father had done.   

{29:3} He in the first year of his reign, in the first month, openedthe doors of the house of the LORD, and repaired them. 

{29:4} And hebrought in the priests and the Levites, and gathered them together intothe east street, 

{29:5} And said unto them, Hear me, ye Levites,sanctify now yourselves, and sanctify the house of the LORD God of yourfathers, and carry forth the filthiness out of the holy [place. ]

{29:6}For our fathers have trespassed, and done [that which was] evil in theeyes of the LORD our God, and have forsaken him, and have turned awaytheir faces from the habitation of the LORD, and turned [their] backs.

{29:7} Also they have shut up the doors of the porch, and put out thelamps, and have not burned incense nor offered burnt offerings in theholy [place] unto the God of Israel. 

{29:8} Wherefore the wrath of theLORD was upon Judah and Jerusalem, and he hath delivered them totrouble, to astonishment, and to hissing, as ye see with your eyes.

{29:9} For, lo, our fathers have fallen by the sword, and our sons andour daughters and our wives are in captivity for this. 

{29:10} Now [itis] in mine heart to make a covenant with the LORD God of Israel, thathis fierce wrath may turn away from us. 

{29:11} My sons, be not nownegligent: for the LORD hath chosen you to stand before him, to servehim, and that ye should minister unto him, and burn incense.   

{29:12} Then the Levites arose, Mahath the son of Amasai, and Joelthe son of Azariah, of the sons of the Kohathites: and of the sons ofMerari, Kish the son of Abdi, and Azariah the son of Jehalelel: and ofthe Gershonites; Joah the son of Zimmah, and Eden the son of Joah:

{29:13} And of the sons of Elizaphan; Shimri, and Jeiel: and of thesons of Asaph; Zechariah, and Mattaniah: 

{29:14} And of the sons ofHeman; Jehiel, and Shimei: and of the sons of Jeduthun; Shemaiah, andUzziel. 

{29:15} And they gathered their brethren, and sanctifiedthemselves, and came, according to the commandment of the king, by thewords of the LORD, to cleanse the house of the LORD. 

{29:16} And thepriests went into the inner part of the house of the LORD, to cleanse[it,] and brought out all the uncleanness that they found in the templeof the LORD into the court of the house of the LORD. And the Levitestook [it,] to carry [it] out abroad into the brook Kidron. 

{29:17} Nowthey began on the first [day] of the first month to sanctify, and onthe eighth day of the month came they to the porch of the LORD: so theysanctified the house of the LORD in eight days; and in the sixteenthday of the first month they made an end. 

{29:18} Then they went in toHezekiah the king, and said, We have cleansed all the house of theLORD, and the altar of burnt offering, with all the vessels thereof,and the shewbread table, with all the vessels thereof. 

{29:19} Moreoverall the vessels, which king Ahaz in his reign did cast away in histransgression, have we prepared and sanctified, and, behold, they [are]before the altar of the LORD.   

{29:20} Then Hezekiah the king rose early, and gathered the rulersof the city, and went up to the house of the LORD. 

{29:21} And theybrought seven bullocks, and seven rams, and seven lambs, and seven hegoats, for a sin offering for the kingdom, and for the sanctuary, andfor Judah. And he commanded the priests the sons of Aaron to offer[them] on the altar of the LORD. 

{29:22} So they killed the bullocks,and the priests received the blood, and sprinkled [it] on the altar:likewise, when they had killed the rams, they sprinkled the blood uponthe altar: they killed also the lambs, and they sprinkled the bloodupon the altar. 

{29:23} And they brought forth the he goats [for] thesin offering before the king and the congregation; and they laid theirhands upon them: 

{29:24} And the priests killed them, and they madereconciliation with their blood upon the altar, to make an atonementfor all Israel: for the king commanded [that] the burnt offering andthe sin offering [should be made] for all Israel. 

{29:25} And he setthe Levites in the house of the LORD with cymbals, with psalteries, andwith harps, according to the commandment of David, and of Gad theking's seer, and Nathan the prophet: for [so was] the commandment ofthe LORD by his prophets. 

{29:26} And the Levites stood with theinstruments of David, and the priests with the trumpets. 

{29:27} AndHezekiah commanded to offer the burnt offering upon the altar. And whenthe burnt offering began, the song of the LORD began [also] with thetrumpets, and with the instruments [ordained] by David king of Israel.

{29:28} And all the congregation worshipped, and the singers sang, andthe trumpeters sounded: [and] all [this continued] until the burntoffering was finished. 

{29:29} And when they had made an end ofoffering, the king and all that were present with him bowed themselves,and worshipped. 

{29:30} Moreover Hezekiah the king and the princescommanded the Levites to sing praise unto the LORD with the words ofDavid, and of Asaph the seer. And they sang praises with gladness, andthey bowed their heads and worshipped. 

{29:31} Then Hezekiah answeredand said, Now ye have consecrated yourselves unto the LORD, come nearand bring sacrifices and thank offerings into the house of the LORD.And the congregation brought in sacrifices and thank offerings; and asmany as were of a free heart burnt offerings. 

{29:32} And the number ofthe burnt offerings, which the congregation brought, was threescore andten bullocks, an hundred rams, [and] two hundred lambs: all these[were] for a burnt offering to the LORD. 

{29:33} And the consecratedthings [were] six hundred oxen and three thousand sheep. 

{29:34} Butthe priests were too few, so that they could not flay all the burntofferings: wherefore their brethren the Levites did help them, till thework was ended, and until the [other] priests had sanctifiedthemselves: for the Levites [were] more upright in heart to sanctifythemselves than the priests. 

{29:35} And also the burnt offerings[were] in abundance,with the fat of the peace offerings, and the drinkofferings for [every] burnt offering. So the service of the house ofthe LORD was set in order. 

{29:36} And Hezekiah rejoiced, and all thepeople, that God had prepared the people: for the thing was [done]suddenly.   

{30:1} And Hezekiah sent to all Israel and Judah, and wrote lettersalso to Ephraim and Manasseh, that they should come to the house of theLORD at Jerusalem, to keep the passover unto the LORD God of Israel.

{30:2} For the king had taken counsel, and his princes, and all thecongregation in Jerusalem, to keep the passover in the second month.

{30:3} For they could not keep it at that time, because the priests hadnot sanctified themselves sufficiently, neither had the people gatheredthemselves together to Jerusalem. 

{30:4} And the thing pleased the kingand all the congregation. 

{30:5} So they established a decree to makeproclamation throughout all Israel, from Beer-sheba even to Dan, thatthey should come to keep the passover unto the LORD God of Israel atJerusalem: for they had not done [it] of a long [time in such sort] asit was written. 

{30:6} So the posts went with the letters from the kingand his princes throughout all Israel and Judah, and according to thecommandment of the king, saying, Ye children of Israel, turn again untothe LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, and he will return to theremnant of you, that are escaped out of the hand of the kings ofAssyria. 

{30:7} And be not ye like your fathers, and like yourbrethren, which trespassed against the LORD God of their fathers, [who]therefore gave them up to desolation, as ye see. 

{30:8} Now be ye notstiffnecked, as your fathers [were, but] yield yourselves unto theLORD, and enter into his sanctuary, which he hath sanctified for ever:and serve the LORD your God, that the fierceness of his wrath may turnaway from you. 

{30:9} For if ye turn again unto the LORD, your brethrenand your children [shall find] compassion before them that lead themcaptive, so that they shall come again into this land: for the LORDyour God [is] gracious and merciful, and will not turn away [his] facefrom you, if ye return unto him. 

{30:10} So the posts passed from cityto city through the country of Ephraim and Manasseh even unto Zebulun:but they laughed them to scorn, and mocked them. 

{30:11} Neverthelessdivers of Asher and Manasseh and of Zebulun humbled themselves, andcame to Jerusalem. 

{30:12} Also in Judah the hand of God was to givethem one heart to do the commandment of the king and of the princes, bythe word of the LORD.   

{30:13} And there assembled at Jerusalem much people to keep thefeast of unleavened bread in the second month, a very greatcongregation. 

{30:14} And they arose and took away the altars that[were] in Jerusalem, and all the altars for incense took they away, andcast [them] into the brook Kidron. 

{30:15} Then they killed thepassover on the fourteenth [day] of the second month: and the priestsand the Levites were ashamed, and sanctified themselves, and brought inthe burnt offerings into the house of the LORD. 

{30:16} And they stoodin their place after their manner, according to the law of Moses theman of God: the priests sprinkled the blood, [which they received] ofthe hand of the Levites. 

{30:17} For [there were] many in thecongregation that were not sanctified: therefore the Levites had thecharge of the killing of the passovers for every one [that was] notclean, to sanctify [them] unto the LORD. 

{30:18} For a multitude of thepeople, [even] many of Ephraim, and Manasseh, Issachar, and Zebulun,had not cleansed themselves, yet did they eat the passover otherwisethan it was written. But Hezekiah prayed for them, saying, The goodLORD pardon every one 

{30:19} [That] prepareth his heart to seek God,the LORD God of his fathers, though [he be] not [cleansed] according tothe purification of the sanctuary. 

{30:20} And the LORD hearkened toHezekiah, and healed the people. 

{30:21} And the children of Israelthat were present at Jerusalem kept the feast of unleavened bread sevendays with great gladness: and the Levites and the priests praised theLORD day by day, [singing] with loud instruments unto the LORD. 

{30:22}And Hezekiah spake comfortably unto all the Levites that taught thegood knowledge of the LORD: and they did eat throughout the feast sevendays, offering peace offerings, and making confession to the LORD Godof their fathers. 

{30:23} And the whole assembly took counsel to keepother seven days: and they kept [other] seven days with gladness.

{30:24} For Hezekiah king of Judah did give to the congregation athousand bullocks and seven thousand sheep; and the princes gave to thecongregation a thousand bullocks and ten thousand sheep: and a greatnumber of priests sanctified themselves. 

{30:25} And all thecongregation of Judah, with the priests and the Levites, and all thecongregation that came out of Israel, and the strangers that came outof the land of Israel, and that dwelt in Judah, rejoiced. 

{30:26} Sothere was great joy in Jerusalem: for since the time of Solomon the sonof David king of Israel [there was] not the like in Jerusalem.   

{30:27} Then the priests the Levites arose and blessed the people:and their voice was heard, and their prayer came [up] to his holydwelling place, [even] unto heaven.   

{31:1} Now when all this was finished, all Israel that were presentwent out to the cities of Judah, and brake the images in pieces, andcut down the groves, and threw down the high places and the altars outof all Judah and Benjamin, in Ephraim also and Manasseh, until they hadutterly destroyed them all. Then all the children of Israel returned,every man to his possession, into their own cities.   

{31:2} And Hezekiah appointed the courses of the priests and theLevites after their courses, every man according to his service, thepriests and Levites for burnt offerings and for peace offerings, tominister, and to give thanks, and to praise in the gates of the tentsof the LORD. 

{31:3} [He appointed] also the king's portion of hissubstance for the burnt offerings, [to wit,] for the morning andevening burnt offerings, and the burnt offerings for the sabbaths, andfor the new moons, and for the set feasts, as [it is] written in thelaw of the LORD. 

{31:4} Moreover he commanded the people that dwelt inJerusalem to give the portion of the priests and the Levites, that theymight be encouraged in the law of the LORD.   

{31:5} And as soon as the commandment came abroad, the children ofIsrael brought in abundance the firstfruits of corn, wine, and oil, andhoney, and of all the increase of the field; and the tithe of all[things] brought they in abundantly. 

{31:6} And [concerning] thechildren of Israel and Judah, that dwelt in the cities of Judah, theyalso brought in the tithe of oxen and sheep, and the tithe of holythings which were consecrated unto the LORD their God, and laid [them]by heaps. 

{31:7} In the third month they began to lay the foundation ofthe heaps, and finished [them] in the seventh month. 

{31:8} And whenHezekiah and the princes came and saw the heaps, they blessed the LORD,and his people Israel. 

{31:9} Then Hezekiah questioned with the priestsand the Levites concerning the heaps. 

{31:10} And Azariah the chiefpriest of the house of Zadok answered him, and said, Since [the people]began to bring the offerings into the house of the LORD, we have hadenough to eat, and have left plenty: for the LORD hath blessed hispeople; and that which is left [is] this great store.   

{31:11} Then Hezekiah commanded to prepare chambers in the house ofthe LORD; and they prepared [them, ]

{31:12} And brought in theofferings and the tithes and the dedicated [things] faithfully: overwhich Cononiah the Levite [was] ruler, and Shimei his brother [was] thenext. 

{31:13} And Jehiel, and Azaziah, and Nahath, and Asahel, andJerimoth, and Jozabad, and Eliel, and Ismachiah, and Mahath, andBenaiah, [were] overseers under the hand of Cononiah and Shimei hisbrother, at the commandment of Hezekiah the king, and Azariah the rulerof the house of God. 

{31:14} And Kore the son of Imnah the Levite, theporter toward the east, [was] over the freewill offerings of God, todistribute the oblations of the LORD, and the most holy things. 

{31:15}And next him [were] Eden, and Miniamin, and Jeshua, and Shemaiah,Amariah, and Shecaniah, in the cities of the priests, in [their] setoffice, to give to their brethren by courses, as well to the great asto the small: 

{31:16} Beside their genealogy of males, from three yearsold and upward, [even] unto every one that entereth into the house ofthe LORD, his daily portion for their service in their chargesaccording to their courses; 

{31:17} Both to the genealogy of thepriests by the house of their fathers, and the Levites from twentyyears old and upward, in their charges by their courses; 

{31:18} And tothe genealogy of all their little ones, their wives, and their sons,and their daughters, through all the congregation: for in their setoffice they sanctified themselves in holiness: 

{31:19} Also of the sonsof Aaron the priests, [which were] in the fields of the suburbs oftheir cities, in every several city, the men that were expressed byname, to give portions to all the males among the priests, and to allthat were reckoned by genealogies among the Levites.   

{31:20} And thus did Hezekiah throughout all Judah, and wrought[that which was] good and right and truth before the LORD his God.

{31:21} And in every work that he began in the service of the house ofGod, and in the law, and in the commandments, to seek his God, he did[it] with all his heart, and prospered.   

{32:1} After these things, and the establishment thereof,Sennacherib king of Assyria came, and entered into Judah, and encampedagainst the fenced cities, and thought to win them for himself. 

{32:2}And when Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib was come, and that he waspurposed to fight against Jerusalem, 

{32:3} He took counsel with hisprinces and his mighty men to stop the waters of the fountains which[were] without the city: and they did help him. 

{32:4} So there wasgathered much people together, who stopped all the fountains, and thebrook that ran through the midst of the land, saying, Why should thekings of Assyria come, and find much water? 

{32:5} Also he strengthenedhimself, and built up all the wall that was broken, and raised [it] upto the towers, and another wall without, and repaired Millo [in] thecity of David, and made darts and shields in abundance. 

{32:6} And heset captains of war over the people, and gathered them together to himin the street of the gate of the city, and spake comfortably to them,saying, 

{32:7} Be strong and courageous, be not afraid nor dismayed forthe king of Assyria, nor for all the multitude that [is] with him: for[there be] more with us than with him: 

{32:8} With him [is] an arm offlesh; but with us [is] the LORD our God to help us, and to fight ourbattles. And the people rested themselves upon the words of Hezekiahking of Judah.   

{32:9} After this did Sennacherib king of Assyria send his servantsto Jerusalem, (but he [himself laid siege] against Lachish, and all hispower with him,) unto Hezekiah king of Judah, and unto all Judah that[were] at Jerusalem, saying, 

{32:10} Thus saith Sennacherib king ofAssyria, Whereon do ye trust, that ye abide in the siege in Jerusalem?

{32:11} Doth not Hezekiah persuade you to give over yourselves to dieby famine and by thirst, saying, The LORD our God shall deliver us outof the hand of the king of Assyria? 

{32:12} Hath not the same Hezekiahtaken away his high places and his altars, and commanded Judah andJerusalem, saying, Ye shall worship before one altar, and burn incenseupon it? 

{32:13} Know ye not what I and my fathers have done unto allthe people of [other] lands? were the gods of the nations of thoselands any ways able to deliver their lands out of mine hand? 

{32:14}Who [was there] among all the gods of those nations that my fathersutterly destroyed, that could deliver his people out of mine hand, thatyour God should be able to deliver you out of mine hand? 

{32:15} Nowtherefore let not Hezekiah deceive you, nor persuade you on thismanner, neither yet believe him: for no god of any nation or kingdomwas able to deliver his people out of mine hand, and out of the hand ofmy fathers: how much less shall your God deliver you out of mine hand?

{32:16} And his servants spake yet [more] against the LORD God, andagainst his servant Hezekiah. 

{32:17} He wrote also letters to rail onthe LORD God of Israel, and to speak against him, saying, As the godsof the nations of [other] lands have not delivered their people out ofmine hand, so shall not the God of Hezekiah deliver his people out ofmine hand. 

{32:18} Then they cried with a loud voice in the Jews'speech unto the people of Jerusalem that [were] on the wall, toaffright them, and to trouble them; that they might take the city.

{32:19} And they spake against the God of Jerusalem, as against thegods of the people of the earth, [which were] the work of the hands ofman. 

{32:20} And for this [cause] Hezekiah the king, and the prophetIsaiah the son of Amoz, prayed and cried to heaven.   

{32:21} And the LORD sent an angel, which cut off all the mighty menof valour, and the leaders and captains in the camp of the king ofAssyria. So he returned with shame of face to his own land. And when hewas come into the house of his god, they that came forth of his ownbowels slew him there with the sword. 

{32:22} Thus the LORD savedHezekiah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem from the hand of Sennacheribthe king of Assyria, and from the hand of all [other,] and guided themon every side. 

{32:23} And many brought gifts unto the LORD toJerusalem, and presents to Hezekiah king of Judah: so that he wasmagnified in the sight of all nations from thenceforth.   

{32:24} In those days Hezekiah was sick to the death, and prayedunto the LORD: and he spake unto him, and he gave him a sign. 

{32:25}But Hezekiah rendered not again according to the benefit [done] untohim; for his heart was lifted up: therefore there was wrath upon him,and upon Judah and Jerusalem. 

{32:26} Notwithstanding Hezekiah humbledhimself for the pride of his heart, [both] he and the inhabitants ofJerusalem, so that the wrath of the LORD came not upon them in the daysof Hezekiah.   

{32:27} And Hezekiah had exceeding much riches and honour: and hemade himself treasuries for silver, and for gold, and for preciousstones, and for spices, and for shields, and for all manner of pleasantjewels; 

{32:28} Storehouses also for the increase of corn, and wine,and oil; and stalls for all manner of beasts, and cotes for flocks.

{32:29} Moreover he provided him cities, and possessions of flocks andherds in abundance: for God had given him substance very much. 

{32:30}This same Hezekiah also stopped the upper watercourse of Gihon, andbrought it straight down to the west side of the city of David. AndHezekiah prospered in all his works.   

{32:31} Howbeit in [the business of] the ambassadors of the princesof Babylon, who sent unto him to enquire of the wonder that was [done]in the land, God left him, to try him, that he might know all [thatwas] in his heart.   

{32:32} Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and his goodness,behold, they [are] written in the vision of Isaiah the prophet, the sonof Amoz, [and] in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel. 

{32:33}And Hezekiah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in thechiefest of the sepulchres of the sons of David: and all Judah and theinhabitants of Jerusalem did him honour at his death. And Manasseh hisson reigned in his stead.   

{33:1} Manasseh [was] twelve years old when he began to reign, andhe reigned fifty and five years in Jerusalem: 

{33:2} But did [thatwhich was] evil in the sight of the LORD, like unto the abominations ofthe heathen, whom the LORD had cast out before the children of Israel.   

{33:3} For he built again the high places which Hezekiah his fatherhad broken down, and he reared up altars for Baalim, and made groves,and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served them. 

{33:4} Also hebuilt altars in the house of the LORD, whereof the LORD had said, InJerusalem shall my name be for ever. 

{33:5} And he built altars for allthe host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the LORD. 

{33:6}And he caused his children to pass through the fire in the valley ofthe son of Hinnom: also he observed times, and used enchantments, andused witchcraft, and dealt with a familiar spirit, and with wizards: hewrought much evil in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger.

{33:7} And he set a carved image, the idol which he had made, in thehouse of God, of which God had said to David and to Solomon his son, Inthis house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen before all the tribesof Israel, will I put my name for ever: 

{33:8} Neither will I any moreremove the foot of Israel from out of the land which I have appointedfor your fathers; so that they will take heed to do all that I havecommanded them, according to the whole law and the statutes and theordinances by the hand of Moses. 

{33:9} So Manasseh made Judah and theinhabitants of Jerusalem to err, [and] to do worse than the heathen,whom the LORD had destroyed before the children of Israel. 

{33:10} Andthe LORD spake to Manasseh, and to his people: but they would nothearken.   

{33:11} Wherefore the LORD brought upon them the captains of thehost of the king of Assyria, which took Manasseh among the thorns, andbound him with fetters, and carried him to Babylon. 

{33:12} And when hewas in affliction, he besought the LORD his God, and humbled himselfgreatly before the God of his fathers, 

{33:13} And prayed unto him: andhe was intreated of him, and heard his supplication, and brought himagain to Jerusalem into his kingdom. Then Manasseh knew that the LORDhe [was] God. 

{33:14} Now after this he built a wall without the cityof David, on the west side of Gihon, in the valley, even to theentering in at the fish gate, and compassed about Ophel, and raised itup a very great height, and put captains of war in all the fencedcities of Judah. 

{33:15} And he took away the strange gods, and theidol out of the house of the LORD, and all the altars that he had builtin the mount of the house of the LORD, and in Jerusalem, and cast[them] out of the city. 

{33:16} And he repaired the altar of the LORD,and sacrificed thereon peace offerings and thank offerings, andcommanded Judah to serve the LORD God of Israel. 

{33:17} Neverthelessthe people did sacrifice still in the high places, yet unto the LORDtheir God only.   

{33:18} Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and his prayer untohis God, and the words of the seers that spake to him in the name ofthe LORD God of Israel, behold, they [are written] in the book of thekings of Israel. 

{33:19} His prayer also, and [how God] was intreatedof him, and all his sin, and his trespass, and the places wherein hebuilt high places, and set up groves and graven images, before he washumbled: behold, they [are] written among the sayings of the seers.   

{33:20} So Manasseh slept with his fathers, and they buried him inhis own house: and Amon his son reigned in his stead.   

{33:21} Amon [was] two and twenty years old when he began to reign,and reigned two years in Jerusalem. 

{33:22} But he did [that which was]evil in the sight of the LORD, as did Manasseh his father: for Amonsacrificed unto all the carved images which Manasseh his father hadmade, and served them; 

{33:23} And humbled not himself before the LORD,as Manasseh his father had humbled himself; but Amon trespassed moreand more. 

{33:24} And his servants conspired against him, and slew himin his own house.   

{33:25} But the people of the land slew all them that had conspiredagainst king Amon; and the people of the land made Josiah his son kingin his stead.   

{34:1} Josiah [was] eight years old when he began to reign, and hereigned in Jerusalem one and thirty years. 

{34:2} And he did [thatwhich was] right in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the ways ofDavid his father, and declined [neither] to the right hand, nor to theleft.   

{34:3} For in the eighth year of his reign, while he was yet young,he began to seek after the God of David his father: and in the twelfthyear he began to purge Judah and Jerusalem from the high places, andthe groves, and the carved images, and the molten images. 

{34:4} Andthey brake down the altars of Baalim in his presence; and the images,that [were] on high above them, he cut down; and the groves, and thecarved images, and the molten images, he brake in pieces, and made dust[of them,] and strowed [it] upon the graves of them that had sacrificedunto them. 

{34:5} And he burnt the bones of the priests upon theiraltars, and cleansed Judah and Jerusalem. 

{34:6} And [so did he] in thecities of Manasseh, and Ephraim, and Simeon, even unto Naphtali, withtheir mattocks round about. 

{34:7} And when he had broken down thealtars and the groves, and had beaten the graven images into powder,and cut down all the idols throughout all the land of Israel, hereturned to Jerusalem.   

{34:8} Now in the eighteenth year of his reign, when he had purgedthe land, and the house, he sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, andMaaseiah the governor of the city, and Joah the son of Joahaz therecorder, to repair the house of the LORD his God. 

{34:9} And when theycame to Hilkiah the high priest, they delivered the money that wasbrought into the house of God, which the Levites that kept the doorshad gathered of the hand of Manasseh and Ephraim, and of all theremnant of Israel, and of all Judah and Benjamin; and they returned toJerusalem. 

{34:10} And they put [it] in the hand of the workmen thathad the oversight of the house of the LORD, and they gave it to theworkmen that wrought in the house of the LORD, to repair and amend thehouse: 

{34:11} Even to the artificers and builders gave they [it,] tobuy hewn stone, and timber for couplings, and to floor the houses whichthe kings of Judah had destroyed. 

{34:12} And the men did the workfaithfully: and the overseers of them [were] Jahath and Obadiah, theLevites, of the sons of Merari; and Zechariah and Meshullam, of thesons of the Kohathites, to set [it] forward; and [other of] theLevites, all that could skill of instruments of musick. 

{34:13} Also[they were] over the bearers of burdens, and [were] overseers of allthat wrought the work in any manner of service: and of the Levites[there were] scribes, and officers, and porters.   

{34:14} And when they brought out the money that was brought intothe house of the LORD, Hilkiah the priest found a book of the law ofthe LORD [given] by Moses. 

{34:15} And Hilkiah answered and said toShaphan the scribe, I have found the book of the law in the house ofthe LORD. And Hilkiah delivered the book to Shaphan. 

{34:16} AndShaphan carried the book to the king, and brought the king word backagain, saying, All that was committed to thy servants, they do [it.]

{34:17} And they have gathered together the money that was found inthe house of the LORD, and have delivered it into the hand of theoverseers, and to the hand of the workmen. 

{34:18} Then Shaphan thescribe told the king, saying, Hilkiah the priest hath given me a book.And Shaphan read it before the king. 

{34:19} And it came to pass, whenthe king had heard the words of the law, that he rent his clothes.

{34:20} And the king commanded Hilkiah, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan,and Abdon the son of Micah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah aservant of the king's, saying, 

{34:21} Go, enquire of the LORD for me,and for them that are left in Israel and in Judah, concerning the wordsof the book that is found: for great [is] the wrath of the LORD that ispoured out upon us, because our fathers have not kept the word of theLORD, to do after all that is written in this book. 

{34:22} AndHilkiah, and [they] that the king [had appointed,] went to Huldah theprophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvath, the son of Hasrah,keeper of the wardrobe; (now she dwelt in Jerusalem in the college:)and they spake to her to that [effect.]   

{34:23} And she answered them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel,Tell ye the man that sent you to me, 

{34:24} Thus saith the LORD,Behold, I will bring evil upon this place, and upon the inhabitantsthereof, [even] all the curses that are written in the book which theyhave read before the king of Judah: 

{34:25} Because they have forsakenme, and have burned incense unto other gods, that they might provoke meto anger with all the works of their hands; therefore my wrath shall bepoured out upon this place, and shall not be quenched. 

{34:26} And asfor the king of Judah, who sent you to enquire of the LORD, so shall yesay unto him, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel [concerning] the wordswhich thou hast heard; 

{34:27} Because thine heart was tender, and thoudidst humble thyself before God, when thou heardest his words againstthis place, and against the inhabitants thereof, and humbledst thyselfbefore me, and didst rend thy clothes, and weep before me; I have evenheard [thee] also, saith the LORD. 

{34:28} Behold, I will gather theeto thy fathers, and thou shalt be gathered to thy grave in peace,neither shall thine eyes see all the evil that I will bring upon thisplace, and upon the inhabitants of the same. So they brought the kingword again.   

{34:29} Then the king sent and gathered together all the elders ofJudah and Jerusalem. 

{34:30} And the king went up into the house of theLORD, and all the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, andthe priests, and the Levites, and all the people, great and small: andhe read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant thatwas found in the house of the LORD. 

{34:31} And the king stood in hisplace, and made a covenant before the LORD, to walk after the LORD, andto keep his commandments, and his testimonies, and his statutes, withall his heart, and with all his soul, to perform the words of thecovenant which are written in this book. 

{34:32} And he caused all thatwere present in Jerusalem and Benjamin to stand [to it.] And theinhabitants of Jerusalem did according to the covenant of God, the Godof their fathers. 

{34:33} And Josiah took away all the abominations outof all the countries that [pertained] to the children of Israel, andmade all that were present in Israel to serve, [even] to serve the LORDtheir God. [And] all his days they departed not from following theLORD, the God of their fathers.   

{35:1} Moreover Josiah kept a passover unto the LORD in Jerusalem:and they killed the passover on the fourteenth [day] of the firstmonth. 

{35:2} And he set the priests in their charges, and encouragedthem to the service of the house of the LORD, 

{35:3} And said unto theLevites that taught all Israel, which were holy unto the LORD, Put theholy ark in the house which Solomon the son of David king of Israel didbuild; [it shall] not [be] a burden upon [your] shoulders: serve nowthe LORD your God, and his people Israel, 

{35:4} And prepare[yourselves] by the houses of your fathers, after your courses,according to the writing of David king of Israel, and according to thewriting of Solomon his son. 

{35:5} And stand in the holy [place]according to the divisions of the families of the fathers of yourbrethren the people, and [after] the division of the families of theLevites. 

{35:6} So kill the passover, and sanctify yourselves, andprepare your brethren, that [they] may do according to the word of theLORD by the hand of Moses. 

{35:7} And Josiah gave to the people, of theflock, lambs and kids, all for the passover offerings, for all thatwere present, to the number of thirty thousand, and three thousandbullocks: these [were] of the king's substance. 

{35:8} And his princesgave willingly unto the people, to the priests, and to the Levites:Hilkiah and Zechariah and Jehiel, rulers of the house of God, gave untothe priests for the passover offerings two thousand and six hundred[small cattle,] and three hundred oxen. 

{35:9} Conaniah also, andShemaiah and Nethaneel, his brethren, and Hashabiah and Jeiel andJozabad, chief of the Levites, gave unto the Levites for passoverofferings five thousand [small cattle,] and five hundred oxen. 

{35:10}So the service was prepared, and the priests stood in their place, andthe Levites in their courses, according to the king's commandment.

{35:11} And they killed the passover, and the priests sprinkled [theblood] from their hands, and the Levites flayed [them. ]

{35:12} Andthey removed the burnt offerings, that they might give according to thedivisions of the families of the people, to offer unto the LORD, as [itis] written in the book of Moses. And so [did they] with the oxen.

{35:13} And they roasted the passover with fire according to theordinance: but the [other] holy [offerings] sod they in pots, and incaldrons, and in pans, and divided [them] speedily among all thepeople. 

{35:14} And afterward they made ready for themselves, and forthe priests: because the priests the sons of Aaron [were busied] inoffering of burnt offerings and the fat until night; therefore theLevites prepared for themselves, and for the priests the sons of Aaron.

{35:15} And the singers the sons of Asaph [were] in their place,according to the commandment of David, and Asaph, and Heman, andJeduthun the king's seer; and the porters [waited] at every gate; theymight not depart from their service; for their brethren the Levitesprepared for them. 

{35:16} So all the service of the LORD was preparedthe same day, to keep the passover, and to offer burnt offerings uponthe altar of the LORD, according to the commandment of king Josiah.

{35:17} And the children of Israel that were present kept the passoverat that time, and the feast of unleavened bread seven days. 

{35:18} Andthere was no passover like to that kept in Israel from the days ofSamuel the prophet; neither did all the kings of Israel keep such apassover as Josiah kept, and the priests, and the Levites, and allJudah and Israel that were present, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.

{35:19} In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah was this passoverkept.   

{35:20} After all this, when Josiah had prepared the temple, Nechoking of Egypt came up to fight against Charchemish by Euphrates: andJosiah went out against him. 

{35:21} But he sent ambassadors to him,saying, What have I to do with thee, thou king of Judah? [I come] notagainst thee this day, but against the house wherewith I have war: forGod commanded me to make haste: forbear thee from [meddling with] God,who [is] with me, that he destroy thee not. 

{35:22} Nevertheless Josiahwould not turn his face from him, but disguised himself, that he mightfight with him, and hearkened not unto the words of Necho from themouth of God, and came to fight in the valley of Megiddo. 

{35:23} Andthe archers shot at king Josiah; and the king said to his servants,Have me away; for I am sore wounded. 

{35:24} His servants thereforetook him out of that chariot, and put him in the second chariot that hehad; and they brought him to Jerusalem, and he died, and was buried in[one of] the sepulchres of his fathers. And all Judah and Jerusalemmourned for Josiah.   

{35:25} And Jeremiah lamented for Josiah: and all the singing menand the singing women spake of Josiah in their lamentations to thisday, and made them an ordinance in Israel: and, behold, they [are]written in the lamentations. 

{35:26} Now the rest of the acts ofJosiah, and his goodness, according to [that which was] written in thelaw of the LORD, 

{35:27} And his deeds, first and last, behold, they[are] written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah.   

{36:1} Then the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah,and made him king in his father's stead in Jerusalem. 

{36:2} Jehoahaz[was] twenty and three years old when he began to reign, and he reignedthree months in Jerusalem. 

{36:3} And the king of Egypt put him down atJerusalem, and condemned the land in an hundred talents of silver and atalent of gold.   

{36:4} And the king of Egypt made Eliakim his brother king overJudah and Jerusalem, and turned his name to Jehoiakim. And Necho tookJehoahaz his brother, and carried him to Egypt. 

{36:5} Jehoiakim [was]twenty and five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned elevenyears in Jerusalem: and he did [that which was] evil in the sight ofthe LORD his God. 

{36:6} Against him came up Nebuchadnezzar king ofBabylon, and bound him in fetters, to carry him to Babylon. 

{36:7}Nebuchadnezzar also carried of the vessels of the house of the LORD toBabylon, and put them in his temple at Babylon. 

{36:8} Now the rest ofthe acts of Jehoiakim, and his abominations which he did, and thatwhich was found in him, behold, they [are] written in the book of thekings of Israel and Judah: and Jehoiachin his son reigned in his stead.

{36:9} Jehoiachin [was] eight years old when he began to reign, and hereigned three months and ten days in Jerusalem: and he did [that whichwas] evil in the sight of the LORD. 

{36:10} And when the year wasexpired, king Nebuchadnezzar sent, and brought him to Babylon, with thegoodly vessels of the house of the LORD, and made Zedekiah his brotherking over Judah and Jerusalem.   

{36:11} Zedekiah [was] one and twenty years old when he began toreign, and reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. 

{36:12} And he did [thatwhich was] evil in the sight of the LORD his God, [and] humbled nothimself before Jeremiah the prophet [speaking] from the mouth of theLORD. 

{36:13} And he also rebelled against king Nebuchadnezzar, who hadmade him swear by God: but he stiffened his neck, and hardened hisheart from turning unto the LORD God of Israel.   

{36:14} Moreover all the chief of the priests, and the people,transgressed very much after all the abominations of the heathen; andpolluted the house of the LORD which he had hallowed in Jerusalem.

{36:15} And the LORD God of their fathers sent to them by hismessengers, rising up betimes, and sending; because he had compassionon his people, and on his dwelling place: 

{36:16} But they mocked themessengers of God, and despised his words, and misused his prophets,until the wrath of the LORD arose against his people, till [there was]no remedy. 

{36:17} Therefore he brought upon them the king of theChaldees, who slew their young men with the sword in the house of theirsanctuary, and had no compassion upon young man or maiden, old man, orhim that stooped for age: he gave [them] all into his hand. 

{36:18} Andall the vessels of the house of God, great and small, and the treasuresof the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king, and of hisprinces; all [these] he brought to Babylon. 

{36:19} And they burnt thehouse of God, and brake down the wall of Jerusalem, and burnt all thepalaces thereof with fire, and destroyed all the goodly vesselsthereof. 

{36:20} And them that had escaped from the sword carried heaway to Babylon; where they were servants to him and his sons until thereign of the kingdom of Persia: 

{36:21} To fulfil the word of the LORDby the mouth of Jeremiah, until the land had enjoyed her sabbaths:[for] as long as she lay desolate she kept sabbath, to fulfilthreescore and ten years.   

{36:22} Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the wordof the LORD [spoken] by the mouth of Jeremiah might be accomplished,the LORD stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, that he made aproclamation throughout all his kingdom, and [put it] also in writing,saying, 

{36:23} Thus saith Cyrus king of Persia, All the kingdoms ofthe earth hath the LORD God of heaven given me; and he hath charged meto build him an house in Jerusalem, which [is] in Judah. Who [is there]among you of all his people? The LORD his God [be] with him, and lethim go up.
