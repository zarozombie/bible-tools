{The Book of Ruth   

{1:1} Now it came to pass in the days when the judges ruled, thatthere was a famine in the land. And a certain man of Bethlehemjudahwent to sojourn in the country of Moab, he, and his wife, and his twosons. 

{1:2} And the name of the man [was] Elimelech, and the name ofhis wife Naomi, and the name of his two sons Mahlon and Chilion,Ephrathites of Bethlehemjudah. And they came into the country of Moab,and continued there. 

{1:3} And Elimelech Naomi's husband died; and shewas left, and her two sons. 

{1:4} And they took them wives of the womenof Moab; the name of the one [was] Orpah, and the name of the otherRuth: and they dwelled there about ten years. 

{1:5} And Mahlon andChilion died also both of them; and the woman was left of her two sonsand her husband.   

{1:6} Then she arose with her daughters in law, that she mightreturn from the country of Moab: for she had heard in the country ofMoab how that the LORD had visited his people in giving them bread.

{1:7} Wherefore she went forth out of the place where she was, and hertwo daughters in law with her; and they went on the way to return untothe land of Judah. 

{1:8} And Naomi said unto her two daughters in law,Go, return each to her mother's house: the LORD deal kindly with you,as ye have dealt with the dead, and with me. 

{1:9} The LORD grant youthat ye may find rest, each [of you] in the house of her husband. Thenshe kissed them; and they lifted up their voice, and wept. 

{1:10} Andthey said unto her, Surely we will return with thee unto thy people.

{1:11} And Naomi said, Turn again, my daughters: why will ye go withme? [are] there yet [any more] sons in my womb, that they may be yourhusbands? 

{1:12} Turn again, my daughters, go [your way;] for I am tooold to have an husband. If I should say, I have hope, [if] I shouldhave an husband also to night, and should also bear sons; 

{1:13} Wouldye tarry for them till they were grown? would ye stay for them fromhaving husbands? nay, my daughters; for it grieveth me much for yoursakes that the hand of the LORD is gone out against me. 

{1:14} And theylifted up their voice, and wept again: and Orpah kissed her mother inlaw; but Ruth clave unto her. 

{1:15} And she said, Behold, thy sisterin law is gone back unto her people, and unto her gods: return thouafter thy sister in law. 

{1:16} And Ruth said, Intreat me not to leavethee, [or] to return from following after thee: for whither thou goest,I will go; and where thou lodgest, I will lodge: thy people [shall be]my people, and thy God my God: 

{1:17} Where thou diest, will I die, andthere will I be buried: the LORD do so to me, and more also, [if ought]but death part thee and me. 

{1:18} When she saw that she was stedfastlyminded to go with her, then she left speaking unto her.   

{1:19} So they two went until they came to Bethlehem. And it came topass, when they were come to Bethlehem, that all the city was movedabout them, and they said, [Is] this Naomi? 

{1:20} And she said untothem, Call me not Naomi, call me Mara: for the Almighty hath dealt verybitterly with me. 

{1:21} I went out full, and the LORD hath brought mehome again empty: why [then] call ye me Naomi, seeing the LORD hathtestified against me, and the Almighty hath afflicted me? 

{1:22} SoNaomi returned, and Ruth the Moabitess, her daughter in law, with her,which returned out of the country of Moab: and they came to Bethlehemin the beginning of barley harvest.   

{2:1} And Naomi had a kinsman of her husband's, a mighty man ofwealth, of the family of Elimelech; and his name [was] Boaz. 

{2:2} AndRuth the Moabitess said unto Naomi, Let me now go to the field, andglean ears of corn after [him] in whose sight I shall find grace. Andshe said unto her, Go, my daughter. 

{2:3} And she went, and came, andgleaned in the field after the reapers: and her hap was to light on apart of the field [belonging] unto Boaz, who [was] of the kindred ofElimelech.   

{2:4} And behold, Boaz came from Bethlehem, and said unto thereapers, The LORD [be] with you. And they answered him, The LORD blessthee. 

{2:5} Then said Boaz unto his servant that was set over thereapers, Whose damsel [is] this? 

{2:6} And the servant that was setover the reapers answered and said, It [is] the Moabitish damsel thatcame back with Naomi out of the country of Moab: 

{2:7} And she said, Ipray you, let me glean and gather after the reapers among the sheaves:so she came, and hath continued even from the morning until now, thatshe tarried a little in the house. 

{2:8} Then said Boaz unto Ruth,Hearest thou not, my daughter? Go not to glean in another field,neither go from hence, but abide here fast by my maidens: 

{2:9} [Let]thine eyes [be] on the field that they do reap, and go thou after them:have I not charged the young men that they shall not touch thee? andwhen thou art athirst, go unto the vessels, and drink of [that] whichthe young men have drawn. 

{2:10} Then she fell on her face, and bowedherself to the ground, and said unto him, Why have I found grace inthine eyes, that thou shouldest take knowledge of me, seeing I [am] astranger? 

{2:11} And Boaz answered and said unto her, It hath fullybeen shewed me, all that thou hast done unto thy mother in law sincethe death of thine husband: and [how] thou hast left thy father and thymother, and the land of thy nativity, and art come unto a people whichthou knewest not heretofore. 

{2:12} The LORD recompense thy work, and afull reward be given thee of the LORD God of Israel, under whose wingsthou art come to trust. 

{2:13} Then she said, Let me find favour in thysight, my lord; for that thou hast comforted me, and for that thou hastspoken friendly unto thine handmaid, though I be not like unto one ofthine handmaidens. 

{2:14} And Boaz said unto her, At mealtime come thouhither, and eat of the bread, and dip thy morsel in the vinegar. Andshe sat beside the reapers: and he reached her parched [corn,] and shedid eat, and was sufficed, and left. 

{2:15} And when she was risen upto glean, Boaz commanded his young men, saying, Let her glean evenamong the sheaves, and reproach her not: 

{2:16} And let fall also[some] of the handfuls of purpose for her, and leave [them,] that shemay glean [them,] and rebuke her not. 

{2:17} So she gleaned in thefield until even, and beat out that she had gleaned: and it was aboutan ephah of barley.   

{2:18} And she took [it] up, and went into the city: and her motherin law saw what she had gleaned: and she brought forth, and gave to herthat she had reserved after she was sufficed. 

{2:19} And her mother inlaw said unto her, Where hast thou gleaned to day? and where wroughtestthou? blessed be he that did take knowledge of thee. And she shewed hermother in law with whom she had wrought, and said, The man's name withwhom I wrought to day [is] Boaz. 

{2:20} And Naomi said unto herdaughter in law, Blessed [be] he of the LORD, who hath not left off hiskindness to the living and to the dead. And Naomi said unto her, Theman [is] near of kin unto us, one of our next kinsmen. 

{2:21} And Ruththe Moabitess said, He said unto me also, Thou shalt keep fast by myyoung men, until they have ended all my harvest. 

{2:22} And Naomi saidunto Ruth her daughter in law, [It is] good, my daughter, that thou goout with his maidens, that they meet thee not in any other field.

{2:23} So she kept fast by the maidens of Boaz to glean unto the end ofbarley harvest and of wheat harvest; and dwelt with her mother in law.   

{3:1} Then Naomi her mother in law said unto her, My daughter, shallI not seek rest for thee, that it may be well with thee? 

{3:2} And now[is] not Boaz of our kindred, with whose maidens thou wast? Behold, hewinnoweth barley to night in the threshingfloor. 

{3:3} Wash thyselftherefore, and anoint thee, and put thy raiment upon thee, and get theedown to the floor: [but] make not thyself known unto the man, until heshall have done eating and drinking. 

{3:4} And it shall be, when helieth down, that thou shalt mark the place where he shall lie, and thoushalt go in, and uncover his feet, and lay thee down; and he will tellthee what thou shalt do. 

{3:5} And she said unto her, All that thousayest unto me I will do.   

{3:6} And she went down unto the floor, and did according to allthat her mother in law bade her. 

{3:7} And when Boaz had eaten anddrunk, and his heart was merry, he went to lie down at the end of theheap of corn: and she came softly, and uncovered his feet, and laid herdown.   

{3:8} And it came to pass at midnight, that the man was afraid, andturned himself: and, behold, a woman lay at his feet. 

{3:9} And hesaid, Who [art] thou? And she answered, I [am] Ruth thine handmaid:spread therefore thy skirt over thine handmaid; for thou [art] a nearkinsman. 

{3:10} And he said, Blessed [be] thou of the LORD, mydaughter: [for] thou hast shewed more kindness in the latter end thanat the beginning, inasmuch as thou followedst not young men, whetherpoor or rich. 

{3:11} And now, my daughter, fear not; I will do to theeall that thou requirest: for all the city of my people doth know thatthou [art] a virtuous woman. 

{3:12} And now it is true that I [am thy]near kinsman: howbeit there is a kinsman nearer than I. 

{3:13} Tarrythis night, and it shall be in the morning, [that] if he will performunto thee the part of a kinsman, well; let him do the kinsman's part:but if he will not do the part of a kinsman to thee, then will I do thepart of a kinsman to thee, [as] the LORD liveth: lie down until themorning.   

{3:14} And she lay at his feet until the morning: and she rose upbefore one could know another. And he said, Let it not be known that awoman came into the floor. 

{3:15} Also he said, Bring the vail that[thou hast] upon thee, and hold it. And when she held it, he measuredsix [measures] of barley, and laid [it] on her: and she went into thecity. 

{3:16} And when she came to her mother in law, she said, Who[art] thou, my daughter? And she told her all that the man had done toher. 

{3:17} And she said, These six [measures] of barley gave he me;for he said to me, Go not empty unto thy mother in law. 

{3:18} Thensaid she, Sit still, my daughter, until thou know how the matter willfall: for the man will not be in rest, until he have finished the thingthis day.   

{4:1} Then went Boaz up to the gate, and sat him down there: and,behold, the kinsman of whom Boaz spake came by; unto whom he said, Ho,such a one! turn aside, sit down here. And he turned aside, and satdown. 

{4:2} And he took ten men of the elders of the city, and said,Sit ye down here. And they sat down. 

{4:3} And he said unto thekinsman, Naomi, that is come again out of the country of Moab, selletha parcel of land, which [was] our brother Elimelech's: 

{4:4} And Ithought to advertise thee, saying, Buy [it] before the inhabitants, andbefore the elders of my people. If thou wilt redeem [it,] redeem [it:]but if thou wilt not redeem [it, then] tell me, that I may know: for[there is] none to redeem [it] beside thee; and I [am] after thee. Andhe said, I will redeem [it. ]

{4:5} Then said Boaz, What day thou buyestthe field of the hand of Naomi, thou must buy [it] also of Ruth theMoabitess, the wife of the dead, to raise up the name of the dead uponhis inheritance.   

{4:6} And the kinsman said, I cannot redeem [it] for myself, lest Imar mine own inheritance: redeem thou my right to thyself; for I cannotredeem it. 

{4:7} Now this [was the manner] in former time in Israelconcerning redeeming and concerning changing, for to confirm allthings; a man plucked off his shoe, and gave [it] to his neighbour: andthis [was] a testimony in Israel. 

{4:8} Therefore the kinsman said untoBoaz, Buy [it] for thee. So he drew off his shoe.   

{4:9} And Boaz said unto the elders, and [unto] all the people, Ye[are] witnesses this day, that I have bought all that [was]Elimelech's, and all that [was] Chilion's and Mahlon's, of the hand ofNaomi. 

{4:10} Moreover Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of Mahlon, have Ipurchased to be my wife, to raise up the name of the dead upon hisinheritance, that the name of the dead be not cut off from among hisbrethren, and from the gate of his place: ye [are] witnesses this day.

{4:11} And all the people that [were] in the gate, and the elders,said, [We are] witnesses. The LORD make the woman that is come intothine house like Rachel and like Leah, which two did build the house ofIsrael: and do thou worthily in Ephratah, and be famous in Bethlehem:

{4:12} And let thy house be like the house of Pharez, whom Tamar bareunto Judah, of the seed which the LORD shall give thee of this youngwoman.   

{4:13} So Boaz took Ruth, and she was his wife: and when he went inunto her, the LORD gave her conception, and she bare a son. 

{4:14} Andthe women said unto Naomi, Blessed [be] the LORD, which hath not leftthee this day without a kinsman, that his name may be famous in Israel.

{4:15} And he shall be unto thee a restorer of [thy] life, and anourisher of thine old age: for thy daughter in law, which loveth thee,which is better to thee than seven sons, hath born him. 

{4:16} AndNaomi took the child, and laid it in her bosom, and became nurse untoit. 

{4:17} And the women her neighbours gave it a name, saying, Thereis a son born to Naomi; and they called his name Obed: he [is] thefather of Jesse, the father of David.   

{4:18} Now these [are] the generations of Pharez: Pharez begatHezron, 

{4:19} And Hezron begat Ram, and Ram begat Amminadab, 

{4:20}And Amminadab begat Nahshon, and Nahshon begat Salmon, 

{4:21} AndSalmon begat Boaz, and Boaz begat Obed, 

{4:22} And Obed begat Jesse,and Jesse begat David.
