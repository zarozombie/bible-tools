{The First Book of Moses, called Genesis   

{1:1} In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. 

{1:2}And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness [was] upon theface of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of thewaters.   

{1:3} And God said, Let there be light: and there was light. 

{1:4}And God saw the light, that [it was] good: and God divided the lightfrom the darkness. 

{1:5} And God called the light Day, and the darknesshe called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.   

{1:6} And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of thewaters, and let it divide the waters from the waters. 

{1:7} And Godmade the firmament, and divided the waters which [were] under thefirmament from the waters which [were] above the firmament: and it wasso. 

{1:8} And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and themorning were the second day.   

{1:9} And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gatheredtogether unto one place, and let the dry [land] appear: and it was so.

{1:10} And God called the dry [land] Earth; and the gathering togetherof the waters called he Seas: and God saw that [it was] good. 

{1:11}And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed,[and] the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed [is] initself, upon the earth: and it was so. 

{1:12} And the earth broughtforth grass, [and] herb yielding seed after his kind, and the treeyielding fruit, whose seed [was] in itself, after his kind: and God sawthat [it was] good. 

{1:13} And the evening and the morning were thethird day.   

{1:14} And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of theheaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, andfor seasons, and for days, and years: 

{1:15} And let them be for lightsin the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it wasso. 

{1:16} And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule theday, and the lesser light to rule the night: [he made] the stars also.

{1:17} And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give lightupon the earth, 

{1:18} And to rule over the day and over the night, andto divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that [it was] good.

{1:19} And the evening and the morning were the fourth day. 

{1:20} AndGod said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creaturethat hath life, and fowl [that] may fly above the earth in the openfirmament of heaven. 

{1:21} And God created great whales, and everyliving creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly,after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God sawthat [it was] good. 

{1:22} And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful,and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply inthe earth. 

{1:23} And the evening and the morning were the fifth day.   

{1:24} And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creatureafter his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earthafter his kind: and it was so. 

{1:25} And God made the beast of theearth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing thatcreepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that [it was] good.   

{1:26} And God said, Let us make man in our image, after ourlikeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and overthe fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, andover every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth. 

{1:27} So Godcreated man in his [own] image, in the image of God created he him;male and female created he them. 

{1:28} And God blessed them, and Godsaid unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, andsubdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over thefowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.   

{1:29} And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearingseed, which [is] upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in thewhich [is] the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be formeat. 

{1:30} And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of theair, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein [thereis] life, [I have given] every green herb for meat: and it was so.

{1:31} And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, [it was]very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.   

{2:1} Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the hostof them. 

{2:2} And on the seventh day God ended his work which he hadmade; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he hadmade. 

{2:3} And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: becausethat in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made.   

{2:4} These [are] the generations of the heavens and of the earthwhen they were created, in the day that the LORD God made the earth andthe heavens, 

{2:5} And every plant of the field before it was in theearth, and every herb of the field before it grew: for the LORD God hadnot caused it to rain upon the earth, and [there was] not a man to tillthe ground. 

{2:6} But there went up a mist from the earth, and wateredthe whole face of the ground. 

{2:7} And the LORD God formed man [of]the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath oflife; and man became a living soul.   

{2:8} And the LORD God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and therehe put the man whom he had formed. 

{2:9} And out of the ground made theLORD God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good forfood; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree ofknowledge of good and evil. 

{2:10} And a river went out of Eden towater the garden; and from thence it was parted, and became into fourheads. 

{2:11} The name of the first [is] Pison: that [is] it whichcompasseth the whole land of Havilah, where [there is] gold; 

{2:12} Andthe gold of that land [is] good: there [is] bdellium and the onyxstone. 

{2:13} And the name of the second river [is] Gihon: the same[is] it that compasseth the whole land of Ethiopia. 

{2:14} And the nameof the third river [is] Hiddekel: that [is] it which goeth toward theeast of Assyria. And the fourth river [is] Euphrates. 

{2:15} And theLORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress itand to keep it. 

{2:16} And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, Ofevery tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat: 

{2:17} But of the treeof the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in theday that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.   

{2:18} And the LORD God said, [It is] not good that the man shouldbe alone; I will make him an help meet for him. 

{2:19} And out of theground the LORD God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl ofthe air; and brought [them] unto Adam to see what he would call them:and whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that [was] the namethereof. 

{2:20} And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl ofthe air, and to every beast of the field; but for Adam there was notfound an help meet for him. 

{2:21} And the LORD God caused a deep sleepto fall upon Adam and he slept: and he took one of his ribs, and closedup the flesh instead thereof; 

{2:22} And the rib, which the LORD Godhad taken from man, made he a woman, and brought her unto the man.

{2:23} And Adam said, This [is] now bone of my bones, and flesh of myflesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.

{2:24} Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shallcleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh. 

{2:25} And they wereboth naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed.   

{3:1} Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the fieldwhich the LORD God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath Godsaid, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?   

{3:2} And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruitof the trees of the garden: 

{3:3} But of the fruit of the tree which[is] in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it,neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die. 

{3:4} And the serpent said untothe woman, Ye shall not surely die: 

{3:5} For God doth know that in theday ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be asgods, knowing good and evil. 

{3:6} And when the woman saw that the tree[was] good for food, and that it [was] pleasant to the eyes, and a treeto be desired to make [one] wise, she took of the fruit thereof, anddid eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat. 

{3:7}And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they [were]naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons.

{3:8} And they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden inthe cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from thepresence of the LORD God amongst the trees of the garden. 

{3:9} And theLORD God called unto Adam, and said unto him, Where [art] thou? 

{3:10}And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, becauseI [was] naked; and I hid myself. 

{3:11} And he said, Who told thee thatthou [wast] naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commandedthee that thou shouldest not eat? 

{3:12} And the man said, The womanwhom thou gavest [to be] with me, she gave me of the tree, and I dideat. 

{3:13} And the LORD God said unto the woman, What [is] this [that]thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I dideat. 

{3:14} And the LORD God said unto the serpent, Because thou hastdone this, thou [art] cursed above all cattle, and above every beast ofthe field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat allthe days of thy life: 

{3:15} And I will put enmity between thee and thewoman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, andthou shalt bruise his heel. 

{3:16} Unto the woman he said, I willgreatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shaltbring forth children; and thy desire [shall be] to thy husband, and heshall rule over thee. 

{3:17} And unto Adam he said, Because thou hasthearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, ofwhich I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed [is]the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat [of] it all the daysof thy life; 

{3:18} Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth tothee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field; 

{3:19} In the sweat ofthy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; forout of it wast thou taken: for dust thou [art,] and unto dust shaltthou return. 

{3:20} And Adam called his wife's name Eve; because shewas the mother of all living. 

{3:21} Unto Adam also and to his wife didthe LORD God make coats of skins, and clothed them. 

{3:22} And the LORDGod said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good andevil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree oflife, and eat, and live for ever: 

{3:23} Therefore the LORD God senthim forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence hewas taken. 

{3:24} So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east ofthe garden of Eden Cherubim, and a flaming sword which turned everyway, to keep the way of the tree of life.   

{4:1} And Adam knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bare Cain,and said, I have gotten a man from the LORD. 

{4:2} And she again barehis brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tillerof the ground. 

{4:3} And in process of time it came to pass, that Cainbrought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the LORD. 

{4:4} AndAbel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fatthereof. And the LORD had respect unto Abel and to his offering: 

{4:5}But unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect. And Cain was verywroth, and his countenance fell. 

{4:6} And the LORD said unto Cain, Whyart thou wroth? and why is thy countenance fallen? 

{4:7} If thou doestwell, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou doest not well, sin liethat the door. And unto thee [shall be] his desire, and thou shalt ruleover him. 

{4:8} And Cain talked with Abel his brother: and it came topass, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel hisbrother, and slew him.   

{4:9} And the LORD said unto Cain, Where [is] Abel thy brother? Andhe said, I know not: [Am] I my brother's keeper? 

{4:10} And he said,What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto mefrom the ground. 

{4:11} And now [art] thou cursed from the earth, whichhath opened her mouth to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand;

{4:12} When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield untothee her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in theearth. 

{4:13} And Cain said unto the LORD, My punishment [is] greaterthan I can bear. 

{4:14} Behold, thou hast driven me out this day fromthe face of the earth; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall bea fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to pass,[that] every one that findeth me shall slay me. 

{4:15} And the LORDsaid unto him, Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain, vengeance shall betaken on him sevenfold. And the LORD set a mark upon Cain, lest anyfinding him should kill him.   

{4:16} And Cain went out from the presence of the LORD, and dwelt inthe land of Nod, on the east of Eden. 

{4:17} And Cain knew his wife;and she conceived, and bare Enoch: and he builded a city, and calledthe name of the city, after the name of his son, Enoch. 

{4:18} And untoEnoch was born Irad: and Irad begat Mehujael: and Mehujael begatMethusael: and Methusael begat Lamech.   

{4:19} And Lamech took unto him two wives: the name of the one [was]Adah, and the name of the other Zillah. 

{4:20} And Adah bare Jabal: hewas the father of such as dwell in tents, and [of such as have] cattle.

{4:21} And his brother's name [was] Jubal: he was the father of allsuch as handle the harp and organ. 

{4:22} And Zillah, she also bareTubal- cain, an instructer of every artificer in brass and iron: andthe sister of Tubal-cain [was] Naamah. 

{4:23} And Lamech said unto hiswives, Adah and Zillah, Hear my voice; ye wives of Lamech, hearken untomy speech: for I have slain a man to my wounding, and a young man to myhurt. 

{4:24} If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech seventyand sevenfold.   

{4:25} And Adam knew his wife again; and she bare a son, and calledhis name Seth: For God, [said she,] hath appointed me another seedinstead of Abel, whom Cain slew. 

{4:26} And to Seth, to him also therewas born a son; and he called his name Enos: then began men to callupon the name of the LORD.   

{5:1} This [is] the book of the generations of Adam. In the day thatGod created man, in the likeness of God made he him; 

{5:2} Male andfemale created he them; and blessed them, and called their name Adam,in the day when they were created.   

{5:3} And Adam lived an hundred and thirty years, and begat [a son]in his own likeness, after his image; and called his name Seth: 

{5:4}And the days of Adam after he had begotten Seth were eight hundredyears: and he begat sons and daughters: 

{5:5} And all the days thatAdam lived were nine hundred and thirty years: and he died. 

{5:6} AndSeth lived an hundred and five years, and begat Enos: 

{5:7} And Sethlived after he begat Enos eight hundred and seven years, and begat sonsand daughters: 

{5:8} And all the days of Seth were nine hundred andtwelve years: and he died.   

{5:9} And Enos lived ninety years, and begat Cainan: 

{5:10} And Enoslived after he begat Cainan eight hundred and fifteen years, and begatsons and daughters: 

{5:11} And all the days of Enos were nine hundredand five years: and he died.   

{5:12} And Cainan lived seventy years, and begat Mahalaleel: 

{5:13}And Cainan lived after he begat Mahalaleel eight hundred and fortyyears, and begat sons and daughters: 

{5:14} And all the days of Cainanwere nine hundred and ten years: and he died.   

{5:15} And Mahalaleel lived sixty and five years, and begat Jared:

{5:16} And Mahalaleel lived after he begat Jared eight hundred andthirty years, and begat sons and daughters: 

{5:17} And all the days ofMahalaleel were eight hundred ninety and five years: and he died.   

{5:18} And Jared lived an hundred sixty and two years, and he begatEnoch: 

{5:19} And Jared lived after he begat Enoch eight hundred years,and begat sons and daughters: 

{5:20} And all the days of Jared werenine hundred sixty and two years: and he died.   

{5:21} And Enoch lived sixty and five years, and begat Methuselah:

{5:22} And Enoch walked with God after he begat Methuselah threehundred years, and begat sons and daughters: 

{5:23} And all the days ofEnoch were three hundred sixty and five years: 

{5:24} And Enoch walkedwith God: and he [was] not; for God took him. 

{5:25} And Methuselahlived an hundred eighty and seven years, and begat Lamech: 

{5:26} AndMethuselah lived after he begat Lamech seven hundred eighty and twoyears, and begat sons and daughters: 

{5:27} And all the days ofMethuselah were nine hundred sixty and nine years: and he died.   

{5:28} And Lamech lived an hundred eighty and two years, and begat ason: 

{5:29} And he called his name Noah, saying, This [same] shallcomfort us concerning our work and toil of our hands, because of theground which the LORD hath cursed. 

{5:30} And Lamech lived after hebegat Noah five hundred ninety and five years, and begat sons anddaughters: 

{5:31} And all the days of Lamech were seven hundred seventyand seven years: and he died. 

{5:32} And Noah was five hundred yearsold: and Noah begat Shem, Ham, and Japheth.   

{6:1} And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face ofthe earth, and daughters were born unto them, 

{6:2} That the sons ofGod saw the daughters of men that they [were] fair; and they took themwives of all which they chose. 

{6:3} And the LORD said, My spirit shallnot always strive with man, for that he also [is] flesh: yet his daysshall be an hundred and twenty years. 

{6:4} There were giants in theearth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came inunto the daughters of men, and they bare [children] to them, the same[became] mighty men which [were] of old, men of renown.   

{6:5} And GOD saw that the wickedness of man [was] great in theearth, and [that] every imagination of the thoughts of his heart [was]only evil continually. 

{6:6} And it repented the LORD that he had mademan on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart. 

{6:7} And the LORDsaid, I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of theearth; both man, and beast, and the creeping thing, and the fowls ofthe air; for it repenteth me that I have made them. 

{6:8} But Noahfound grace in the eyes of the LORD.   

{6:9} These [are] the generations of Noah: Noah was a just man [and]perfect in his generations, [and] Noah walked with God. 

{6:10} And Noahbegat three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth. 

{6:11} The earth also wascorrupt before God, and the earth was filled with violence. 

{6:12} AndGod looked upon the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt; for all fleshhad corrupted his way upon the earth. 

{6:13} And God said unto Noah,The end of all flesh is come before me; for the earth is filled withviolence through them; and, behold, I will destroy them with the earth.   

{6:14} Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in theark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch. 

{6:15} And this[is the fashion] which thou shalt make it [of:] The length of the ark[shall be] three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, andthe height of it thirty cubits. 

{6:16} A window shalt thou make to theark, and in a cubit shalt thou finish it above; and the door of the arkshalt thou set in the side thereof; [with] lower, second, and third[stories] shalt thou make it. 

{6:17} And, behold, I, even I, do bring aflood of waters upon the earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein [is] thebreath of life, from under heaven; [and] every thing that [is] in theearth shall die. 

{6:18} But with thee will I establish my covenant; andthou shalt come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thysons' wives with thee. 

{6:19} And of every living thing of all flesh,two of every [sort] shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep [them] alivewith thee; they shall be male and female. 

{6:20} Of fowls after theirkind, and of cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of theearth after his kind, two of every [sort] shall come unto thee, to keep[them] alive. 

{6:21} And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten,and thou shalt gather [it] to thee; and it shall be for food for thee,and for them. 

{6:22} Thus did Noah; according to all that God commandedhim, so did he.   

{7:1} And the LORD said unto Noah, Come thou and all thy house intothe ark; for thee have I seen righteous before me in this generation.

{7:2} Of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee by sevens, the maleand his female: and of beasts that [are] not clean by two, the male andhis female. 

{7:3} Of fowls also of the air by sevens, the male and thefemale; to keep seed alive upon the face of all the earth. 

{7:4} Foryet seven days, and I will cause it to rain upon the earth forty daysand forty nights; and every living substance that I have made will Idestroy from off the face of the earth. 

{7:5} And Noah did accordingunto all that the LORD commanded him. 

{7:6} And Noah [was] six hundredyears old when the flood of waters was upon the earth.   

{7:7} And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons'wives with him, into the ark, because of the waters of the flood. 

{7:8}Of clean beasts, and of beasts that [are] not clean, and of fowls, andof every thing that creepeth upon the earth, 

{7:9} There went in twoand two unto Noah into the ark, the male and the female, as God hadcommanded Noah. 

{7:10} And it came to pass after seven days, that thewaters of the flood were upon the earth.   

{7:11} In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the secondmonth, the seventeenth day of the month, the same day were all thefountains of the great deep broken up, and the windows of heaven wereopened. 

{7:12} And the rain was upon the earth forty days and fortynights. 

{7:13} In the selfsame day entered Noah, and Shem, and Ham, andJapheth, the sons of Noah, and Noah's wife, and the three wives of hissons with them, into the ark; 

{7:14} They, and every beast after hiskind, and all the cattle after their kind, and every creeping thingthat creepeth upon the earth after his kind, and every fowl after hiskind, every bird of every sort. 

{7:15} And they went in unto Noah intothe ark, two and two of all flesh, wherein [is] the breath of life.

{7:16} And they that went in, went in male and female of all flesh, asGod had commanded him: and the LORD shut him in. 

{7:17} And the floodwas forty days upon the earth; and the waters increased, and bare upthe ark, and it was lift up above the earth. 

{7:18} And the watersprevailed, and were increased greatly upon the earth; and the ark wentupon the face of the waters. 

{7:19} And the waters prevailedexceedingly upon the earth; and all the high hills, that [were] underthe whole heaven, were covered. 

{7:20} Fifteen cubits upward did thewaters prevail; and the mountains were covered. 

{7:21} And all fleshdied that moved upon the earth, both of fowl, and of cattle, and ofbeast, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, andevery man: 

{7:22} All in whose nostrils [was] the breath of life, ofall that [was] in the dry [land,] died. 

{7:23} And every livingsubstance was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground, bothman, and cattle, and the creeping things, and the fowl of the heaven;and they were destroyed from the earth: and Noah only remained [alive,]and they that [were] with him in the ark. 

{7:24} And the watersprevailed upon the earth an hundred and fifty days.   

{8:1} And God remembered Noah, and every living thing, and all thecattle that [was] with him in the ark: and God made a wind to pass overthe earth, and the waters asswaged; 

{8:2} The fountains also of thedeep and the windows of heaven were stopped, and the rain from heavenwas restrained; 

{8:3} And the waters returned from off the earthcontinually: and after the end of the hundred and fifty days the waterswere abated. 

{8:4} And the ark rested in the seventh month, on theseventeenth day of the month, upon the mountains of Ararat. 

{8:5} Andthe waters decreased continually until the tenth month: in the tenth[month,] on the first [day] of the month, were the tops of themountains seen.   

{8:6} And it came to pass at the end of forty days, that Noah openedthe window of the ark which he had made: 

{8:7} And he sent forth araven, which went forth to and fro, until the waters were dried up fromoff the earth. 

{8:8} Also he sent forth a dove from him, to see if thewaters were abated from off the face of the ground; 

{8:9} But the dovefound no rest for the sole of her foot, and she returned unto him intothe ark, for the waters [were] on the face of the whole earth: then heput forth his hand, and took her, and pulled her in unto him into theark. 

{8:10} And he stayed yet other seven days; and again he sent forththe dove out of the ark; 

{8:11} And the dove came in to him in theevening; and, lo, in her mouth [was] an olive leaf pluckt off: so Noahknew that the waters were abated from off the earth. 

{8:12} And hestayed yet other seven days; and sent forth the dove; which returnednot again unto him any more.   

{8:13} And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, inthe first [month,] the first [day] of the month, the waters were driedup from off the earth: and Noah removed the covering of the ark, andlooked, and, behold, the face of the ground was dry. 

{8:14} And in thesecond month, on the seven and twentieth day of the month, was theearth dried.   

{8:15} And God spake unto Noah, saying, 

{8:16} Go forth of the ark,thou, and thy wife, and thy sons, and thy sons' wives with thee. 

{8:17}Bring forth with thee every living thing that [is] with thee, of allflesh, [both] of fowl, and of cattle, and of every creeping thing thatcreepeth upon the earth; that they may breed abundantly in the earth,and be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth. 

{8:18} And Noah wentforth, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him: 

{8:19}Every beast, every creeping thing, and every fowl, [and] whatsoevercreepeth upon the earth, after their kinds, went forth out of the ark.   

{8:20} And Noah builded an altar unto the LORD; and took of everyclean beast, and of every clean fowl, and offered burnt offerings onthe altar. 

{8:21} And the LORD smelled a sweet savour; and the LORDsaid in his heart, I will not again curse the ground any more for man'ssake; for the imagination of man's heart [is] evil from his youth;neither will I again smite any more every thing living, as I have done.

{8:22} While the earth remaineth, seedtime and harvest, and cold andheat, and summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease.   

{9:1} And God blessed Noah and his sons, and said unto them, Befruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth. 

{9:2} And the fear ofyou and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, andupon every fowl of the air, upon all that moveth [upon] the earth, andupon all the fishes of the sea; into your hand are they delivered.

{9:3} Every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you; even as thegreen herb have I given you all things. 

{9:4} But flesh with the lifethereof, [which is] the blood thereof, shall ye not eat. 

{9:5} Andsurely your blood of your lives will I require; at the hand of everybeast will I require it, and at the hand of man; at the hand of everyman's brother will I require the life of man. 

{9:6} Whoso sheddethman's blood, by man shall his blood be shed: for in the image of Godmade he man. 

{9:7} And you, be ye fruitful, and multiply; bring forthabundantly in the earth, and multiply therein.   

{9:8} And God spake unto Noah, and to his sons with him, saying,

{9:9} And I, behold, I establish my covenant with you, and with yourseed after you; 

{9:10} And with every living creature that [is] withyou, of the fowl, of the cattle, and of every beast of the earth withyou; from all that go out of the ark, to every beast of the earth.

{9:11} And I will establish my covenant with you; neither shall allflesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither shall thereany more be a flood to destroy the earth. 

{9:12} And God said, This[is] the token of the covenant which I make between me and you andevery living creature that [is] with you, for perpetual generations:

{9:13} I do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a token of acovenant between me and the earth. 

{9:14} And it shall come to pass,when I bring a cloud over the earth, that the bow shall be seen in thecloud: 

{9:15} And I will remember my covenant, which [is] between meand you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall nomore become a flood to destroy all flesh. 

{9:16} And the bow shall bein the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I may remember theeverlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all fleshthat [is] upon the earth. 

{9:17} And God said unto Noah, This [is] thetoken of the covenant, which I have established between me and allflesh that [is] upon the earth.   

{9:18} And the sons of Noah, that went forth of the ark, were Shem,and Ham, and Japheth: and Ham is the father of Canaan. 

{9:19} These[are] the three sons of Noah: and of them was the whole earthoverspread. 

{9:20} And Noah began [to be] an husbandman, and he planteda vineyard: 

{9:21} And he drank of the wine, and was drunken; and hewas uncovered within his tent. 

{9:22} And Ham, the father of Canaan,saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brethren without.

{9:23} And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid [it] upon boththeir shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of theirfather; and their faces [were] backward, and they saw not theirfather's nakedness. 

{9:24} And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew whathis younger son had done unto him. 

{9:25} And he said, Cursed [be]Canaan; a servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren. 

{9:26} Andhe said, Blessed [be] the LORD God of Shem; and Canaan shall be hisservant. 

{9:27} God shall enlarge Japheth, and he shall dwell in thetents of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant.   

{9:28} And Noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years.

{9:29} And all the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years: andhe died.   

{10:1} Now these [are] the generations of the sons of Noah, Shem,Ham, and Japheth: and unto them were sons born after the flood. 

{10:2}The sons of Japheth; Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan, and Tubal,and Meshech, and Tiras. 

{10:3} And the sons of Gomer; Ashkenaz, andRiphath, and Togarmah. 

{10:4} And the sons of Javan; Elishah, andTarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim. 

{10:5} By these were the isles of theGentiles divided in their lands; every one after his tongue, aftertheir families, in their nations.   

{10:6} And the sons of Ham; Cush, and Mizraim, and Phut, and Canaan.

{10:7} And the sons of Cush; Seba, and Havilah, and Sabtah, and Raamah,and Sabtechah: and the sons of Raamah; Sheba, and Dedan. 

{10:8} AndCush begat Nimrod: he began to be a mighty one in the earth. 

{10:9} Hewas a mighty hunter before the LORD: wherefore it is said, Even asNimrod the mighty hunter before the LORD. 

{10:10} And the beginning ofhis kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the land ofShinar. 

{10:11} Out of that land went forth Asshur, and buildedNineveh, and the city Rehoboth, and Calah, 

{10:12} And Resen betweenNineveh and Calah: the same [is] a great city. 

{10:13} And Mizraimbegat Ludim, and Anamim, and Lehabim, and Naphtuhim, 

{10:14} AndPathrusim, and Casluhim, (out of whom came Philistim,) and Caphtorim.   

{10:15} And Canaan begat Sidon his firstborn, and Heth, 

{10:16} Andthe Jebusite, and the Amorite, and the Girgasite, 

{10:17} And theHivite, and the Arkite, and the Sinite, 

{10:18} And the Arvadite, andthe Zemarite, and the Hamathite: and afterward were the families of theCanaanites spread abroad. 

{10:19} And the border of the Canaanites wasfrom Sidon, as thou comest to Gerar, unto Gaza; as thou goest, untoSodom, and Gomorrah, and Admah, and Zeboim, even unto Lasha. 

{10:20}These [are] the sons of Ham, after their families, after their tongues,in their countries, [and] in their nations.   

{10:21} Unto Shem also, the father of all the children of Eber, thebrother of Japheth the elder, even to him were [children] born. 

{10:22}The children of Shem; Elam, and Asshur, and Arphaxad, and Lud, andAram. 

{10:23} And the children of Aram; Uz, and Hul, and Gether, andMash. 

{10:24} And Arphaxad begat Salah; and Salah begat Eber. 

{10:25}And unto Eber were born two sons: the name of one [was] Peleg; for inhis days was the earth divided; and his brother's name [was] Joktan.

{10:26} And Joktan begat Almodad, and Sheleph, and Hazar-maveth, andJerah, 

{10:27} And Hadoram, and Uzal, and Diklah, 

{10:28} And Obal, andAbimael, and Sheba, 

{10:29} And Ophir, and Havilah, and Jobab: allthese [were] the sons of Joktan. 

{10:30} And their dwelling was fromMesha, as thou goest unto Sephar a mount of the east. 

{10:31} These[are] the sons of Shem, after their families, after their tongues, intheir lands, after their nations. 

{10:32} These [are] the families ofthe sons of Noah, after their generations, in their nations: and bythese were the nations divided in the earth after the flood.   

{11:1} And the whole earth was of one language, and of one speech.

{11:2} And it came to pass, as they journeyed from the east, that theyfound a plain in the land of Shinar; and they dwelt there. 

{11:3} Andthey said one to another, Go to, let us make brick, and burn themthroughly. And they had brick for stone, and slime had they for morter.

{11:4} And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whosetop [may reach] unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we bescattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth. 

{11:5} And the LORDcame down to see the city and the tower, which the children of menbuilded. 

{11:6} And the LORD said, Behold, the people [is] one, andthey have all one language; and this they begin to do: and now nothingwill be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do. 

{11:7} Goto, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they maynot understand one another's speech. 

{11:8} So the LORD scattered themabroad from thence upon the face of all the earth: and they left off tobuild the city. 

{11:9} Therefore is the name of it called Babel;because the LORD did there confound the language of all the earth: andfrom thence did the LORD scatter them abroad upon the face of all theearth.   

{11:10} These [are] the generations of Shem: Shem [was] an hundredyears old, and begat Arphaxad two years after the flood: 

{11:11} AndShem lived after he begat Arphaxad five hundred years, and begat sonsand daughters. 

{11:12} And Arphaxad lived five and thirty years, andbegat Salah: 

{11:13} And Arphaxad lived after he begat Salah fourhundred and three years, and begat sons and daughters. 

{11:14} AndSalah lived thirty years, and begat Eber: 

{11:15} And Salah lived afterhe begat Eber four hundred and three years, and begat sons anddaughters. 

{11:16} And Eber lived four and thirty years, and begatPeleg: 

{11:17} And Eber lived after he begat Peleg four hundred andthirty years, and begat sons and daughters. 

{11:18} And Peleg livedthirty years, and begat Reu: 

{11:19} And Peleg lived after he begat Reutwo hundred and nine years, and begat sons and daughters. 

{11:20} AndReu lived two and thirty years, and begat Serug: 

{11:21} And Reu livedafter he begat Serug two hundred and seven years, and begat sons anddaughters. 

{11:22} And Serug lived thirty years, and begat Nahor:

{11:23} And Serug lived after he begat Nahor two hundred years, andbegat sons and daughters. 

{11:24} And Nahor lived nine and twentyyears, and begat Terah: 

{11:25} And Nahor lived after he begat Terah anhundred and nineteen years, and begat sons and daughters. 

{11:26} AndTerah lived seventy years, and begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran.   

{11:27} Now these [are] the generations of Terah: Terah begat Abram,Nahor, and Haran; and Haran begat Lot. 

{11:28} And Haran died beforehis father Terah in the land of his nativity, in Ur of the Chaldees.

{11:29} And Abram and Nahor took them wives: the name of Abram's wife[was] Sarai; and the name of Nahor's wife, Milcah, the daughter ofHaran, the father of Milcah, and the father of Iscah. 

{11:30} But Saraiwas barren; she [had] no child. 

{11:31} And Terah took Abram his son,and Lot the son of Haran his son's son, and Sarai his daughter in law,his son Abram's wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of theChaldees, to go into the land of Canaan; and they came unto Haran, anddwelt there. 

{11:32} And the days of Terah were two hundred and fiveyears: and Terah died in Haran.   

{12:1} Now the LORD had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thycountry, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto a landthat I will shew thee: 

{12:2} And I will make of thee a great nation,and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be ablessing: 

{12:3} And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse himthat curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth beblessed. 

{12:4} So Abram departed, as the LORD had spoken unto him; andLot went with him: and Abram [was] seventy and five years old when hedeparted out of Haran. 

{12:5} And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lothis brother's son, and all their substance that they had gathered, andthe souls that they had gotten in Haran; and they went forth to go intothe land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came.   

{12:6} And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Sichem,unto the plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite [was] then in the land.

{12:7} And the LORD appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will Igive this land: and there builded he an altar unto the LORD, whoappeared unto him. 

{12:8} And he removed from thence unto a mountain onthe east of Bethel, and pitched his tent, [having] Bethel on the west,and Hai on the east: and there he builded an altar unto the LORD, andcalled upon the name of the LORD. 

{12:9} And Abram journeyed, going onstill toward the south.   

{12:10} And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down intoEgypt to sojourn there; for the famine [was] grievous in the land.

{12:11} And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into Egypt,that he said unto Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that thou [art] afair woman to look upon: 

{12:12} Therefore it shall come to pass, whenthe Egyptians shall see thee, that they shall say, This [is] his wife:and they will kill me, but they will save thee alive. 

{12:13} Say, Ipray thee, thou [art] my sister: that it may be well with me for thysake; and my soul shall live because of thee.   

{12:14} And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt,the Egyptians beheld the woman that she [was] very fair. 

{12:15} Theprinces also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before Pharaoh: andthe woman was taken into Pharaoh's house. 

{12:16} And he entreatedAbram well for her sake: and he had sheep, and oxen, and he asses, andmenservants, and maidservants, and she asses, and camels. 

{12:17} Andthe LORD plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because ofSarai Abram's wife. 

{12:18} And Pharaoh called Abram, and said, What[is] this [that] thou hast done unto me? why didst thou not tell methat she [was] thy wife? 

{12:19} Why saidst thou, She [is] my sister?so I might have taken her to me to wife: now therefore behold thy wife,take [her,] and go thy way. 

{12:20} And Pharaoh commanded [his] menconcerning him: and they sent him away, and his wife, and all that hehad.   

{13:1} And Abram went up out of Egypt, he, and his wife, and allthat he had, and Lot with him, into the south. 

{13:2} And Abram [was]very rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold. 

{13:3} And he went on hisjourneys from the south even to Bethel, unto the place where his tenthad been at the beginning, between Bethel and Hai; 

{13:4} Unto theplace of the altar, which he had made there at the first: and thereAbram called on the name of the LORD.   

{13:5} And Lot also, which went with Abram, had flocks, and herds,and tents. 

{13:6} And the land was not able to bear them, that theymight dwell together: for their substance was great, so that they couldnot dwell together. 

{13:7} And there was a strife between the herdmenof Abram's cattle and the herdmen of Lot's cattle: and the Canaaniteand the Perizzite dwelled then in the land. 

{13:8} And Abram said untoLot, Let there be no strife, I pray thee, between me and thee, andbetween my herdmen and thy herdmen; for we [be] brethren. 

{13:9} [Is]not the whole land before thee? separate thyself, I pray thee, from me:if [thou wilt take] the left hand, then I will go to the right; or if[thou depart] to the right hand, then I will go to the left. 

{13:10}And Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the plain of Jordan, that it[was] well watered every where, before the LORD destroyed Sodom andGomorrah, [even] as the garden of the LORD, like the land of Egypt, asthou comest unto Zoar. 

{13:11} Then Lot chose him all the plain ofJordan; and Lot journeyed east: and they separated themselves the onefrom the other. 

{13:12} Abram dwelled in the land of Canaan, and Lotdwelled in the cities of the plain, and pitched [his] tent towardSodom. 

{13:13} But the men of Sodom [were] wicked and sinners beforethe LORD exceedingly.   

{13:14} And the LORD said unto Abram, after that Lot was separatedfrom him, Lift up now thine eyes, and look from the place where thouart northward, and southward, and eastward, and westward: 

{13:15} Forall the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seedfor ever. 

{13:16} And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: sothat if a man can number the dust of the earth, [then] shall thy seedalso be numbered. 

{13:17} Arise, walk through the land in the length ofit and in the breadth of it; for I will give it unto thee. 

{13:18} ThenAbram removed [his] tent, and came and dwelt in the plain of Mamre,which [is] in Hebron, and built there an altar unto the LORD.   

{14:1} And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar,Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king ofnations; 

{14:2} [That these] made war with Bera king of Sodom, and withBirsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king ofZeboiim, and the king of Bela, which is Zoar. 

{14:3} All these werejoined together in the vale of Siddim, which is the salt sea. 

{14:4}Twelve years they served Chedorlaomer, and in the thirteenth year theyrebelled. 

{14:5} And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer, and thekings that [were] with him, and smote the Rephaims in AshterothKarnaim, and the Zuzims in Ham, and the Emims in Shaveh Kiriathaim,

{14:6} And the Horites in their mount Seir, unto El-paran, which [is]by the wilderness. 

{14:7} And they returned, and came to En-mishpat,which [is] Kadesh, and smote all the country of the Amalekites, andalso the Amorites that dwelt in Hazezon- tamar. 

{14:8} And there wentout the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah, and the king of Admah,and the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (the same [is] Zoar;) andthey joined battle with them in the vale of Siddim; 

{14:9} WithChedorlaomer the king of Elam, and with Tidal king of nations, andAmraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar; four kings withfive. 

{14:10} And the vale of Siddim [was full of] slimepits; and thekings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and fell there; and they thatremained fled to the mountain. 

{14:11} And they took all the goods ofSodom and Gomorrah, and all their victuals, and went their way. 

{14:12}And they took Lot, Abram's brother's son, who dwelt in Sodom, and hisgoods, and departed.   

{14:13} And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram theHebrew; for he dwelt in the plain of Mamre the Amorite, brother ofEshcol, and brother of Aner: and these [were] confederate with Abram.

{14:14} And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, hearmed his trained [servants,] born in his own house, three hundred andeighteen, and pursued [them] unto Dan. 

{14:15} And he divided himselfagainst them, he and his servants, by night, and smote them, andpursued them unto Hobah, which [is] on the left hand of Damascus.

{14:16} And he brought back all the goods, and also brought again hisbrother Lot, and his goods, and the women also, and the people.   

{14:17} And the king of Sodom went out to meet him after his returnfrom the slaughter of Chedorlaomer, and of the kings that [were] withhim, at the valley of Shaveh, which [is] the king's dale. 

{14:18} AndMelchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and he [was]the priest of the most high God. 

{14:19} And he blessed him, and said,Blessed [be] Abram of the most high God, possessor of heaven and earth:

{14:20} And blessed be the most high God, which hath delivered thineenemies into thy hand. And he gave him tithes of all. 

{14:21} And theking of Sodom said unto Abram, Give me the persons, and take the goodsto thyself. 

{14:22} And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lift upmine hand unto the LORD, the most high God, the possessor of heaven andearth, 

{14:23} That I will not [take] from a thread even to ashoelatchet, and that I will not take any thing that [is] thine, lestthou shouldest say, I have made Abram rich: 

{14:24} Save only thatwhich the young men have eaten, and the portion of the men which wentwith me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre; let them take their portion.   

{15:1} After these things the word of the LORD came unto Abram in avision, saying, Fear not, Abram: I [am] thy shield, [and] thy exceedinggreat reward. 

{15:2} And Abram said, Lord GOD, what wilt thou give me,seeing I go childless, and the steward of my house is this Eliezer ofDamascus? 

{15:3} And Abram said, Behold, to me thou hast given no seed:and, lo, one born in my house is mine heir. 

{15:4} And, behold, theword of the LORD [came] unto him, saying, This shall not be thine heir;but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thineheir. 

{15:5} And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now towardheaven, and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them: and he saidunto him, So shall thy seed be. 

{15:6} And he believed in the LORD; andhe counted it to him for righteousness. 

{15:7} And he said unto him, I[am] the LORD that brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldees, to give theethis land to inherit it. 

{15:8} And he said, Lord GOD, whereby shall Iknow that I shall inherit it? 

{15:9} And he said unto him, Take me anheifer of three years old, and a she goat of three years old, and a ramof three years old, and a turtledove, and a young pigeon. 

{15:10} Andhe took unto him all these, and divided them in the midst, and laideach piece one against another: but the birds divided he not. 

{15:11}And when the fowls came down upon the carcases, Abram drove them away.

{15:12} And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram;and, lo, an horror of great darkness fell upon him. 

{15:13} And he saidunto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in aland [that is] not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflictthem four hundred years; 

{15:14} And also that nation, whom they shallserve, will I judge: and afterward shall they come out with greatsubstance. 

{15:15} And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thoushalt be buried in a good old age. 

{15:16} But in the fourth generationthey shall come hither again: for the iniquity of the Amorites [is] notyet full. 

{15:17} And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down,and it was dark, behold a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp thatpassed between those pieces. 

{15:18} In the same day the LORD made acovenant with Abram, saying, Unto thy seed have I given this land, fromthe river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Euphrates: 

{15:19}The Kenites, and the Kenizzites, and the Kadmonites, 

{15:20} And theHittites, and the Perizzites, and the Rephaims, 

{15:21} And theAmorites, and the Canaanites, and the Girgashites, and the Jebusites.   

{16:1} Now Sarai Abram's wife bare him no children: and she had anhandmaid, an Egyptian, whose name [was] Hagar. 

{16:2} And Sarai saidunto Abram, Behold now, the LORD hath restrained me from bearing: Ipray thee, go in unto my maid; it may be that I may obtain children byher. And Abram hearkened to the voice of Sarai. 

{16:3} And SaraiAbram's wife took Hagar her maid the Egyptian, after Abram had dweltten years in the land of Canaan, and gave her to her husband Abram tobe his wife.   

{16:4} And he went in unto Hagar, and she conceived: and when shesaw that she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes.

{16:5} And Sarai said unto Abram, My wrong [be] upon thee: I have givenmy maid into thy bosom; and when she saw that she had conceived, I wasdespised in her eyes: the LORD judge between me and thee. 

{16:6} ButAbram said unto Sarai, Behold, thy maid [is] in thy hand; do to her asit pleaseth thee. And when Sarai dealt hardly with her, she fled fromher face.   

{16:7} And the angel of the LORD found her by a fountain of water inthe wilderness, by the fountain in the way to Shur. 

{16:8} And he said,Hagar, Sarai's maid, whence camest thou? and whither wilt thou go? Andshe said, I flee from the face of my mistress Sarai. 

{16:9} And theangel of the LORD said unto her, Return to thy mistress, and submitthyself under her hands. 

{16:10} And the angel of the LORD said untoher, I will multiply thy seed exceedingly, that it shall not benumbered for multitude. 

{16:11} And the angel of the LORD said untoher, Behold, thou [art] with child, and shalt bear a son, and shaltcall his name Ishmael; because the LORD hath heard thy affliction.

{16:12} And he will be a wild man; his hand [will be] against everyman, and every man's hand against him; and he shall dwell in thepresence of all his brethren. 

{16:13} And she called the name of theLORD that spake unto her, Thou God seest me: for she said, Have I alsohere looked after him that seeth me? 

{16:14} Wherefore the well wascalled Beer-lahai-roi; behold, [it is] between Kadesh and Bered.   

{16:15} And Hagar bare Abram a son: and Abram called his son's name,which Hagar bare, Ishmael. 

{16:16} And Abram [was] fourscore and sixyears old, when Hagar bare Ishmael to Abram.   

{17:1} And when Abram was ninety years old and nine, the LORDappeared to Abram, and said unto him, I [am] the Almighty God; walkbefore me, and be thou perfect. 

{17:2} And I will make my covenantbetween me and thee, and will multiply thee exceedingly. 

{17:3} AndAbram fell on his face: and God talked with him, saying, 

{17:4} As forme, behold, my covenant [is] with thee, and thou shalt be a father ofmany nations. 

{17:5} Neither shall thy name any more be called Abram,but thy name shall be Abraham; for a father of many nations have I madethee. 

{17:6} And I will make thee exceeding fruitful, and I will makenations of thee, and kings shall come out of thee. 

{17:7} And I willestablish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee intheir generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a God unto thee,and to thy seed after thee. 

{17:8} And I will give unto thee, and tothy seed after thee, the land wherein thou art a stranger, all the landof Canaan, for an everlasting possession; and I will be their God.   

{17:9} And God said unto Abraham, Thou shalt keep my covenanttherefore, thou, and thy seed after thee in their generations. 

{17:10}This [is] my covenant, which ye shall keep, between me and you and thyseed after thee; Every man child among you shall be circumcised.

{17:11} And ye shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin; and itshall be a token of the covenant betwixt me and you. 

{17:12} And hethat is eight days old shall be circumcised among you, every man childin your generations, he that is born in the house, or bought with moneyof any stranger, which [is] not of thy seed. 

{17:13} He that is born inthy house, and he that is bought with thy money, must needs becircumcised: and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlastingcovenant. 

{17:14} And the uncircumcised man child whose flesh of hisforeskin is not circumcised, that soul shall be cut off from hispeople; he hath broken my covenant.   

{17:15} And God said unto Abraham, As for Sarai thy wife, thou shaltnot call her name Sarai, but Sarah [shall] her name [be. ]

{17:16} And Iwill bless her, and give thee a son also of her: yea, I will bless her,and she shall be [a mother] of nations; kings of people shall be ofher. 

{17:17} Then Abraham fell upon his face, and laughed, and said inhis heart, Shall [a child] be born unto him that is an hundred yearsold? and shall Sarah, that is ninety years old, bear? 

{17:18} AndAbraham said unto God, O that Ishmael might live before thee! 

{17:19}And God said, Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed; and thoushalt call his name Isaac: and I will establish my covenant with himfor an everlasting covenant, [and] with his seed after him. 

{17:20} Andas for Ishmael, I have heard thee: Behold, I have blessed him, and willmake him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly; twelve princesshall he beget, and I will make him a great nation. 

{17:21} But mycovenant will I establish with Isaac, which Sarah shall bear unto theeat this set time in the next year. 

{17:22} And he left off talking withhim, and God went up from Abraham.   

{17:23} And Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all that were born inhis house, and all that were bought with his money, every male amongthe men of Abraham's house; and circumcised the flesh of their foreskinin the selfsame day, as God had said unto him. 

{17:24} And Abraham[was] ninety years old and nine, when he was circumcised in the fleshof his foreskin. 

{17:25} And Ishmael his son [was] thirteen years old,when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin. 

{17:26} In theselfsame day was Abraham circumcised, and Ishmael his son. 

{17:27} Andall the men of his house, born in the house, and bought with money ofthe stranger, were circumcised with him.   

{18:1} And the LORD appeared unto him in the plains of Mamre: and hesat in the tent door in the heat of the day; 

{18:2} And he lift up hiseyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood by him: and when he saw[them,] he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himselftoward the ground, 

{18:3} And said, My Lord, if now I have found favourin thy sight, pass not away, I pray thee, from thy servant: 

{18:4} Leta little water, I pray you, be fetched, and wash your feet, and restyourselves under the tree: 

{18:5} And I will fetch a morsel of bread,and comfort ye your hearts; after that ye shall pass on: for thereforeare ye come to your servant. And they said, So do, as thou hast said.

{18:6} And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah, and said, Makeready quickly three measures of fine meal, knead [it,] and make cakesupon the hearth. 

{18:7} And Abraham ran unto the herd, and fetcht acalf tender and good, and gave [it] unto a young man; and he hasted todress it. 

{18:8} And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which hehad dressed, and set [it] before them; and he stood by them under thetree, and they did eat.   

{18:9} And they said unto him, Where [is] Sarah thy wife? And hesaid, Behold, in the tent. 

{18:10} And he said, I will certainly returnunto thee according to the time of life; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shallhave a son. And Sarah heard [it] in the tent door, which [was] behindhim. 

{18:11} Now Abraham and Sarah [were] old [and] well stricken inage; [and] it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women.

{18:12} Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I amwaxed old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also? 

{18:13} Andthe LORD said unto Abraham, Wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall Iof a surety bear a child, which am old? 

{18:14} Is any thing too hardfor the LORD? At the time appointed I will return unto thee, accordingto the time of life, and Sarah shall have a son. 

{18:15} Then Sarahdenied, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid. And he said, Nay;but thou didst laugh.   

{18:16} And the men rose up from thence, and looked toward Sodom:and Abraham went with them to bring them on the way. 

{18:17} And theLORD said, Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do; 

{18:18}Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, andall the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him? 

{18:19} For Iknow him, that he will command his children and his household afterhim, and they shall keep the way of the LORD, to do justice andjudgment; that the LORD may bring upon Abraham that which he hathspoken of him. 

{18:20} And the LORD said, Because the cry of Sodom andGomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grievous; 

{18:21} Iwill go down now, and see whether they have done altogether accordingto the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not, I will know.

{18:22} And the men turned their faces from thence, and went towardSodom: but Abraham stood yet before the LORD. 

{18:23} And Abraham drewnear, and said, Wilt thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked?

{18:24} Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city: wiltthou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that[are] therein? 

{18:25} That be far from thee to do after this manner,to slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should beas the wicked, that be far from thee: Shall not the Judge of all theearth do right? 

{18:26} And the LORD said, If I find in Sodom fiftyrighteous within the city, then I will spare all the place for theirsakes. 

{18:27} And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have takenupon me to speak unto the Lord, which [am but] dust and ashes: 

{18:28}Peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous: wilt thoudestroy all the city for [lack of] five? And he said, If I find thereforty and five, I will not destroy [it. ]

{18:29} And he spake unto himyet again, and said, Peradventure there shall be forty found there. Andhe said, I will not do [it] for forty's sake. 

{18:30} And he said [untohim,] Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak: Peradventurethere shall thirty be found there. And he said, I will not do [it,] ifI find thirty there. 

{18:31} And he said, Behold now, I have taken uponme to speak unto the Lord: Peradventure there shall be twenty foundthere. And he said, I will not destroy [it] for twenty's sake. 

{18:32}And he said, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak yet butthis once: Peradventure ten shall be found there. And he said, I willnot destroy [it] for ten's sake. 

{18:33} And the LORD went his way, assoon as he had left communing with Abraham: and Abraham returned untohis place.   

{19:1} And there came two angels to Sodom at even; and Lot sat inthe gate of Sodom: and Lot seeing [them] rose up to meet them; and hebowed himself with his face toward the ground; 

{19:2} And he said,Behold now, my lords, turn in, I pray you, into your servant's house,and tarry all night, and wash your feet, and ye shall rise up early,and go on your ways. And they said, Nay; but we will abide in thestreet all night. 

{19:3} And he pressed upon them greatly; and theyturned in unto him, and entered into his house; and he made them afeast, and did bake unleavened bread, and they did eat.   

{19:4} But before they lay down, the men of the city, [even] the menof Sodom, compassed the house round, both old and young, all the peoplefrom every quarter: 

{19:5} And they called unto Lot, and said unto him,Where [are] the men which came in to thee this night? bring them outunto us, that we may know them. 

{19:6} And Lot went out at the doorunto them, and shut the door after him, 

{19:7} And said, I pray you,brethren, do not so wickedly. 

{19:8} Behold now, I have two daughterswhich have not known man; let me, I pray you, bring them out unto you,and do ye to them as [is] good in your eyes: only unto these men donothing; for therefore came they under the shadow of my roof. 

{19:9}And they said, Stand back. And they said [again,] This one [fellow]came in to sojourn, and he will needs be a judge: now will we dealworse with thee, than with them. And they pressed sore upon the man,[even] Lot, and came near to break the door. 

{19:10} But the men putforth their hand, and pulled Lot into the house to them, and shut tothe door. 

{19:11} And they smote the men that [were] at the door of thehouse with blindness, both small and great: so that they weariedthemselves to find the door.   

{19:12} And the men said unto Lot, Hast thou here any besides? sonin law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whatsoever thou hast inthe city, bring [them] out of this place: 

{19:13} For we will destroythis place, because the cry of them is waxen great before the face ofthe LORD; and the LORD hath sent us to destroy it. 

{19:14} And Lot wentout, and spake unto his sons in law, which married his daughters, andsaid, Up, get you out of this place; for the LORD will destroy thiscity. But he seemed as one that mocked unto his sons in law.   

{19:15} And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot,saying, Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters, which are here;lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city. 

{19:16} And while helingered, the men laid hold upon his hand, and upon the hand of hiswife, and upon the hand of his two daughters; the LORD being mercifulunto him: and they brought him forth, and set him without the city.   

{19:17} And it came to pass, when they had brought them forthabroad, that he said, Escape for thy life; look not behind thee,neither stay thou in all the plain; escape to the mountain, lest thoube consumed. 

{19:18} And Lot said unto them, Oh, not so, my Lord:

{19:19} Behold now, thy servant hath found grace in thy sight, and thouhast magnified thy mercy, which thou hast shewed unto me in saving mylife; and I cannot escape to the mountain, lest some evil take me, andI die: 

{19:20} Behold now, this city is near to flee unto, and it is alittle one: Oh, let me escape thither, ([is] it not a little one?) andmy soul shall live. 

{19:21} And he said unto him, See, I have acceptedthee concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow this city,for the which thou hast spoken. 

{19:22} Haste thee, escape thither; forI cannot do any thing till thou be come thither. Therefore the name ofthe city was called Zoar.   

{19:23} The sun was risen upon the earth when Lot entered into Zoar.

{19:24} Then the LORD rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone andfire from the LORD out of heaven; 

{19:25} And he overthrew thosecities, and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, andthat which grew upon the ground.   

{19:26} But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became apillar of salt.   

{19:27} And Abraham gat up early in the morning to the place wherehe stood before the LORD: 

{19:28} And he looked toward Sodom andGomorrah, and toward all the land of the plain, and beheld, and, lo,the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace.   

{19:29} And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of theplain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst ofthe overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in the which Lot dwelt.   

{19:30} And Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, andhis two daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in Zoar: and hedwelt in a cave, he and his two daughters. 

{19:31} And the firstbornsaid unto the younger, Our father [is] old, and [there is] not a man inthe earth to come in unto us after the manner of all the earth: 

{19:32}Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, thatwe may preserve seed of our father. 

{19:33} And they made their fatherdrink wine that night: and the firstborn went in, and lay with herfather; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.

{19:34} And it came to pass on the morrow, that the firstborn said untothe younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my father: let us make himdrink wine this night also; and go thou in, [and] lie with him, that wemay preserve seed of our father. 

{19:35} And they made their fatherdrink wine that night also: and the younger arose, and lay with him;and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose. 

{19:36}Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by their father. 

{19:37}And the firstborn bare a son, and called his name Moab: the same [is]the father of the Moabites unto this day. 

{19:38} And the younger, shealso bare a son, and called his name Benammi: the same [is] the fatherof the children of Ammon unto this day.   

{20:1} And Abraham journeyed from thence toward the south country,and dwelled between Kadesh and Shur, and sojourned in Gerar. 

{20:2} AndAbraham said of Sarah his wife, She [is] my sister: and Abimelech kingof Gerar sent, and took Sarah. 

{20:3} But God came to Abimelech in adream by night, and said to him, Behold, thou [art but] a dead man, forthe woman which thou hast taken; for she [is] a man's wife. 

{20:4} ButAbimelech had not come near her: and he said, Lord, wilt thou slay alsoa righteous nation? 

{20:5} Said he not unto me, She [is] my sister? andshe, even she herself said, He [is] my brother: in the integrity of myheart and innocency of my hands have I done this. 

{20:6} And God saidunto him in a dream, Yea, I know that thou didst this in the integrityof thy heart; for I also withheld thee from sinning against me:therefore suffered I thee not to touch her. 

{20:7} Now thereforerestore the man [his] wife; for he [is] a prophet, and he shall prayfor thee, and thou shalt live: and if thou restore [her] not, know thouthat thou shalt surely die, thou, and all that [are] thine. 

{20:8}Therefore Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all hisservants, and told all these things in their ears: and the men weresore afraid. 

{20:9} Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said unto him,What hast thou done unto us? and what have I offended thee, that thouhast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? thou hast done deedsunto me that ought not to be done. 

{20:10} And Abimelech said untoAbraham, What sawest thou, that thou hast done this thing? 

{20:11} AndAbraham said, Because I thought, Surely the fear of God [is] not inthis place; and they will slay me for my wife's sake. 

{20:12} And yetindeed [she is] my sister; she [is] the daughter of my father, but notthe daughter of my mother; and she became my wife. 

{20:13} And it cameto pass, when God caused me to wander from my father's house, that Isaid unto her, This [is] thy kindness which thou shalt shew unto me; atevery place whither we shall come, say of me, He [is] my brother.

{20:14} And Abimelech took sheep, and oxen, and menservants, andwomenservants, and gave [them] unto Abraham, and restored him Sarah hiswife. 

{20:15} And Abimelech said, Behold, my land [is] before thee:dwell where it pleaseth thee. 

{20:16} And unto Sarah he said, Behold, Ihave given thy brother a thousand [pieces] of silver: behold, he [is]to thee a covering of the eyes, unto all that [are] with thee, and withall [other:] thus she was reproved.   

{20:17} So Abraham prayed unto God: and God healed Abimelech, andhis wife, and his maidservants; and they bare [children. ]

{20:18} Forthe LORD had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of Abimelech,because of Sarah Abraham's wife.   

{21:1} And the LORD visited Sarah as he had said, and the LORD didunto Sarah as he had spoken. 

{21:2} For Sarah conceived, and bareAbraham a son in his old age, at the set time of which God had spokento him. 

{21:3} And Abraham called the name of his son that was bornunto him, whom Sarah bare to him, Isaac. 

{21:4} And Abraham circumcisedhis son Isaac being eight days old, as God had commanded him. 

{21:5}And Abraham was an hundred years old, when his son Isaac was born untohim.   

{21:6} And Sarah said, God hath made me to laugh, [so that] all thathear will laugh with me. 

{21:7} And she said, Who would have said untoAbraham, that Sarah should have given children suck? for I have born[him] a son in his old age. 

{21:8} And the child grew, and was weaned:and Abraham made a great feast the [same] day that Isaac was weaned.   

{21:9} And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, which she hadborn unto Abraham, mocking. 

{21:10} Wherefore she said unto Abraham,Cast out this bondwoman and her son: for the son of this bondwomanshall not be heir with my son, [even] with Isaac. 

{21:11} And the thingwas very grievous in Abraham's sight because of his son.   

{21:12} And God said unto Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thysight because of the lad, and because of thy bondwoman; in all thatSarah hath said unto thee, hearken unto her voice; for in Isaac shallthy seed be called. 

{21:13} And also of the son of the bondwoman will Imake a nation, because he [is] thy seed. 

{21:14} And Abraham rose upearly in the morning, and took bread, and a bottle of water, and gave[it] unto Hagar, putting [it] on her shoulder, and the child, and senther away: and she departed, and wandered in the wilderness ofBeer-sheba. 

{21:15} And the water was spent in the bottle, and she castthe child under one of the shrubs. 

{21:16} And she went, and sat herdown over against [him] a good way off, as it were a bowshot: for shesaid, Let me not see the death of the child. And she sat over against[him,] and lift up her voice, and wept. 

{21:17} And God heard the voiceof the lad; and the angel of God called Hagar out of heaven, and saidunto her, What aileth thee, Hagar? fear not; for God hath heard thevoice of the lad where he [is. ]

{21:18} Arise, lift up the lad, andhold him in thine hand; for I will make him a great nation. 

{21:19} AndGod opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went, andfilled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink. 

{21:20} And Godwas with the lad; and he grew, and dwelt in the wilderness, and becamean archer. 

{21:21} And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran: and hismother took him a wife out of the land of Egypt.   

{21:22} And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech and Phicholthe chief captain of his host spake unto Abraham, saying, God [is] withthee in all that thou doest: 

{21:23} Now therefore swear unto me hereby God that thou wilt not deal falsely with me, nor with my son, norwith my son's son: [but] according to the kindness that I have doneunto thee, thou shalt do unto me, and to the land wherein thou hastsojourned. 

{21:24} And Abraham said, I will swear. 

{21:25} And Abrahamreproved Abimelech because of a well of water, which Abimelech'sservants had violently taken away. 

{21:26} And Abimelech said, I wotnot who hath done this thing: neither didst thou tell me, neither yetheard I [of it,] but to day. 

{21:27} And Abraham took sheep and oxen,and gave them unto Abimelech; and both of them made a covenant. 

{21:28}And Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves. 

{21:29} AndAbimelech said unto Abraham, What [mean] these seven ewe lambs whichthou hast set by themselves? 

{21:30} And he said, For [these] seven ewelambs shalt thou take of my hand, that they may be a witness unto me,that I have digged this well. 

{21:31} Wherefore he called that placeBeer-sheba; because there they sware both of them. 

{21:32} Thus theymade a covenant at Beer-sheba: then Abimelech rose up, and Phichol thechief captain of his host, and they returned into the land of thePhilistines.   

{21:33} And [Abraham] planted a grove in Beer-sheba, and calledthere on the name of the LORD, the everlasting God. 

{21:34} And Abrahamsojourned in the Philistines' land many days.   

{22:1} And it came to pass after these things, that God did temptAbraham, and said unto him, Abraham: and he said, Behold, [here] I [am.]

{22:2} And he said, Take now thy son, thine only [son] Isaac, whomthou lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him therefor a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell theeof.   

{22:3} And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and saddled hisass, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, andclave the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went unto theplace of which God had told him. 

{22:4} Then on the third day Abrahamlifted up his eyes, and saw the place afar off. 

{22:5} And Abraham saidunto his young men, Abide ye here with the ass; and I and the lad willgo yonder and worship, and come again to you, 

{22:6} And Abraham tookthe wood of the burnt offering, and laid [it] upon Isaac his son; andhe took the fire in his hand, and a knife; and they went both of themtogether. 

{22:7} And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father, and said, Myfather: and he said, Here [am] I, my son. And he said, Behold the fireand the wood: but where [is] the lamb for a burnt offering? 

{22:8} AndAbraham said, My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burntoffering: so they went both of them together. 

{22:9} And they came tothe place which God had told him of; and Abraham built an altar there,and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his son, and laid him onthe altar upon the wood. 

{22:10} And Abraham stretched forth his hand,and took the knife to slay his son. 

{22:11} And the angel of the LORDcalled unto him out of heaven, and said, Abraham, Abraham: and he said,Here [am] I. 

{22:12} And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad,neither do thou any thing unto him: for now I know that thou fearestGod, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only [son] from me.

{22:13} And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold behind[him] a ram caught in a thicket by his horns: and Abraham went and tookthe ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of hisson. 

{22:14} And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah-jireh:as it is said [to] this day, In the mount of the LORD it shall be seen.   

{22:15} And the angel of the LORD called unto Abraham out of heaventhe second time, 

{22:16} And said, By myself have I sworn, saith theLORD, for because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thyson, thine only [son: ]

{22:17} That in blessing I will bless thee, andin multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, andas the sand which [is] upon the sea shore; and thy seed shall possessthe gate of his enemies; 

{22:18} And in thy seed shall all the nationsof the earth be blessed; because thou hast obeyed my voice. 

{22:19} SoAbraham returned unto his young men, and they rose up and went togetherto Beer-sheba; and Abraham dwelt at Beer-sheba.   

{22:20} And it came to pass after these things, that it was toldAbraham, saying, Behold, Milcah, she hath also born children unto thybrother Nahor; 

{22:21} Huz his firstborn, and Buz his brother, andKemuel the father of Aram, 

{22:22} And Chesed, and Hazo, and Pildash,and Jidlaph, and Bethuel. 

{22:23} And Bethuel begat Rebekah: theseeight Milcah did bear to Nahor, Abraham's brother. 

{22:24} And hisconcubine, whose name [was] Reumah, she bare also Tebah, and Gaham, andThahash, and Maachah.   

{23:1} And Sarah was an hundred and seven and twenty years old:[these were] the years of the life of Sarah. 

{23:2} And Sarah died inKirjath-arba; the same [is] Hebron in the land of Canaan: and Abrahamcame to mourn for Sarah, and to weep for her.   

{23:3} And Abraham stood up from before his dead, and spake unto thesons of Heth, saying, 

{23:4} I [am] a stranger and a sojourner withyou: give me a possession of a buryingplace with you, that I may burymy dead out of my sight. 

{23:5} And the children of Heth answeredAbraham, saying unto him, 

{23:6} Hear us, my lord: thou [art] a mightyprince among us: in the choice of our sepulchres bury thy dead; none ofus shall withhold from thee his sepulchre, but that thou mayest burythy dead. 

{23:7} And Abraham stood up, and bowed himself to the peopleof the land, [even] to the children of Heth. 

{23:8} And he communedwith them, saying, If it be your mind that I should bury my dead out ofmy sight; hear me, and intreat for me to Ephron the son of Zohar,

{23:9} That he may give me the cave of Machpelah, which he hath, which[is] in the end of his field; for as much money as it is worth he shallgive it me for a possession of a buryingplace amongst you. 

{23:10} AndEphron dwelt among the children of Heth: and Ephron the Hittiteanswered Abraham in the audience of the children of Heth, [even] of allthat went in at the gate of his city, saying, 

{23:11} Nay, my lord,hear me: the field give I thee, and the cave that [is] therein, I giveit thee; in the presence of the sons of my people give I it thee: burythy dead. 

{23:12} And Abraham bowed down himself before the people ofthe land. 

{23:13} And he spake unto Ephron in the audience of thepeople of the land, saying, But if thou [wilt give it,] I pray thee,hear me: I will give thee money for the field; take [it] of me, and Iwill bury my dead there. 

{23:14} And Ephron answered Abraham, sayingunto him, 

{23:15} My lord, hearken unto me: the land [is worth] fourhundred shekels of silver; what [is] that betwixt me and thee? burytherefore thy dead. 

{23:16} And Abraham hearkened unto Ephron; andAbraham weighed to Ephron the silver, which he had named in theaudience of the sons of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, current[money] with the merchant.   

{23:17} And the field of Ephron, which [was] in Machpelah, which[was] before Mamre, the field, and the cave which [was] therein, andall the trees that [were] in the field, that [were] in all the bordersround about, were made sure 

{23:18} Unto Abraham for a possession inthe presence of the children of Heth, before all that went in at thegate of his city. 

{23:19} And after this, Abraham buried Sarah his wifein the cave of the field of Machpelah before Mamre: the same [is]Hebron in the land of Canaan. 

{23:20} And the field, and the cave that[is] therein, were made sure unto Abraham for a possession of aburyingplace by the sons of Heth.   

{24:1} And Abraham was old, [and] well stricken in age: and the LORDhad blessed Abraham in all things. 

{24:2} And Abraham said unto hiseldest servant of his house, that ruled over all that he had, Put, Ipray thee, thy hand under my thigh: 

{24:3} And I will make thee swearby the LORD, the God of heaven, and the God of the earth, that thoushalt not take a wife unto my son of the daughters of the Canaanites,among whom I dwell: 

{24:4} But thou shalt go unto my country, and to mykindred, and take a wife unto my son Isaac. 

{24:5} And the servant saidunto him, Peradventure the woman will not be willing to follow me untothis land: must I needs bring thy son again unto the land from whencethou camest? 

{24:6} And Abraham said unto him, Beware thou that thoubring not my son thither again.   

{24:7} The LORD God of heaven, which took me from my father's house,and from the land of my kindred, and which spake unto me, and thatsware unto me, saying, Unto thy seed will I give this land; he shallsend his angel before thee, and thou shalt take a wife unto my son fromthence. 

{24:8} And if the woman will not be willing to follow thee,then thou shalt be clear from this my oath: only bring not my sonthither again. 

{24:9} And the servant put his hand under the thigh ofAbraham his master, and sware to him concerning that matter.   

{24:10} And the servant took ten camels of the camels of his master,and departed; for all the goods of his master [were] in his hand: andhe arose, and went to Mesopotamia, unto the city of Nahor. 

{24:11} Andhe made his camels to kneel down without the city by a well of water atthe time of the evening, [even] the time that women go out to draw[water. ]

{24:12} And he said, O LORD God of my master Abraham, I praythee, send me good speed this day, and shew kindness unto my masterAbraham. 

{24:13} Behold, I stand [here] by the well of water; and thedaughters of the men of the city come out to draw water: 

{24:14} Andlet it come to pass, that the damsel to whom I shall say, Let down thypitcher, I pray thee, that I may drink; and she shall say, Drink, and Iwill give thy camels drink also: [let the same be] she [that] thou hastappointed for thy servant Isaac; and thereby shall I know that thouhast shewed kindness unto my master.   

{24:15} And it came to pass, before he had done speaking, that,behold, Rebekah came out, who was born to Bethuel, son of Milcah, thewife of Nahor, Abraham's brother, with her pitcher upon her shoulder.

{24:16} And the damsel [was] very fair to look upon, a virgin, neitherhad any man known her: and she went down to the well, and filled herpitcher, and came up. 

{24:17} And the servant ran to meet her, andsaid, Let me, I pray thee, drink a little water of thy pitcher. 

{24:18}And she said, Drink, my lord: and she hasted, and let down her pitcherupon her hand, and gave him drink. 

{24:19} And when she had done givinghim drink, she said, I will draw [water] for thy camels also, untilthey have done drinking. 

{24:20} And she hasted, and emptied herpitcher into the trough, and ran again unto the well to draw [water,]and drew for all his camels. 

{24:21} And the man wondering at her heldhis peace, to wit whether the LORD had made his journey prosperous ornot. 

{24:22} And it came to pass, as the camels had done drinking, thatthe man took a golden earring of half a shekel weight, and twobracelets for her hands of ten [shekels] weight of gold; 

{24:23} Andsaid, Whose daughter [art] thou? tell me, I pray thee: is there room[in] thy father's house for us to lodge in? 

{24:24} And she said untohim, I [am] the daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah, which she bareunto Nahor. 

{24:25} She said moreover unto him, We have both straw andprovender enough, and room to lodge in. 

{24:26} And the man bowed downhis head, and worshipped the LORD. 

{24:27} And he said, Blessed [be]the LORD God of my master Abraham, who hath not left destitute mymaster of his mercy and his truth: I [being] in the way, the LORD ledme to the house of my master's brethren. 

{24:28} And the damsel ran,and told [them of] her mother's house these things.   

{24:29} And Rebekah had a brother, and his name [was] Laban: andLaban ran out unto the man, unto the well. 

{24:30} And it came to pass,when he saw the earring and bracelets upon his sister's hands, and whenhe heard the words of Rebekah his sister, saying, Thus spake the manunto me; that he came unto the man; and, behold, he stood by the camelsat the well. 

{24:31} And he said, Come in, thou blessed of the LORD;wherefore standest thou without? for I have prepared the house, androom for the camels.   

{24:32} And the man came into the house: and he ungirded his camels,and gave straw and provender for the camels, and water to wash hisfeet, and the men's feet that [were] with him. 

{24:33} And there wasset [meat] before him to eat: but he said, I will not eat, until I havetold mine errand. And he said, Speak on. 

{24:34} And he said, I [am]Abraham's servant. 

{24:35} And the LORD hath blessed my master greatly;and he is become great: and he hath given him flocks, and herds, andsilver, and gold, and menservants, and maidservants, and camels, andasses. 

{24:36} And Sarah my master's wife bare a son to my master whenshe was old: and unto him hath he given all that he hath. 

{24:37} Andmy master made me swear, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife to my sonof the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I dwell: 

{24:38} Butthou shalt go unto my father's house, and to my kindred, and take awife unto my son. 

{24:39} And I said unto my master, Peradventure thewoman will not follow me. 

{24:40} And he said unto me, The LORD, beforewhom I walk, will send his angel with thee, and prosper thy way; andthou shalt take a wife for my son of my kindred, and of my father'shouse: 

{24:41} Then shalt thou be clear from [this] my oath, when thoucomest to my kindred; and if they give not thee [one,] thou shalt beclear from my oath. 

{24:42} And I came this day unto the well, andsaid, O LORD God of my master Abraham, if now thou do prosper my waywhich I go; 

{24:43} Behold, I stand by the well of water; and it shallcome to pass, that when the virgin cometh forth to draw [water,] and Isay to her, Give me, I pray thee, a little water of thy pitcher todrink; 

{24:44} And she say to me, Both drink thou, and I will also drawfor thy camels: [let] the same [be] the woman whom the LORD hathappointed out for my master's son. 

{24:45} And before I had donespeaking in mine heart, behold, Rebekah came forth with her pitcher onher shoulder; and she went down unto the well, and drew [water:] and Isaid unto her, Let me drink, I pray thee. 

{24:46} And she made haste,and let down her pitcher from her [shoulder,] and said, Drink, and Iwill give thy camels drink also: so I drank, and she made the camelsdrink also. 

{24:47} And I asked her, and said, Whose daughter [art]thou? And she said, The daughter of Bethuel, Nahor's son, whom Milcahbare unto him: and I put the earring upon her face, and the braceletsupon her hands. 

{24:48} And I bowed down my head, and worshipped theLORD, and blessed the LORD God of my master Abraham, which had led mein the right way to take my master's brother's daughter unto his son.

{24:49} And now if ye will deal kindly and truly with my master, tellme: and if not, tell me; that I may turn to the right hand, or to theleft. 

{24:50} Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said, The thingproceedeth from the LORD: we cannot speak unto thee bad or good.

{24:51} Behold, Rebekah [is] before thee, take [her,] and go, and lether be thy master's son's wife, as the LORD hath spoken. 

{24:52} And itcame to pass, that, when Abraham's servant heard their words, heworshipped the LORD, [bowing himself] to the earth. 

{24:53} And theservant brought forth jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, andraiment, and gave [them] to Rebekah: he gave also to her brother and toher mother precious things. 

{24:54} And they did eat and drink, he andthe men that [were] with him, and tarried all night; and they rose upin the morning, and he said, Send me away unto my master. 

{24:55} Andher brother and her mother said, Let the damsel abide with us [a few]days, at the least ten; after that she shall go. 

{24:56} And he saidunto them, Hinder me not, seeing the LORD hath prospered my way; sendme away that I may go to my master. 

{24:57} And they said, We will callthe damsel, and enquire at her mouth. 

{24:58} And they called Rebekah,and said unto her, Wilt thou go with this man? And she said, I will go.

{24:59} And they sent away Rebekah their sister, and her nurse, andAbraham's servant, and his men. 

{24:60} And they blessed Rebekah, andsaid unto her, Thou [art] our sister, be thou [the mother] of thousandsof millions, and let thy seed possess the gate of those which hate them.   

{24:61} And Rebekah arose, and her damsels, and they rode upon thecamels, and followed the man: and the servant took Rebekah, and wenthis way. 

{24:62} And Isaac came from the way of the well Lahai-roi; forhe dwelt in the south country. 

{24:63} And Isaac went out to meditatein the field at the eventide: and he lifted up his eyes, and saw, and,behold, the camels [were] coming. 

{24:64} And Rebekah lifted up hereyes, and when she saw Isaac, she lighted off the camel. 

{24:65} Forshe [had] said unto the servant, What man [is] this that walketh in thefield to meet us? And the servant [had] said, It [is] my master:therefore she took a vail, and covered herself. 

{24:66} And the servanttold Isaac all things that he had done. 

{24:67} And Isaac brought herinto his mother Sarah's tent, and took Rebekah, and she became hiswife; and he loved her: and Isaac was comforted after his mother's[death.]   

{25:1} Then again Abraham took a wife, and her name [was] Keturah.

{25:2} And she bare him Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian, andIshbak, and Shuah. 

{25:3} And Jokshan begat Sheba, and Dedan. And thesons of Dedan were Asshurim, and Letushim, and Leummim. 

{25:4} And thesons of Midian; Ephah, and Epher, and Hanoch, and Abidah, and Eldaah.All these [were] the children of Keturah.   

{25:5} And Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac. 

{25:6} But untothe sons of the concubines, which Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts, andsent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, eastward, untothe east country. 

{25:7} And these [are] the days of the years ofAbraham's life which he lived, an hundred threescore and fifteen years.

{25:8} Then Abraham gave up the ghost, and died in a good old age, anold man, and full [of years;] and was gathered to his people. 

{25:9}And his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah, inthe field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, which [is] beforeMamre; 

{25:10} The field which Abraham purchased of the sons of Heth:there was Abraham buried, and Sarah his wife.   

{25:11} And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that Godblessed his son Isaac; and Isaac dwelt by the well Lahai-roi.   

{25:12} Now these [are] the generations of Ishmael, Abraham's son,whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah's handmaid, bare unto Abraham: 

{25:13}And these [are] the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names,according to their generations: the firstborn of Ishmael, Nebajoth; andKedar, and Adbeel, and Mibsam, 

{25:14} And Mishma, and Dumah, andMassa, 

{25:15} Hadar, and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah: 

{25:16}These [are] the sons of Ishmael, and these [are] their names, by theirtowns, and by their castles; twelve princes according to their nations.

{25:17} And these [are] the years of the life of Ishmael, an hundredand thirty and seven years: and he gave up the ghost and died; and wasgathered unto his people. 

{25:18} And they dwelt from Havilah untoShur, that [is] before Egypt, as thou goest toward Assyria: [and] hedied in the presence of all his brethren.   

{25:19} And these [are] the generations of Isaac, Abraham's son:Abraham begat Isaac: 

{25:20} And Isaac was forty years old when he tookRebekah to wife, the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Padan-aram, thesister to Laban the Syrian. 

{25:21} And Isaac intreated the LORD forhis wife, because she [was] barren: and the LORD was intreated of him,and Rebekah his wife conceived. 

{25:22} And the children struggledtogether within her; and she said, If [it be] so, why [am] I thus? Andshe went to enquire of the LORD. 

{25:23} And the LORD said unto her,Two nations [are] in thy womb, and two manner of people shall beseparated from thy bowels; and [the one] people shall be stronger than[the other] people; and the elder shall serve the younger.   

{25:24} And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold,[there were] twins in her womb. 

{25:25} And the first came out red, allover like an hairy garment; and they called his name Esau. 

{25:26} Andafter that came his brother out, and his hand took hold on Esau's heel;and his name was called Jacob: and Isaac [was] threescore years oldwhen she bare them. 

{25:27} And the boys grew: and Esau was a cunninghunter, a man of the field; and Jacob [was] a plain man, dwelling intents. 

{25:28} And Isaac loved Esau, because he did eat of [his]venison: but Rebekah loved Jacob.   

{25:29} And Jacob sod pottage: and Esau came from the field, and he[was] faint: 

{25:30} And Esau said to Jacob, Feed me, I pray thee, withthat same red [pottage;] for I [am] faint: therefore was his namecalled Edom. 

{25:31} And Jacob said, Sell me this day thy birthright.

{25:32} And Esau said, Behold, I [am] at the point to die: and whatprofit shall this birthright do to me? 

{25:33} And Jacob said, Swear tome this day; and he sware unto him: and he sold his birthright untoJacob. 

{25:34} Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentiles; andhe did eat and drink, and rose up, and went his way: thus Esau despised[his] birthright.   

{26:1} And there was a famine in the land, beside the first faminethat was in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went unto Abimelech king ofthe Philistines unto Gerar. 

{26:2} And the LORD appeared unto him, andsaid, Go not down into Egypt; dwell in the land which I shall tell theeof: 

{26:3} Sojourn in this land, and I will be with thee, and willbless thee; for unto thee, and unto thy seed, I will give all thesecountries, and I will perform the oath which I sware unto Abraham thyfather; 

{26:4} And I will make thy seed to multiply as the stars ofheaven, and will give unto thy seed all these countries; and in thyseed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; 

{26:5} Because thatAbraham obeyed my voice, and kept my charge, my commandments, mystatutes, and my laws.   

{26:6} And Isaac dwelt in Gerar: 

{26:7} And the men of the placeasked [him] of his wife; and he said, She [is] my sister: for he fearedto say, [She is] my wife; lest, [said he,] the men of the place shouldkill me for Rebekah; because she [was] fair to look upon. 

{26:8} And itcame to pass, when he had been there a long time, that Abimelech kingof the Philistines looked out at a window, and saw, and, behold, Isaac[was] sporting with Rebekah his wife. 

{26:9} And Abimelech calledIsaac, and said, Behold, of a surety she [is] thy wife: and how saidstthou, She [is] my sister? And Isaac said unto him, Because I said, LestI die for her. 

{26:10} And Abimelech said, What [is] this thou hastdone unto us? one of the people might lightly have lien with thy wife,and thou shouldest have brought guiltiness upon us. 

{26:11} AndAbimelech charged all [his] people, saying, He that toucheth this manor his wife shall surely be put to death. 

{26:12} Then Isaac sowed inthat land, and received in the same year an hundredfold: and the LORDblessed him. 

{26:13} And the man waxed great, and went forward, andgrew until he became very great: 

{26:14} For he had possession offlocks, and possession of herds, and great store of servants: and thePhilistines envied him. 

{26:15} For all the wells which his father'sservants had digged in the days of Abraham his father, the Philistineshad stopped them, and filled them with earth. 

{26:16} And Abimelechsaid unto Isaac, Go from us; for thou art much mightier than we.   

{26:17} And Isaac departed thence, and pitched his tent in thevalley of Gerar, and dwelt there. 

{26:18} And Isaac digged again thewells of water, which they had digged in the days of Abraham hisfather; for the philistines had stopped them after the death ofAbraham: and he called their names after the names by which his fatherhad called them. 

{26:19} And Isaac's servants digged in the valley, andfound there a well of springing water. 

{26:20} And the herdmen of Gerardid strive with Isaac's herdmen, saying, The water [is] ours: and hecalled the name of the well Esek; because they strove with him. 

{26:21}And they digged another well, and strove for that also: and he calledthe name of it Sitnah. 

{26:22} And he removed from thence, and diggedanother well; and for that they strove not: and he called the name ofit Rehoboth; and he said, For now the LORD hath made room for us, andwe shall be fruitful in the land. 

{26:23} And he went up from thence toBeer-sheba. 

{26:24} And the LORD appeared unto him the same night, andsaid, I [am] the God of Abraham thy father: fear not, for I [am] withthee, and will bless thee, and multiply thy seed for my servantAbraham's sake. 

{26:25} And he builded an altar there, and called uponthe name of the LORD and pitched his tent there: and there Isaac'sservants digged a well.   

{26:26} Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath one ofhis friends, and Phichol the chief captain of his army. 

{26:27} AndIsaac said unto them, Wherefore come ye to me, seeing ye hate me, andhave sent me away from you? 

{26:28} And they said, We saw certainlythat the LORD was with thee: and we said, Let there be now an oathbetwixt us, [even] betwixt us and thee, and let us make a covenant withthee; 

{26:29} That thou wilt do us no hurt, as we have not touchedthee, and as we have done unto thee nothing but good, and have sentthee away in peace: thou [art] now the blessed of the LORD. 

{26:30} Andhe made them a feast, and they did eat and drink. 

{26:31} And they roseup betimes in the morning, and sware one to another: and Isaac sentthem away, and they departed from him in peace. 

{26:32} And it came topass the same day, that Isaac's servants came, and told him concerningthe well which they had digged, and said unto him, We have found water.

{26:33} And he called it Shebah: therefore the name of the city [is]Beer-sheba unto this day.   

{26:34} And Esau was forty years old when he took to wife Judith thedaughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Bashemath the daughter of Elon theHittite: 

{26:35} Which were a grief of mind unto Isaac and to Rebekah.   

{27:1} And it came to pass, that when Isaac was old, and his eyeswere dim, so that he could not see, he called Esau his eldest son, andsaid unto him, My son: and he said unto him, Behold, [here am] I.

{27:2} And he said, Behold now, I am old, I know not the day of mydeath: 

{27:3} Now therefore take, I pray thee, thy weapons, thy quiverand thy bow, and go out to the field, and take me [some] venison;

{27:4} And make me savoury meat, such as I love, and bring [it] to me,that I may eat; that my soul may bless thee before I die. 

{27:5} AndRebekah heard when Isaac spake to Esau his son. And Esau went to thefield to hunt [for] venison, [and] to bring [it.]   

{27:6} And Rebekah spake unto Jacob her son, saying, Behold, I heardthy father speak unto Esau thy brother, saying, 

{27:7} Bring mevenison, and make me savoury meat, that I may eat, and bless theebefore the LORD before my death. 

{27:8} Now therefore, my son, obey myvoice according to that which I command thee. 

{27:9} Go now to theflock, and fetch me from thence two good kids of the goats; and I willmake them savoury meat for thy father, such as he loveth: 

{27:10} Andthou shalt bring [it] to thy father, that he may eat, and that he maybless thee before his death. 

{27:11} And Jacob said to Rebekah hismother, Behold, Esau my brother [is] a hairy man, and I [am] a smoothman: 

{27:12} My father peradventure will feel me, and I shall seem tohim as a deceiver; and I shall bring a curse upon me, and not ablessing. 

{27:13} And his mother said unto him, Upon me [be] thy curse,my son: only obey my voice, and go fetch me [them. ]

{27:14} And hewent, and fetched, and brought [them] to his mother: and his mothermade savoury meat, such as his father loved. 

{27:15} And Rebekah tookgoodly raiment of her eldest son Esau, which [were] with her in thehouse, and put them upon Jacob her younger son: 

{27:16} And she put theskins of the kids of the goats upon his hands, and upon the smooth ofhis neck: 

{27:17} And she gave the savoury meat and the bread, whichshe had prepared, into the hand of her son Jacob.   

{27:18} And he came unto his father, and said, My father: and hesaid, Here [am] I; who [art] thou, my son? 

{27:19} And Jacob said untohis father, I [am] Esau thy firstborn; I have done according as thoubadest me: arise, I pray thee, sit and eat of my venison, that thy soulmay bless me. 

{27:20} And Isaac said unto his son, How [is it] thatthou hast found [it] so quickly, my son? And he said, Because the LORDthy God brought [it] to me. 

{27:21} And Isaac said unto Jacob, Comenear, I pray thee, that I may feel thee, my son, whether thou [be] myvery son Esau or not. 

{27:22} And Jacob went near unto Isaac hisfather; and he felt him, and said, The voice [is] Jacob's voice, butthe hands [are] the hands of Esau. 

{27:23} And he discerned him not,because his hands were hairy, as his brother Esau's hands: so heblessed him. 

{27:24} And he said, [Art] thou my very son Esau? And hesaid, I [am. ]

{27:25} And he said, Bring [it] near to me, and I willeat of my son's venison, that my soul may bless thee. And he brought[it] near to him, and he did eat: and he brought him wine, and hedrank. 

{27:26} And his father Isaac said unto him, Come near now, andkiss me, my son. 

{27:27} And he came near, and kissed him: and hesmelled the smell of his raiment, and blessed him, and said, See, thesmell of my son [is] as the smell of a field which the LORD hathblessed: 

{27:28} Therefore God give thee of the dew of heaven, and thefatness of the earth, and plenty of corn and wine: 

{27:29} Let peopleserve thee, and nations bow down to thee: be lord over thy brethren,and let thy mother's sons bow down to thee: cursed [be] every one thatcurseth thee, and blessed [be] he that blesseth thee.   

{27:30} And it came to pass, as soon as Isaac had made an end ofblessing Jacob, and Jacob was yet scarce gone out from the presence ofIsaac his father, that Esau his brother came in from his hunting.

{27:31} And he also had made savoury meat, and brought it unto hisfather, and said unto his father, Let my father arise, and eat of hisson's venison, that thy soul may bless me. 

{27:32} And Isaac his fathersaid unto him, Who [art] thou? And he said, I [am] thy son, thyfirstborn Esau. 

{27:33} And Isaac trembled very exceedingly, and said,Who? where [is] he that hath taken venison, and brought [it] me, and Ihave eaten of all before thou camest, and have blessed him? yea, [and]he shall be blessed. 

{27:34} And when Esau heard the words of hisfather, he cried with a great and exceeding bitter cry, and said untohis father, Bless me, [even] me also, O my father. 

{27:35} And he said,Thy brother came with subtilty, and hath taken away thy blessing.

{27:36} And he said, Is not he rightly named Jacob? for he hathsupplanted me these two times: he took away my birthright; and, behold,now he hath taken away my blessing. And he said, Hast thou not reserveda blessing for me? 

{27:37} And Isaac answered and said unto Esau,Behold, I have made him thy lord, and all his brethren have I given tohim for servants; and with corn and wine have I sustained him: and whatshall I do now unto thee, my son? 

{27:38} And Esau said unto hisfather, Hast thou but one blessing, my father? bless me, [even] mealso, O my father. And Esau lifted up his voice, and wept. 

{27:39} AndIsaac his father answered and said unto him, Behold, thy dwelling shallbe the fatness of the earth, and of the dew of heaven from above;

{27:40} And by thy sword shalt thou live, and shalt serve thy brother;and it shall come to pass when thou shalt have the dominion, that thoushalt break his yoke from off thy neck.   

{27:41} And Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing wherewith hisfather blessed him: and Esau said in his heart, The days of mourningfor my father are at hand; then will I slay my brother Jacob. 

{27:42}And these words of Esau her elder son were told to Rebekah: and shesent and called Jacob her younger son, and said unto him, Behold, thybrother Esau, as touching thee, doth comfort himself, [purposing] tokill thee. 

{27:43} Now therefore, my son, obey my voice; and arise,flee thou to Laban my brother to Haran; 

{27:44} And tarry with him afew days, until thy brother's fury turn away; 

{27:45} Until thybrother's anger turn away from thee, and he forget [that] which thouhast done to him: then I will send, and fetch thee from thence: whyshould I be deprived also of you both in one day? 

{27:46} And Rebekahsaid to Isaac, I am weary of my life because of the daughters of Heth:if Jacob take a wife of the daughters of Heth, such as these [whichare] of the daughters of the land, what good shall my life do me?   

{28:1} And Isaac called Jacob, and blessed him, and charged him, andsaid unto him, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan.

{28:2} Arise, go to Padan-aram, to the house of Bethuel thy mother'sfather; and take thee a wife from thence of the daughters of Laban thymother's brother. 

{28:3} And God Almighty bless thee, and make theefruitful, and multiply thee, that thou mayest be a multitude of people;

{28:4} And give thee the blessing of Abraham, to thee, and to thy seedwith thee; that thou mayest inherit the land wherein thou art astranger, which God gave unto Abraham. 

{28:5} And Isaac sent awayJacob: and he went to Padan-aram unto Laban, son of Bethuel the Syrian,the brother of Rebekah, Jacob's and Esau's mother.   

{28:6} When Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob, and sent him awayto Padan-aram, to take him a wife from thence; and that as he blessedhim he gave him a charge, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife of thedaughters of Canaan; 

{28:7} And that Jacob obeyed his father and hismother, and was gone to Padan-aram; 

{28:8} And Esau seeing that thedaughters of Canaan pleased not Isaac his father; 

{28:9} Then went Esauunto Ishmael, and took unto the wives which he had Mahalath thedaughter of Ishmael Abraham's son, the sister of Nebajoth, to be hiswife.   

{28:10} And Jacob went out from Beer-sheba, and went toward Haran.

{28:11} And he lighted upon a certain place, and tarried there allnight, because the sun was set; and he took of the stones of thatplace, and [put] them for his pillows, and lay down in that place tosleep. 

{28:12} And he dreamed, and behold a ladder set up on the earth,and the top of it reached to heaven: and behold the angels of Godascending and descending on it. 

{28:13} And, behold, the LORD stoodabove it, and said, I [am] the LORD God of Abraham thy father, and theGod of Isaac: the land whereon thou liest, to thee will I give it, andto thy seed; 

{28:14} And thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth,and thou shalt spread abroad to the west, and to the east, and to thenorth, and to the south: and in thee and in thy seed shall all thefamilies of the earth be blessed. 

{28:15} And, behold, I [am] withthee, and will keep thee in all [places] whither thou goest, and willbring thee again into this land; for I will not leave thee, until Ihave done [that] which I have spoken to thee of.   

{28:16} And Jacob awaked out of his sleep, and he said, Surely theLORD is in this place; and I knew [it] not. 

{28:17} And he was afraid,and said, How dreadful [is] this place! this is none other but thehouse of God, and this [is] the gate of heaven. 

{28:18} And Jacob roseup early in the morning, and took the stone that he had put [for] hispillows, and set it up [for] a pillar, and poured oil upon the top ofit. 

{28:19} And he called the name of that place Bethel: but the nameof that city [was called] Luz at the first. 

{28:20} And Jacob vowed avow, saying, If God will be with me, and will keep me in this way thatI go, and will give me bread to eat, and raiment to put on, 

{28:21} Sothat I come again to my father's house in peace; then shall the LORD bemy God: 

{28:22} And this stone, which I have set [for] a pillar, shallbe God's house: and of all that thou shalt give me I will surely givethe tenth unto thee.   

{29:1} Then Jacob went on his journey, and came into the land of thepeople of the east. 

{29:2} And he looked, and behold a well in thefield, and, lo, there [were] three flocks of sheep lying by it; for outof that well they watered the flocks: and a great stone [was] upon thewell's mouth. 

{29:3} And thither were all the flocks gathered: and theyrolled the stone from the well's mouth, and watered the sheep, and putthe stone again upon the well's mouth in his place. 

{29:4} And Jacobsaid unto them, My brethren, whence [be] ye? And they said, Of Haran[are] we. 

{29:5} And he said unto them, Know ye Laban the son of Nahor?And they said, We know [him. ]

{29:6} And he said unto them, [Is] hewell? And they said, [He is] well: and, behold, Rachel his daughtercometh with the sheep. 

{29:7} And he said, Lo, [it is] yet high day,neither [is it] time that the cattle should be gathered together: waterye the sheep, and go [and] feed [them. ]

{29:8} And they said, Wecannot, until all the flocks be gathered together, and [till] they rollthe stone from the well's mouth; then we water the sheep.   

{29:9} And while he yet spake with them, Rachel came with herfather's sheep: for she kept them. 

{29:10} And it came to pass, whenJacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mother's brother, and thesheep of Laban his mother's brother, that Jacob went near, and rolledthe stone from the well's mouth, and watered the flock of Laban hismother's brother. 

{29:11} And Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up hisvoice, and wept. 

{29:12} And Jacob told Rachel that he [was] herfather's brother, and that he [was] Rebekah's son: and she ran and toldher father. 

{29:13} And it came to pass, when Laban heard the tidingsof Jacob his sister's son, that he ran to meet him, and embraced him,and kissed him, and brought him to his house. And he told Laban allthese things. 

{29:14} And Laban said to him, Surely thou [art] my boneand my flesh. And he abode with him the space of a month.   

{29:15} And Laban said unto Jacob, Because thou [art] my brother,shouldest thou therefore serve me for nought? tell me, what [shall] thywages [be? ]

{29:16} And Laban had two daughters: the name of the elder[was] Leah, and the name of the younger [was] Rachel. 

{29:17} Leah[was] tender eyed; but Rachel was beautiful and well favoured. 

{29:18}And Jacob loved Rachel; and said, I will serve thee seven years forRachel thy younger daughter. 

{29:19} And Laban said, [It is] betterthat I give her to thee, than that I should give her to another man:abide with me. 

{29:20} And Jacob served seven years for Rachel; andthey seemed unto him [but] a few days, for the love he had to her.   

{29:21} And Jacob said unto Laban, Give [me] my wife, for my daysare fulfilled, that I may go in unto her. 

{29:22} And Laban gatheredtogether all the men of the place, and made a feast. 

{29:23} And itcame to pass in the evening, that he took Leah his daughter, andbrought her to him; and he went in unto her. 

{29:24} And Laban gaveunto his daughter Leah Zilpah his maid [for] an handmaid. 

{29:25} Andit came to pass, that in the morning, behold, it [was] Leah: and hesaid to Laban, What [is] this thou hast done unto me? did not I servewith thee for Rachel? wherefore then hast thou beguiled me? 

{29:26} AndLaban said, It must not be so done in our country, to give the youngerbefore the firstborn. 

{29:27} Fulfil her week, and we will give theethis also for the service which thou shalt serve with me yet sevenother years. 

{29:28} And Jacob did so, and fulfilled her week: and hegave him Rachel his daughter to wife also. 

{29:29} And Laban gave toRachel his daughter Bilhah his handmaid to be her maid. 

{29:30} And hewent in also unto Rachel, and he loved also Rachel more than Leah, andserved with him yet seven other years.   

{29:31} And when the LORD saw that Leah [was] hated, he opened herwomb: but Rachel [was] barren. 

{29:32} And Leah conceived, and bare ason, and she called his name Reuben: for she said, Surely the LORD hathlooked upon my affliction; now therefore my husband will love me.

{29:33} And she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Because theLORD hath heard that I [was] hated, he hath therefore given me this[son] also: and she called his name Simeon. 

{29:34} And she conceivedagain, and bare a son; and said, Now this time will my husband bejoined unto me, because I have born him three sons: therefore was hisname called Levi. 

{29:35} And she conceived again, and bare a son: andshe said, Now will I praise the LORD: therefore she called his nameJudah; and left bearing.   

{30:1} And when Rachel saw that she bare Jacob no children, Rachelenvied her sister; and said unto Jacob, Give me children, or else Idie. 

{30:2} And Jacob's anger was kindled against Rachel: and he said,[Am] I in God's stead, who hath withheld from thee the fruit of thewomb? 

{30:3} And she said, Behold my maid Bilhah, go in unto her; andshe shall bear upon my knees that I may also have children by her.

{30:4} And she gave him Bilhah her handmaid to wife: and Jacob went inunto her. 

{30:5} And Bilhah conceived, and bare Jacob a son. 

{30:6} AndRachel said, God hath judged me, and hath also heard my voice, and hathgiven me a son: therefore called she his name Dan. 

{30:7} And BilhahRachel's maid conceived again, and bare Jacob a second son. 

{30:8} AndRachel said, With great wrestlings have I wrestled with my sister, andI have prevailed: and she called his name Naphtali. 

{30:9} When Leahsaw that she had left bearing, she took Zilpah her maid, and gave herJacob to wife. 

{30:10} And Zilpah Leah's maid bare Jacob a son. 

{30:11}And Leah said, A troop cometh: and she called his name Gad. 

{30:12} AndZilpah Leah's maid bare Jacob a second son. 

{30:13} And Leah said,Happy am I, for the daughters will call me blessed: and she called hisname Asher.   

{30:14} And Reuben went in the days of wheat harvest, and foundmandrakes in the field, and brought them unto his mother Leah. ThenRachel said to Leah, Give me, I pray thee, of thy son's mandrakes.

{30:15} And she said unto her, [Is it] a small matter that thou hasttaken my husband? and wouldest thou take away my son's mandrakes also?And Rachel said, Therefore he shall lie with thee to night for thyson's mandrakes. 

{30:16} And Jacob came out of the field in theevening, and Leah went out to meet him, and said, Thou must come inunto me; for surely I have hired thee with my son's mandrakes. And helay with her that night. 

{30:17} And God hearkened unto Leah, and sheconceived, and bare Jacob the fifth son. 

{30:18} And Leah said, Godhath given me my hire, because I have given my maiden to my husband:and she called his name Issachar. 

{30:19} And Leah conceived again, andbare Jacob the sixth son. 

{30:20} And Leah said, God hath endued me[with] a good dowry; now will my husband dwell with me, because I haveborn him six sons: and she called his name Zebulun. 

{30:21} Andafterwards she bare a daughter, and called her name Dinah.   

{30:22} And God remembered Rachel, and God hearkened to her, andopened her womb. 

{30:23} And she conceived, and bare a son; and said,God hath taken away my reproach: 

{30:24} And she called his nameJoseph; and said, The LORD shall add to me another son.   

{30:25} And it came to pass, when Rachel had born Joseph, that Jacobsaid unto Laban, Send me away, that I may go unto mine own place, andto my country. 

{30:26} Give [me] my wives and my children, for whom Ihave served thee, and let me go: for thou knowest my service which Ihave done thee. 

{30:27} And Laban said unto him, I pray thee, if I havefound favour in thine eyes, [tarry: for] I have learned by experiencethat the LORD hath blessed me for thy sake. 

{30:28} And he said,Appoint me thy wages, and I will give [it. ]

{30:29} And he said untohim, Thou knowest how I have served thee, and how thy cattle was withme. 

{30:30} For [it was] little which thou hadst before I [came,] andit is [now] increased unto a multitude; and the LORD hath blessed theesince my coming: and now when shall I provide for mine own house also?

{30:31} And he said, What shall I give thee? And Jacob said, Thou shaltnot give me any thing: if thou wilt do this thing for me, I will againfeed [and] keep thy flock: 

{30:32} I will pass through all thy flock today, removing from thence all the speckled and spotted cattle, and allthe brown cattle among the sheep, and the spotted and speckled amongthe goats: and [of such] shall be my hire. 

{30:33} So shall myrighteousness answer for me in time to come, when it shall come for myhire before thy face: every one that [is] not speckled and spottedamong the goats, and brown among the sheep, that shall be countedstolen with me. 

{30:34} And Laban said, Behold, I would it might beaccording to thy word. 

{30:35} And he removed that day the he goatsthat were ringstraked and spotted, and all the she goats that werespeckled and spotted, [and] every one that had [some] white in it, andall the brown among the sheep, and gave [them] into the hand of hissons. 

{30:36} And he set three days journey betwixt himself and Jacob:and Jacob fed the rest of Laban's flocks.   

{30:37} And Jacob took him rods of green poplar, and of the hazeland chesnut tree; and pilled white strakes in them, and made the whiteappear which [was] in the rods. 

{30:38} And he set the rods which hehad pilled before the flocks in the gutters in the watering troughswhen the flocks came to drink, that they should conceive when they cameto drink. 

{30:39} And the flocks conceived before the rods, and broughtforth cattle ringstraked, speckled, and spotted. 

{30:40} And Jacob didseparate the lambs, and set the faces of the flocks toward theringstraked, and all the brown in the flock of Laban; and he put hisown flocks by themselves, and put them not unto Laban's cattle. 

{30:41}And it came to pass, whensoever the stronger cattle did conceive, thatJacob laid the rods before the eyes of the cattle in the gutters, thatthey might conceive among the rods. 

{30:42} But when the cattle werefeeble, he put [them] not in: so the feebler were Laban's, and thestronger Jacob's. 

{30:43} And the man increased exceedingly, and hadmuch cattle, and maidservants, and menservants, and camels, and asses.   

{31:1} And he heard the words of Laban's sons, saying, Jacob hathtaken away all that [was] our father's; and of [that] which [was] ourfather's hath he gotten all this glory. 

{31:2} And Jacob beheld thecountenance of Laban, and, behold, it [was] not toward him as before.

{31:3} And the LORD said unto Jacob, Return unto the land of thyfathers, and to thy kindred; and I will be with thee. 

{31:4} And Jacobsent and called Rachel and Leah to the field unto his flock, 

{31:5} Andsaid unto them, I see your father's countenance, that it [is] nottoward me as before; but the God of my father hath been with me. 

{31:6}And ye know that with all my power I have served your father. 

{31:7}And your father hath deceived me, and changed my wages ten times; butGod suffered him not to hurt me. 

{31:8} If he said thus, The speckledshall be thy wages; then all the cattle bare speckled: and if he saidthus, The ringstraked shall be thy hire; then bare all the cattleringstraked. 

{31:9} Thus God hath taken away the cattle of your father,and given [them] to me. 

{31:10} And it came to pass at the time thatthe cattle conceived, that I lifted up mine eyes, and saw in a dream,and, behold, the rams which leaped upon the cattle [were] ringstraked,speckled, and grisled. 

{31:11} And the angel of God spake unto me in adream, [saying,] Jacob: And I said, Here [am] I. 

{31:12} And he said,Lift up now thine eyes, and see, all the rams which leap upon thecattle [are] ringstraked, speckled, and grisled: for I have seen allthat Laban doeth unto thee. 

{31:13} I [am] the God of Bethel, wherethou anointedst the pillar, [and] where thou vowedst a vow unto me: nowarise, get thee out from this land, and return unto the land of thykindred. 

{31:14} And Rachel and Leah answered and said unto him, [Isthere] yet any portion or inheritance for us in our father's house?

{31:15} Are we not counted of him strangers? for he hath sold us, andhath quite devoured also our money. 

{31:16} For all the riches whichGod hath taken from our father, that [is] ours, and our children's: nowthen, whatsoever God hath said unto thee, do.   

{31:17} Then Jacob rose up, and set his sons and his wives uponcamels; 

{31:18} And he carried away all his cattle, and all his goodswhich he had gotten, the cattle of his getting, which he had gotten inPadan-aram, for to go to Isaac his father in the land of Canaan.

{31:19} And Laban went to shear his sheep: and Rachel had stolen theimages that [were] her father's. 

{31:20} And Jacob stole away unawaresto Laban the Syrian, in that he told him not that he fled. 

{31:21} Sohe fled with all that he had; and he rose up, and passed over theriver, and set his face [toward] the mount Gilead. 

{31:22} And it wastold Laban on the third day that Jacob was fled. 

{31:23} And he tookhis brethren with him, and pursued after him seven days' journey; andthey overtook him in the mount Gilead. 

{31:24} And God came to Labanthe Syrian in a dream by night, and said unto him, Take heed that thouspeak not to Jacob either good or bad.   

{31:25} Then Laban overtook Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent inthe mount: and Laban with his brethren pitched in the mount of Gilead.

{31:26} And Laban said to Jacob, What hast thou done, that thou haststolen away unawares to me, and carried away my daughters, as captives[taken] with the sword? 

{31:27} Wherefore didst thou flee awaysecretly, and steal away from me; and didst not tell me, that I mighthave sent thee away with mirth, and with songs, with tabret, and withharp? 

{31:28} And hast not suffered me to kiss my sons and mydaughters? thou hast now done foolishly in so doing. 

{31:29} It is inthe power of my hand to do you hurt: but the God of your father spakeunto me yesternight, saying, Take thou heed that thou speak not toJacob either good or bad. 

{31:30} And now, [though] thou wouldest needsbe gone, because thou sore longedst after thy father's house, [yet]wherefore hast thou stolen my gods? 

{31:31} And Jacob answered and saidto Laban, Because I was afraid: for I said, Peradventure thou wouldesttake by force thy daughters from me. 

{31:32} With whomsoever thoufindest thy gods, let him not live: before our brethren discern thouwhat [is] thine with me, and take [it] to thee. For Jacob knew not thatRachel had stolen them. 

{31:33} And Laban went into Jacob's tent, andinto Leah's tent, and into the two maidservants' tents; but he found[them] not. Then went he out of Leah's tent, and entered into Rachel'stent. 

{31:34} Now Rachel had taken the images, and put them in thecamel's furniture, and sat upon them. And Laban searched all the tent,but found [them] not. 

{31:35} And she said to her father, Let it notdisplease my lord that I cannot rise up before thee; for the custom ofwomen is upon me. And he searched, but found not the images.   

{31:36} And Jacob was wroth, and chode with Laban: and Jacobanswered and said to Laban, What [is] my trespass? what [is] my sin,that thou hast so hotly pursued after me? 

{31:37} Whereas thou hastsearched all my stuff, what hast thou found of all thy household stuff?set [it] here before my brethren and thy brethren, that they may judgebetwixt us both. 

{31:38} This twenty years [have] I [been] with thee;thy ewes and thy she goats have not cast their young, and the rams ofthy flock have I not eaten. 

{31:39} That which was torn [of beasts] Ibrought not unto thee; I bare the loss of it; of my hand didst thourequire it, [whether] stolen by day, or stolen by night. 

{31:40} [Thus]I was; in the day the drought consumed me, and the frost by night; andmy sleep departed from mine eyes. 

{31:41} Thus have I been twenty yearsin thy house; I served thee fourteen years for thy two daughters, andsix years for thy cattle: and thou hast changed my wages ten times.

{31:42} Except the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fearof Isaac, had been with me, surely thou hadst sent me away now empty.God hath seen mine affliction and the labour of my hands, and rebuked[thee] yesternight.   

{31:43} And Laban answered and said unto Jacob, [These] daughters[are] my daughters, and [these] children [are] my children, and [these]cattle [are] my cattle, and all that thou seest [is] mine: and what canI do this day unto these my daughters, or unto their children whichthey have born? 

{31:44} Now therefore come thou, let us make acovenant, I and thou; and let it be for a witness between me and thee.

{31:45} And Jacob took a stone, and set it up [for] a pillar. 

{31:46}And Jacob said unto his brethren, Gather stones; and they took stones,and made an heap: and they did eat there upon the heap. 

{31:47} AndLaban called it Jegar-sahadutha: but Jacob called it Galeed. 

{31:48}And Laban said, This heap [is] a witness between me and thee this day.Therefore was the name of it called Galeed; 

{31:49} And Mizpah; for hesaid, The LORD watch between me and thee, when we are absent one fromanother. 

{31:50} If thou shalt afflict my daughters, or if thou shalttake [other] wives beside my daughters, no man [is] with us; see, God[is] witness betwixt me and thee. 

{31:51} And Laban said to Jacob,Behold this heap, and behold [this] pillar, which I have cast betwixtme and thee; 

{31:52} This heap [be] witness, and [this] pillar [be]witness, that I will not pass over this heap to thee, and that thoushalt not pass over this heap and this pillar unto me, for harm.

{31:53} The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of theirfather, judge betwixt us. And Jacob sware by the fear of his fatherIsaac. 

{31:54} Then Jacob offered sacrifice upon the mount, and calledhis brethren to eat bread: and they did eat bread, and tarried allnight in the mount. 

{31:55} And early in the morning Laban rose up, andkissed his sons and his daughters, and blessed them: and Labandeparted, and returned unto his place.   

{32:1} And Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him.

{32:2} And when Jacob saw them, he said, This [is] God's host: and hecalled the name of that place Mahanaim. 

{32:3} And Jacob sentmessengers before him to Esau his brother unto the land of Seir, thecountry of Edom. 

{32:4} And he commanded them, saying, Thus shall yespeak unto my lord Esau; Thy servant Jacob saith thus, I have sojournedwith Laban, and stayed there until now: 

{32:5} And I have oxen, andasses, flocks, and menservants, and womenservants: and I have sent totell my lord, that I may find grace in thy sight.   

{32:6} And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to thybrother Esau, and also he cometh to meet thee, and four hundred menwith him. 

{32:7} Then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed: and hedivided the people that [was] with him, and the flocks, and herds, andthe camels, into two bands; 

{32:8} And said, If Esau come to the onecompany, and smite it, then the other company which is left shallescape.   

{32:9} And Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham, and God of myfather Isaac, the LORD which saidst unto me, Return unto thy country,and to thy kindred, and I will deal well with thee: 

{32:10} I am notworthy of the least of all the mercies, and of all the truth, whichthou hast shewed unto thy servant; for with my staff I passed over thisJordan; and now I am become two bands. 

{32:11} Deliver me, I pray thee,from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau: for I fear him,lest he will come and smite me, [and] the mother with the children.

{32:12} And thou saidst, I will surely do thee good, and make thy seedas the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude. 

{32:13}And he lodged there that same night; and took of that which came to hishand a present for Esau his brother; 

{32:14} Two hundred she goats, andtwenty he goats, two hundred ewes, and twenty rams, 

{32:15} Thirtymilch camels with their colts, forty kine, and ten bulls, twenty sheasses, and ten foals. 

{32:16} And he delivered [them] into the hand ofhis servants, every drove by themselves; and said unto his servants,Pass over before me, and put a space betwixt drove and drove. 

{32:17}And he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau my brother meeteththee, and asketh thee, saying, Whose [art] thou? and whither goestthou? and whose [are] these before thee? 

{32:18} Then thou shalt say,[They be] thy servant Jacob's; it [is] a present sent unto my lordEsau: and, behold, also he [is] behind us. 

{32:19} And so commanded hethe second, and the third, and all that followed the droves, saying, Onthis manner shall ye speak unto Esau, when ye find him. 

{32:20} And sayye moreover, Behold, thy servant Jacob [is] behind us. For he said, Iwill appease him with the present that goeth before me, and afterward Iwill see his face; peradventure he will accept of me. 

{32:21} So wentthe present over before him: and himself lodged that night in thecompany. 

{32:22} And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, andhis two womenservants, and his eleven sons, and passed over the fordJabbok. 

{32:23} And he took them, and sent them over the brook, andsent over that he had.   

{32:24} And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with himuntil the breaking of the day. 

{32:25} And when he saw that heprevailed not against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh; and thehollow of Jacob's thigh was out of joint, as he wrestled with him.

{32:26} And he said, Let me go, for the day breaketh. And he said, Iwill not let thee go, except thou bless me. 

{32:27} And he said untohim, What [is] thy name? And he said, Jacob. 

{32:28} And he said, Thyname shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel: for as a prince hastthou power with God and with men, and hast prevailed. 

{32:29} And Jacobasked [him,] and said, Tell [me,] I pray thee, thy name. And he said,Wherefore [is] it [that] thou dost ask after my name? And he blessedhim there. 

{32:30} And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: for Ihave seen God face to face, and my life is preserved. 

{32:31} And as hepassed over Penuel the sun rose upon him, and he halted upon his thigh.

{32:32} Therefore the children of Israel eat not [of] the sinew whichshrank, which [is] upon the hollow of the thigh, unto this day: becausehe touched the hollow of Jacob's thigh in the sinew that shrank.   

{33:1} And Jacob lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, Esaucame, and with him four hundred men. And he divided the children untoLeah, and unto Rachel, and unto the two handmaids. 

{33:2} And he putthe handmaids and their children foremost, and Leah and her childrenafter, and Rachel and Joseph hindermost. 

{33:3} And he passed overbefore them, and bowed himself to the ground seven times, until he camenear to his brother. 

{33:4} And Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him,and fell on his neck, and kissed him: and they wept. 

{33:5} And helifted up his eyes, and saw the women and the children; and said, Who[are] those with thee? And he said, The children which God hathgraciously given thy servant. 

{33:6} Then the handmaidens came near,they and their children, and they bowed themselves. 

{33:7} And Leahalso with her children came near, and bowed themselves: and after cameJoseph near and Rachel, and they bowed themselves. 

{33:8} And he said,What [meanest] thou by all this drove which I met? And he said, [Theseare] to find grace in the sight of my lord. 

{33:9} And Esau said, Ihave enough, my brother; keep that thou hast unto thyself. 

{33:10} AndJacob said, Nay, I pray thee, if now I have found grace in thy sight,then receive my present at my hand: for therefore I have seen thy face,as though I had seen the face of God, and thou wast pleased with me.

{33:11} Take, I pray thee, my blessing that is brought to thee; becauseGod hath dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough. And heurged him, and he took [it. ]

{33:12} And he said, Let us take ourjourney, and let us go, and I will go before thee. 

{33:13} And he saidunto him, My lord knoweth that the children [are] tender, and theflocks and herds with young [are] with me: and if men should overdrivethem one day, all the flock will die. 

{33:14} Let my lord, I pray thee,pass over before his servant: and I will lead on softly, according asthe cattle that goeth before me and the children be able to endure,until I come unto my lord unto Seir. 

{33:15} And Esau said, Let me nowleave with thee [some] of the folk that [are] with me. And he said,What needeth it? let me find grace in the sight of my lord.   

{33:16} So Esau returned that day on his way unto Seir. 

{33:17} AndJacob journeyed to Succoth, and built him an house, and made booths forhis cattle: therefore the name of the place is called Succoth.   

{33:18} And Jacob came to Shalem, a city of Shechem, which [is] inthe land of Canaan, when he came from Padan-aram; and pitched his tentbefore the city. 

{33:19} And he bought a parcel of a field, where hehad spread his tent, at the hand of the children of Hamor, Shechem'sfather, for an hundred pieces of money. 

{33:20} And he erected there analtar, and called it El-elohe-Israel.   

{34:1} And Dinah the daughter of Leah, which she bare unto Jacob,went out to see the daughters of the land. 

{34:2} And when Shechem theson of Hamor the Hivite, prince of the country, saw her, he took her,and lay with her, and defiled her. 

{34:3} And his soul clave unto Dinahthe daughter of Jacob, and he loved the damsel, and spake kindly untothe damsel. 

{34:4} And Shechem spake unto his father Hamor, saying, Getme this damsel to wife. 

{34:5} And Jacob heard that he had defiledDinah his daughter: now his sons were with his cattle in the field: andJacob held his peace until they were come.   

{34:6} And Hamor the father of Shechem went out unto Jacob tocommune with him. 

{34:7} And the sons of Jacob came out of the fieldwhen they heard [it:] and the men were grieved, and they were verywroth, because he had wrought folly in Israel in lying with Jacob'sdaughter; which thing ought not to be done. 

{34:8} And Hamor communedwith them, saying, The soul of my son Shechem longeth for yourdaughter: I pray you give her him to wife. 

{34:9} And make ye marriageswith us, [and] give your daughters unto us, and take our daughters untoyou. 

{34:10} And ye shall dwell with us: and the land shall be beforeyou; dwell and trade ye therein, and get you possessions therein.

{34:11} And Shechem said unto her father and unto her brethren, Let mefind grace in your eyes, and what ye shall say unto me I will give.

{34:12} Ask me never so much dowry and gift, and I will give accordingas ye shall say unto me: but give me the damsel to wife. 

{34:13} Andthe sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father deceitfully,and said, because he had defiled Dinah their sister: 

{34:14} And theysaid unto them, We cannot do this thing, to give our sister to one thatis uncircumcised; for that [were] a reproach unto us: 

{34:15} But inthis will we consent unto you: If ye will be as we [be,] that everymale of you be circumcised; 

{34:16} Then will we give our daughtersunto you, and we will take your daughters to us, and we will dwell withyou, and we will become one people. 

{34:17} But if ye will not hearkenunto us, to be circumcised; then will we take our daughter, and we willbe gone. 

{34:18} And their words pleased Hamor, and Shechem Hamor'sson. 

{34:19} And the young man deferred not to do the thing, because hehad delight in Jacob's daughter: and he [was] more honourable than allthe house of his father.   

{34:20} And Hamor and Shechem his son came unto the gate of theircity, and communed with the men of their city, saying, 

{34:21} Thesemen [are] peaceable with us; therefore let them dwell in the land, andtrade therein; for the land, behold, [it is] large enough for them; letus take their daughters to us for wives, and let us give them ourdaughters. 

{34:22} Only herein will the men consent unto us for todwell with us, to be one people, if every male among us be circumcised,as they [are] circumcised. 

{34:23} [Shall] not their cattle and theirsubstance and every beast of theirs [be] ours? only let us consent untothem, and they will dwell with us. 

{34:24} And unto Hamor and untoShechem his son hearkened all that went out of the gate of his city;and every male was circumcised, all that went out of the gate of hiscity.   

{34:25} And it came to pass on the third day, when they were sore,that two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinah's brethren, tookeach man his sword, and came upon the city boldly, and slew all themales. 

{34:26} And they slew Hamor and Shechem his son with the edge ofthe sword, and took Dinah out of Shechem's house, and went out. 

{34:27}The sons of Jacob came upon the slain, and spoiled the city, becausethey had defiled their sister. 

{34:28} They took their sheep, and theiroxen, and their asses, and that which [was] in the city, and that which[was] in the field, 

{34:29} And all their wealth, and all their littleones, and their wives took they captive, and spoiled even all that[was] in the house. 

{34:30} And Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, Ye havetroubled me to make me to stink among the inhabitants of the land,among the Canaanites and the Perizzites: and I [being] few in number,they shall gather themselves together against me, and slay me; and Ishall be destroyed, I and my house. 

{34:31} And they said, Should hedeal with our sister as with an harlot?   

{35:1} And God said unto Jacob, Arise, go up to Bethel, and dwellthere: and make there an altar unto God, that appeared unto thee whenthou fleddest from the face of Esau thy brother. 

{35:2} Then Jacob saidunto his household, and to all that [were] with him, Put away thestrange gods that [are] among you, and be clean, and change yourgarments: 

{35:3} And let us arise, and go up to Bethel; and I will makethere an altar unto God, who answered me in the day of my distress, andwas with me in the way which I went. 

{35:4} And they gave unto Jacoball the strange gods which [were] in their hand, and [all their]earrings which [were] in their ears; and Jacob hid them under the oakwhich [was] by Shechem. 

{35:5} And they journeyed: and the terror ofGod was upon the cities that [were] round about them, and they did notpursue after the sons of Jacob.   

{35:6} So Jacob came to Luz, which [is] in the land of Canaan, that[is,] Bethel, he and all the people that [were] with him. 

{35:7} And hebuilt there an altar, and called the place El-beth-el: because thereGod appeared unto him, when he fled from the face of his brother.

{35:8} But Deborah Rebekah's nurse died, and she was buried beneathBethel under an oak: and the name of it was called Allon-bachuth.   

{35:9} And God appeared unto Jacob again, when he came out ofPadan-aram, and blessed him. 

{35:10} And God said unto him, Thy name[is] Jacob: thy name shall not be called any more Jacob, but Israelshall be thy name: and he called his name Israel. 

{35:11} And God saidunto him, I [am] God Almighty: be fruitful and multiply; a nation and acompany of nations shall be of thee, and kings shall come out of thyloins; 

{35:12} And the land which I gave Abraham and Isaac, to thee Iwill give it, and to thy seed after thee will I give the land. 

{35:13}And God went up from him in the place where he talked with him. 

{35:14}And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he talked with him, [even]a pillar of stone: and he poured a drink offering thereon, and hepoured oil thereon. 

{35:15} And Jacob called the name of the placewhere God spake with him, Bethel.   

{35:16} And they journeyed from Bethel; and there was but a littleway to come to Ephrath: and Rachel travailed, and she had hard labour.

{35:17} And it came to pass, when she was in hard labour, that themidwife said unto her, Fear not; thou shalt have this son also. 

{35:18}And it came to pass, as her soul was in departing, (for she died) thatshe called his name Ben-oni: but his father called him Benjamin.

{35:19} And Rachel died, and was buried in the way to Ephrath, which[is] Bethlehem. 

{35:20} And Jacob set a pillar upon her grave: that[is] the pillar of Rachel's grave unto this day.   

{35:21} And Israel journeyed, and spread his tent beyond the towerof Edar. 

{35:22} And it came to pass, when Israel dwelt in that land,that Reuben went and lay with Bilhah his father's concubine: and Israelheard [it.] Now the sons of Jacob were twelve: 

{35:23} The sons ofLeah; Reuben, Jacob's firstborn, and Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, andIssachar, and Zebulun: 

{35:24} The sons of Rachel; Joseph, andBenjamin: 

{35:25} And the sons of Bilhah, Rachel's handmaid; Dan, andNaphtali: 

{35:26} And the sons of Zilpah, Leah's handmaid; Gad, andAsher: these [are] the sons of Jacob, which were born to him inPadan-aram.   

{35:27} And Jacob came unto Isaac his father unto Mamre, unto thecity of Arbah, which [is] Hebron, where Abraham and Isaac sojourned.

{35:28} And the days of Isaac were an hundred and fourscore years.

{35:29} And Isaac gave up the ghost, and died, and was gathered untohis people, [being] old and full of days: and his sons Esau and Jacobburied him.   

{36:1} Now these [are] the generations of Esau, who [is] Edom.

{36:2} Esau took his wives of the daughters of Canaan; Adah thedaughter of Elon the Hittite, and Aholibamah the daughter of Anah thedaughter of Zibeon the Hivite; 

{36:3} And Bashemath Ishmael's daughter,sister of Nebajoth. 

{36:4} And Adah bare to Esau Eliphaz; and Bashemathbare Reuel; 

{36:5} And Aholibamah bare Jeush, and Jaalam, and Korah:these [are] the sons of Esau, which were born unto him in the land ofCanaan. 

{36:6} And Esau took his wives, and his sons, and hisdaughters, and all the persons of his house, and his cattle, and allhis beasts, and all his substance, which he had got in the land ofCanaan; and went into the country from the face of his brother Jacob.

{36:7} For their riches were more than that they might dwell together;and the land wherein they were strangers could not bear them because oftheir cattle. 

{36:8} Thus dwelt Esau in mount Seir: Esau [is] Edom.   

{36:9} And these [are] the generations of Esau the father of theEdomites in mount Seir: 

{36:10} These [are] the names of Esau's sons;Eliphaz the son of Adah the wife of Esau, Reuel the son of Bashemaththe wife of Esau. 

{36:11} And the sons of Eliphaz were Teman, Omar,Zepho, and Gatam, and Kenaz. 

{36:12} And Timna was concubine to EliphazEsau's son; and she bare to Eliphaz Amalek: these [were] the sons ofAdah Esau's wife. 

{36:13} And these [are] the sons of Reuel; Nahath,and Zerah, Shammah, and Mizzah: these were the sons of Bashemath Esau'swife.   

{36:14} And these were the sons of Aholibamah, the daughter of Anahthe daughter of Zibeon, Esau's wife: and she bare to Esau Jeush, andJaalam, and Korah.   

{36:15} These [were] dukes of the sons of Esau: the sons of Eliphazthe firstborn [son] of Esau; duke Teman, duke Omar, duke Zepho, dukeKenaz, 

{36:16} Duke Korah, duke Gatam, [and] duke Amalek: these [are]the dukes [that came] of Eliphaz in the land of Edom; these [were] thesons of Adah.

{36:19} These [are] thesons of Esau, who [is] Edom, and these [are] their dukes.   

{36:20} These [are] the sons of Seir the Horite, who inhabited theland; Lotan, and Shobal, and Zibeon, and Anah, 

{36:21} And Dishon, andEzer, and Dishan: these [are] the dukes of the Horites, the children ofSeir in the land of Edom. 

{36:22} And the children of Lotan were Horiand Hemam; and Lotan's sister [was] Timna. 

{36:23} And the children ofShobal [were] these; Alvan, and Manahath, and Ebal, Shepho, and Onam.

{36:24} And these [are] the children of Zibeon; both Ajah, and Anah:this [was that] Anah that found the mules in the wilderness, as he fedthe asses of Zibeon his father. 

{36:25} And the children of Anah [were]these; Dishon, and Aholibamah the daughter of Anah. 

{36:26} And these[are] the children of Dishon; Hemdan, and Eshban, and Ithran, andCheran. 

{36:27} The children of Ezer [are] these; Bilhan, and Zaavan,and Akan. 

{36:28} The children of Dishan [are] these: Uz, and Aran.

{36:29} These [are] the dukes [that came] of the Horites; duke Lotan,duke Shobal, duke Zibeon, duke Anah, 

{36:30} Duke Dishon, duke Ezer,duke Dishan: these [are] the dukes [that came] of Hori, among theirdukes in the land of Seir.   

{36:31} And these [are] the kings that reigned in the land of Edom,before there reigned any king over the children of Israel. 

{36:32} AndBela the son of Beor reigned in Edom: and the name of his city [was]Dinhabah. 

{36:33} And Bela died, and Jobab the son of Zerah of Bozrahreigned in his stead. 

{36:34} And Jobab died, and Husham of the land ofTemani reigned in his stead. 

{36:35} And Husham died, and Hadad the sonof Bedad, who smote Midian in the field of Moab, reigned in his stead:and the name of his city [was] Avith. 

{36:36} And Hadad died, andSamlah of Masrekah reigned in his stead. 

{36:37} And Samlah died, andSaul of Rehoboth [by] the river reigned in his stead. 

{36:38} And Sauldied, and Baal-hanan the son of Achbor reigned in his stead. 

{36:39}And Baal-hanan the son of Achbor died, and Hadar reigned in his stead:and the name of his city [was] Pau; and his wife's name [was]Mehetabel, the daughter of Matred, the daughter of Mezahab. 

{36:40} Andthese [are] the names of the dukes [that came] of Esau, according totheir families, after their places, by their names; duke Timnah, dukeAlvah, duke Jetheth, 

{36:41} Duke Aholibamah, duke Elah, duke Pinon,

{36:42} Duke Kenaz, duke Teman, duke Mibzar, 

{36:43} Duke Magdiel, dukeIram: these [be] the dukes of Edom, according to their habitations inthe land of their possession: he [is] Esau the father of the Edomites.   

{37:1} And Jacob dwelt in the land wherein his father was astranger, in the land of Canaan. 

{37:2} These [are] the generations ofJacob. Joseph, [being] seventeen years old, was feeding the flock withhis brethren; and the lad [was] with the sons of Bilhah, and with thesons of Zilpah, his father's wives: and Joseph brought unto his fathertheir evil report. 

{37:3} Now Israel loved Joseph more than all hischildren, because he [was] the son of his old age: and he made him acoat of [many] colours. 

{37:4} And when his brethren saw that theirfather loved him more than all his brethren, they hated him, and couldnot speak peaceably unto him.   

{37:5} And Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told [it] his brethren:and they hated him yet the more. 

{37:6} And he said unto them, Hear, Ipray you, this dream which I have dreamed: 

{37:7} For, behold, we[were] binding sheaves in the field, and, lo, my sheaf arose, and alsostood upright; and, behold, your sheaves stood round about, and madeobeisance to my sheaf. 

{37:8} And his brethren said to him, Shalt thouindeed reign over us? or shalt thou indeed have dominion over us? Andthey hated him yet the more for his dreams, and for his words.   

{37:9} And he dreamed yet another dream, and told it his brethren,and said, Behold, I have dreamed a dream more; and, behold, the sun andthe moon and the eleven stars made obeisance to me. 

{37:10} And he told[it] to his father, and to his brethren: and his father rebuked him,and said unto him, What [is] this dream that thou hast dreamed? Shall Iand thy mother and thy brethren indeed come to bow down ourselves tothee to the earth? 

{37:11} And his brethren envied him; but his fatherobserved the saying.   

{37:12} And his brethren went to feed their father's flock inShechem. 

{37:13} And Israel said unto Joseph, Do not thy brethren feed[the flock] in Shechem? come, and I will send thee unto them. And hesaid to him, Here [am] I. 

{37:14} And he said to him, Go, I pray thee,see whether it be well with thy brethren, and well with the flocks; andbring me word again. So he sent him out of the vale of Hebron, and hecame to Shechem.   

{37:15} And a certain man found him, and, behold, [he was] wanderingin the field: and the man asked him, saying, What seekest thou? 

{37:16}And he said, I seek my brethren: tell me, I pray thee, where they feed[their flocks. ]

{37:17} And the man said, They are departed hence; forI heard them say, Let us go to Dothan. And Joseph went after hisbrethren, and found them in Dothan. 

{37:18} And when they saw him afaroff, even before he came near unto them, they conspired against him toslay him. 

{37:19} And they said one to another, Behold, this dreamercometh. 

{37:20} Come now therefore, and let us slay him, and cast himinto some pit, and we will say, Some evil beast hath devoured him: andwe shall see what will become of his dreams. 

{37:21} And Reuben heard[it,] and he delivered him out of their hands; and said, Let us notkill him. 

{37:22} And Reuben said unto them, Shed no blood, [but] casthim into this pit that is in the wilderness, and lay no hand upon him;that he might rid him out of their hands, to deliver him to his fatheragain.   

{37:23} And it came to pass, when Joseph was come unto his brethren,that they stript Joseph out of his coat, [his] coat of [many] coloursthat [was] on him; 

{37:24} And they took him, and cast him into a pit:and the pit [was] empty, [there was] no water in it. 

{37:25} And theysat down to eat bread: and they lifted up their eyes and looked, and,behold, a company of Ishmeelites came from Gilead with their camelsbearing spicery and balm and myrrh, going to carry [it] down to Egypt.

{37:26} And Judah said unto his brethren, What profit [is it] if weslay our brother, and conceal his blood? 

{37:27} Come, and let us sellhim to the Ishmeelites, and let not our hand be upon him; for he [is]our brother [and] our flesh. And his brethren were content. 

{37:28}Then there passed by Midianites merchantmen; and they drew and liftedup Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the Ishmeelites for twenty[pieces] of silver: and they brought Joseph into Egypt.   

{37:29} And Reuben returned unto the pit; and, behold, Joseph [was]not in the pit; and he rent his clothes. 

{37:30} And he returned untohis brethren, and said, The child [is] not; and I, whither shall I go?

{37:31} And they took Joseph's coat, and killed a kid of the goats, anddipped the coat in the blood; 

{37:32} And they sent the coat of [many]colours, and they brought [it] to their father; and said, This have wefound: know now whether it [be] thy son's coat or no. 

{37:33} And heknew it, and said, [It is] my son's coat; an evil beast hath devouredhim; Joseph is without doubt rent in pieces. 

{37:34} And Jacob rent hisclothes, and put sackcloth upon his loins, and mourned for his son manydays. 

{37:35} And all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comforthim; but he refused to be comforted; and he said, For I will go downinto the grave unto my son mourning. Thus his father wept for him.

{37:36} And the Midianites sold him into Egypt unto Potiphar, anofficer of Pharaoh's, [and] captain of the guard.   

{38:1} And it came to pass at that time, that Judah went down fromhis brethren, and turned in to a certain Adullamite, whose name [was]Hirah. 

{38:2} And Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite,whose name [was] Shuah; and he took her, and went in unto her. 

{38:3}And she conceived, and bare a son; and he called his name Er. 

{38:4}And she conceived again, and bare a son; and she called his name Onan.

{38:5} And she yet again conceived, and bare a son; and called his nameShelah: and he was at Chezib, when she bare him. 

{38:6} And Judah tooka wife for Er his firstborn, whose name [was] Tamar. 

{38:7} And Er,Judah's firstborn, was wicked in the sight of the LORD; and the LORDslew him. 

{38:8} And Judah said unto Onan, Go in unto thy brother'swife, and marry her, and raise up seed to thy brother. 

{38:9} And Onanknew that the seed should not be his; and it came to pass, when he wentin unto his brother's wife, that he spilled [it] on the ground, lestthat he should give seed to his brother. 

{38:10} And the thing which hedid displeased the LORD: wherefore he slew him also. 

{38:11} Then saidJudah to Tamar his daughter in law, Remain a widow at thy father'shouse, till Shelah my son be grown: for he said, Lest peradventure hedie also, as his brethren [did.] And Tamar went and dwelt in herfather's house.   

{38:12} And in process of time the daughter of Shuah Judah's wifedied; and Judah was comforted, and went up unto his sheepshearers toTimnath, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite. 

{38:13} And it wastold Tamar, saying, Behold thy father in law goeth up to Timnath toshear his sheep. 

{38:14} And she put her widow's garments off from her,and covered her with a vail, and wrapped herself, and sat in an openplace, which [is] by the way to Timnath; for she saw that Shelah wasgrown, and she was not given unto him to wife. 

{38:15} When Judah sawher, he thought her [to be] an harlot; because she had covered herface. 

{38:16} And he turned unto her by the way, and said, Go to, Ipray thee, let me come in unto thee; (for he knew not that she [was]his daughter in law.) And she said, What wilt thou give me, that thoumayest come in unto me? 

{38:17} And he said, I will send [thee] a kidfrom the flock. And she said, Wilt thou give [me] a pledge, till thousend [it? ]

{38:18} And he said, What pledge shall I give thee? And shesaid, Thy signet, and thy bracelets, and thy staff that [is] in thinehand. And he gave [it] her, and came in unto her, and she conceived byhim. 

{38:19} And she arose, and went away, and laid by her vail fromher, and put on the garments of her widowhood. 

{38:20} And Judah sentthe kid by the hand of his friend the Adullamite, to receive [his]pledge from the woman's hand: but he found her not. 

{38:21} Then heasked the men of that place, saying, Where [is] the harlot, that [was]openly by the way side? And they said, There was no harlot in this[place. ]

{38:22} And he returned to Judah, and said, I cannot find her;and also the men of the place said, [that] there was no harlot in this[place. ]

{38:23} And Judah said, Let her take [it] to her, lest we beshamed: behold, I sent this kid, and thou hast not found her.   

{38:24} And it came to pass about three months after, that it wastold Judah, saying, Tamar thy daughter in law hath played the harlot;and also, behold, she [is] with child by whoredom. And Judah said,Bring her forth, and let her be burnt. 

{38:25} When she [was] broughtforth, she sent to her father in law, saying, By the man, whose these[are, am] I with child: and she said, Discern, I pray thee, whose [are]these, the signet, and bracelets, and staff. 

{38:26} And Judahacknowledged [them,] and said, She hath been more righteous than I;because that I gave her not to Shelah my son. And he knew her again nomore.   

{38:27} And it came to pass in the time of her travail, that,behold, twins [were] in her womb. 

{38:28} And it came to pass, when shetravailed, that [the one] put out [his] hand: and the midwife took andbound upon his hand a scarlet thread, saying, This came out first,

{38:29} And it came to pass, as he drew back his hand, that, behold,his brother came out: and she said, How hast thou broken forth? [this]breach [be] upon thee: therefore his name was called Pharez. 

{38:30}And afterward came out his brother, that had the scarlet thread uponhis hand: and his name was called Zarah.   

{39:1} And Joseph was brought down to Egypt; and Potiphar, anofficer of Pharaoh, captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him ofthe hands of the Ishmeelites, which had brought him down thither.

{39:2} And the LORD was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man; andhe was in the house of his master the Egyptian. 

{39:3} And his mastersaw that the LORD [was] with him, and that the LORD made all [that] hedid to prosper in his hand. 

{39:4} And Joseph found grace in his sight,and he served him: and he made him overseer over his house, and allthat he had he put into his hand. 

{39:5} And it came to pass from thetime [that] he had made him overseer in his house, and over all that hehad, that the LORD blessed the Egyptian's house for Joseph's sake; andthe blessing of the LORD was upon all that he had in the house, and inthe field. 

{39:6} And he left all that he had in Joseph's hand; and heknew not ought he had, save the bread which he did eat. And Joseph was[a] goodly [person,] and well favoured.   

{39:7} And it came to pass after these things, that his master'swife cast her eyes upon Joseph; and she said, Lie with me. 

{39:8} Buthe refused, and said unto his master's wife, Behold, my master wottethnot what [is] with me in the house, and he hath committed all that hehath to my hand; 

{39:9} [There is] none greater in this house than I;neither hath he kept back any thing from me but thee, because thou[art] his wife: how then can I do this great wickedness, and sinagainst God? 

{39:10} And it came to pass, as she spake to Joseph day byday, that he hearkened not unto her, to lie by her, [or] to be withher. 

{39:11} And it came to pass about this time, that [Joseph] wentinto the house to do his business; and [there was] none of the men ofthe house there within. 

{39:12} And she caught him by his garment,saying, Lie with me: and he left his garment in her hand, and fled, andgot him out. 

{39:13} And it came to pass, when she saw that he had lefthis garment in her hand, and was fled forth, 

{39:14} That she calledunto the men of her house, and spake unto them, saying, See, he hathbrought in an Hebrew unto us to mock us; he came in unto me to lie withme, and I cried with a loud voice: 

{39:15} And it came to pass, when heheard that I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garmentwith me, and fled, and got him out. 

{39:16} And she laid up his garmentby her, until his lord came home. 

{39:17} And she spake unto himaccording to these words, saying, The Hebrew servant, which thou hastbrought unto us, came in unto me to mock me: 

{39:18} And it came topass, as I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment withme, and fled out. 

{39:19} And it came to pass, when his master heardthe words of his wife, which she spake unto him, saying, After thismanner did thy servant to me; that his wrath was kindled. 

{39:20} AndJoseph's master took him, and put him into the prison, a place wherethe king's prisoners [were] bound: and he was there in the prison.   

{39:21} But the LORD was with Joseph, and shewed him mercy, and gavehim favour in the sight of the keeper of the prison. 

{39:22} And thekeeper of the prison committed to Joseph's hand all the prisoners that[were] in the prison; and whatsoever they did there, he was the doer[of it. ]

{39:23} The keeper of the prison looked not to any thing [thatwas] under his hand; because the LORD was with him, and [that] which hedid, the LORD made [it] to prosper.   

{40:1} And it came to pass after these things, [that] the butler ofthe king of Egypt and [his] baker had offended their lord the king ofEgypt. 

{40:2} And Pharaoh was wroth against two [of] his officers,against the chief of the butlers, and against the chief of the bakers.

{40:3} And he put them in ward in the house of the captain of theguard, into the prison, the place where Joseph [was] bound. 

{40:4} Andthe captain of the guard charged Joseph with them, and he served them:and they continued a season in ward.   

{40:5} And they dreamed a dream both of them, each man his dream inone night, each man according to the interpretation of his dream, thebutler and the baker of the king of Egypt, which [were] bound in theprison. 

{40:6} And Joseph came in unto them in the morning, and lookedupon them, and, behold, they [were] sad. 

{40:7} And he asked Pharaoh'sofficers that [were] with him in the ward of his lord's house, saying,Wherefore look ye [so] sadly to day? 

{40:8} And they said unto him, Wehave dreamed a dream, and [there is] no interpreter of it. And Josephsaid unto them, [Do] not interpretations [belong] to God? tell me[them,] I pray you. 

{40:9} And the chief butler told his dream toJoseph, and said to him, In my dream, behold, a vine [was] before me;

{40:10} And in the vine [were] three branches: and it [was] as thoughit budded, [and] her blossoms shot forth; and the clusters thereofbrought forth ripe grapes: 

{40:11} And Pharaoh's cup [was] in my hand:and I took the grapes, and pressed them into Pharaoh's cup, and I gavethe cup into Pharaoh's hand. 

{40:12} And Joseph said unto him, This[is] the interpretation of it: The three branches [are] three days:

{40:13} Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thine head, andrestore thee unto thy place: and thou shalt deliver Pharaoh's cup intohis hand, after the former manner when thou wast his butler. 

{40:14}But think on me when it shall be well with thee, and shew kindness, Ipray thee, unto me, and make mention of me unto Pharaoh, and bring meout of this house: 

{40:15} For indeed I was stolen away out of the landof the Hebrews: and here also have I done nothing that they should putme into the dungeon. 

{40:16} When the chief baker saw that theinterpretation was good, he said unto Joseph, I also [was] in my dream,and, behold, [I had] three white baskets on my head: 

{40:17} And in theuppermost basket [there was] of all manner of bakemeats for Pharaoh;and the birds did eat them out of the basket upon my head. 

{40:18} AndJoseph answered and said, This [is] the interpretation thereof: Thethree baskets [are] three days: 

{40:19} Yet within three days shallPharaoh lift up thy head from off thee, and shall hang thee on a tree;and the birds shall eat thy flesh from off thee.   

{40:20} And it came to pass the third day, [which was] Pharaoh'sbirthday, that he made a feast unto all his servants: and he lifted upthe head of the chief butler and of the chief baker among his servants.

{40:21} And he restored the chief butler unto his butlership again; andhe gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand: 

{40:22} But he hanged the chiefbaker: as Joseph had interpreted to them. 

{40:23} Yet did not the chiefbutler remember Joseph, but forgat him.   

{41:1} And it came to pass at the end of two full years, thatPharaoh dreamed: and, behold, he stood by the river. 

{41:2} And,behold, there came up out of the river seven well favoured kine andfatfleshed; and they fed in a meadow. 

{41:3} And, behold, seven otherkine came up after them out of the river, ill favoured and leanfleshed;and stood by the [other] kine upon the brink of the river. 

{41:4} Andthe ill favoured and leanfleshed kine did eat up the seven wellfavoured and fat kine. So Pharaoh awoke. 

{41:5} And he slept anddreamed the second time: and, behold, seven ears of corn came up uponone stalk, rank and good. 

{41:6} And, behold, seven thin ears andblasted with the east wind sprung up after them. 

{41:7} And the seventhin ears devoured the seven rank and full ears. And Pharaoh awoke,and, behold, [it was] a dream. 

{41:8} And it came to pass in themorning that his spirit was troubled; and he sent and called for allthe magicians of Egypt, and all the wise men thereof: and Pharaoh toldthem his dream; but [there was] none that could interpret them untoPharaoh.   

{41:9} Then spake the chief butler unto Pharaoh, saying, I doremember my faults this day: 

{41:10} Pharaoh was wroth with hisservants, and put me in ward in the captain of the guard's house, both[me] and the chief baker: 

{41:11} And we dreamed a dream in one night,I and he; we dreamed each man according to the interpretation of hisdream. 

{41:12} And [there was] there with us a young man, an Hebrew,servant to the captain of the guard; and we told him, and heinterpreted to us our dreams; to each man according to his dream he didinterpret. 

{41:13} And it came to pass, as he interpreted to us, so itwas; me he restored unto mine office, and him he hanged.   

{41:14} Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought himhastily out of the dungeon: and he shaved [himself,] and changed hisraiment, and came in unto Pharaoh. 

{41:15} And Pharaoh said untoJoseph, I have dreamed a dream, and [there is] none that can interpretit: and I have heard say of thee, [that] thou canst understand a dreamto interpret it. 

{41:16} And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, [It is]not in me: God shall give Pharaoh an answer of peace. 

{41:17} AndPharaoh said unto Joseph, In my dream, behold, I stood upon the bank ofthe river: 

{41:18} And, behold, there came up out of the river sevenkine, fatfleshed and well favoured; and they fed in a meadow: 

{41:19}And, behold, seven other kine came up after them, poor and very illfavoured and leanfleshed, such as I never saw in all the land of Egyptfor badness: 

{41:20} And the lean and the ill favoured kine did eat upthe first seven fat kine: 

{41:21} And when they had eaten them up, itcould not be known that they had eaten them; but they [were] still illfavoured, as at the beginning. So I awoke. 

{41:22} And I saw in mydream, and, behold, seven ears came up in one stalk, full and good:

{41:23} And, behold, seven ears, withered, thin, [and] blasted with theeast wind, sprung up after them: 

{41:24} And the thin ears devoured theseven good ears: and I told [this] unto the magicians; but [there was]none that could declare [it] to me.   

{41:25} And Joseph said unto Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh [is] one:God hath shewed Pharaoh what he [is] about to do. 

{41:26} The sevengood kine [are] seven years; and the seven good ears [are] seven years:the dream [is] one. 

{41:27} And the seven thin and ill favoured kinethat came up after them [are] seven years; and the seven empty earsblasted with the east wind shall be seven years of famine. 

{41:28} This[is] the thing which I have spoken unto Pharaoh: What God [is] about todo he sheweth unto Pharaoh. 

{41:29} Behold, there come seven years ofgreat plenty throughout all the land of Egypt: 

{41:30} And there shallarise after them seven years of famine; and all the plenty shall beforgotten in the land of Egypt; and the famine shall consume the land;

{41:31} And the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of thatfamine following; for it [shall be] very grievous. 

{41:32} And for thatthe dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice; [it is] because the thing[is] established by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass. 

{41:33}Now therefore let Pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise, and set himover the land of Egypt. 

{41:34} Let Pharaoh do [this,] and let himappoint officers over the land, and take up the fifth part of the landof Egypt in the seven plenteous years. 

{41:35} And let them gather allthe food of those good years that come, and lay up corn under the handof Pharaoh, and let them keep food in the cities. 

{41:36} And that foodshall be for store to the land against the seven years of famine, whichshall be in the land of Egypt; that the land perish not through thefamine.   

{41:37} And the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in theeyes of all his servants. 

{41:38} And Pharaoh said unto his servants,Can we find [such a one] as this [is,] a man in whom the Spirit of Godis? 

{41:39} And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Forasmuch as God hath shewedthee all this, [there is] none so discreet and wise as thou [art:]

{41:40} Thou shalt be over my house, and according unto thy word shallall my people be ruled: only in the throne will I be greater than thou.

{41:41} And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, See, I have set thee over all theland of Egypt. 

{41:42} And Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand, andput it upon Joseph's hand, and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen,and put a gold chain about his neck; 

{41:43} And he made him to ride inthe second chariot which he had; and they cried before him, Bow theknee: and he made him [ruler] over all the land of Egypt. 

{41:44} AndPharaoh said unto Joseph, I [am] Pharaoh, and without thee shall no manlift up his hand or foot in all the land of Egypt. 

{41:45} And Pharaohcalled Joseph's name Zaphnath-paaneah; and he gave him to wife Asenaththe daughter of Poti- pherah priest of On. And Joseph went out over[all] the land of Egypt.   

{41:46} And Joseph [was] thirty years old when he stood beforePharaoh king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence ofPharaoh, and went throughout all the land of Egypt. 

{41:47} And in theseven plenteous years the earth brought forth by handfuls. 

{41:48} Andhe gathered up all the food of the seven years, which were in the landof Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities: the food of the field,which [was] round about every city, laid he up in the same. 

{41:49} AndJoseph gathered corn as the sand of the sea, very much, until he leftnumbering; for [it was] without number. 

{41:50} And unto Joseph wereborn two sons before the years of famine came, which Asenath thedaughter of Poti- pherah priest of On bare unto him. 

{41:51} And Josephcalled the name of the firstborn Manasseh: For God, [said he,] hathmade me forget all my toil, and all my father's house. 

{41:52} And thename of the second called he Ephraim: For God hath caused me to befruitful in the land of my affliction.   

{41:53} And the seven years of plenteousness, that was in the landof Egypt, were ended. 

{41:54} And the seven years of dearth began tocome, according as Joseph had said: and the dearth was in all lands;but in all the land of Egypt there was bread. 

{41:55} And when all theland of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread: andPharaoh said unto all the Egyptians, Go unto Joseph; what he saith toyou, do. 

{41:56} And the famine was over all the face of the earth: andJoseph opened all the storehouses, and sold unto the Egyptians; and thefamine waxed sore in the land of Egypt. 

{41:57} And all countries cameinto Egypt to Joseph for to buy [corn;] because that the famine was sosore in all lands.   

{42:1} Now when Jacob saw that there was corn in Egypt, Jacob saidunto his sons, Why do ye look one upon another? 

{42:2} And he said,Behold, I have heard that there is corn in Egypt: get you down thither,and buy for us from thence; that we may live, and not die.   

{42:3} And Joseph's ten brethren went down to buy corn in Egypt.

{42:4} But Benjamin, Joseph's brother, Jacob sent not with hisbrethren; for he said, Lest peradventure mischief befall him. 

{42:5}And the sons of Israel came to buy [corn] among those that came: forthe famine was in the land of Canaan. 

{42:6} And Joseph [was] thegovernor over the land, [and] he [it was] that sold to all the peopleof the land: and Joseph's brethren came, and bowed down themselvesbefore him [with] their faces to the earth. 

{42:7} And Joseph saw hisbrethren, and he knew them, but made himself strange unto them, andspake roughly unto them; and he said unto them, Whence come ye? Andthey said, From the land of Canaan to buy food. 

{42:8} And Joseph knewhis brethren, but they knew not him. 

{42:9} And Joseph remembered thedreams which he dreamed of them, and said unto them, Ye [are] spies; tosee the nakedness of the land ye are come. 

{42:10} And they said untohim, Nay, my lord, but to buy food are thy servants come. 

{42:11} We[are] all one man's sons; we [are] true [men,] thy servants are nospies. 

{42:12} And he said unto them, Nay, but to see the nakedness ofthe land ye are come. 

{42:13} And they said, Thy servants [are] twelvebrethren, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan; and, behold, theyoungest [is] this day with our father, and one [is] not. 

{42:14} AndJoseph said unto them, That [is it] that I spake unto you, saying, Ye[are] spies: 

{42:15} Hereby ye shall be proved: By the life of Pharaohye shall not go forth hence, except your youngest brother come hither.

{42:16} Send one of you, and let him fetch your brother, and ye shallbe kept in prison, that your words may be proved, whether [there beany] truth in you: or else by the life of Pharaoh surely ye [are]spies. 

{42:17} And he put them all together into ward three days.

{42:18} And Joseph said unto them the third day, This do, and live;[for] I fear God: 

{42:19} If ye [be] true [men,] let one of yourbrethren be bound in the house of your prison: go ye, carry corn forthe famine of your houses: 

{42:20} But bring your youngest brother untome; so shall your words be verified, and ye shall not die. And they didso.   

{42:21} And they said one to another, We [are] verily guiltyconcerning our brother, in that we saw the anguish of his soul, when hebesought us, and we would not hear; therefore is this distress comeupon us. 

{42:22} And Reuben answered them, saying, Spake I not untoyou, saying, Do not sin against the child; and ye would not hear?therefore, behold, also his blood is required. 

{42:23} And they knewnot that Joseph understood [them;] for he spake unto them by aninterpreter. 

{42:24} And he turned himself about from them, and wept;and returned to them again, and communed with them, and took from themSimeon, and bound him before their eyes.   

{42:25} Then Joseph commanded to fill their sacks with corn, and torestore every man's money into his sack, and to give them provision forthe way: and thus did he unto them. 

{42:26} And they laded their asseswith the corn, and departed thence. 

{42:27} And as one of them openedhis sack to give his ass provender in the inn, he espied his money;for, behold, it [was] in his sack's mouth. 

{42:28} And he said unto hisbrethren, My money is restored; and, lo, [it is] even in my sack: andtheir heart failed [them,] and they were afraid, saying one to another,What [is] this [that] God hath done unto us?   

{42:29} And they came unto Jacob their father unto the land ofCanaan, and told him all that befell unto them; saying, 

{42:30} Theman, [who is] the lord of the land, spake roughly to us, and took usfor spies of the country. 

{42:31} And we said unto him, We [are] true[men;] we are no spies: 

{42:32} We [be] twelve brethren, sons of ourfather; one [is] not, and the youngest [is] this day with our father inthe land of Canaan. 

{42:33} And the man, the lord of the country, saidunto us, Hereby shall I know that ye [are] true [men;] leave one ofyour brethren [here] with me, and take [food for] the famine of yourhouseholds, and be gone: 

{42:34} And bring your youngest brother untome: then shall I know that ye [are] no spies, but [that] ye [are] true[men: so] will I deliver you your brother, and ye shall traffick in theland.   

{42:35} And it came to pass as they emptied their sacks, that,behold, every man's bundle of money [was] in his sack: and when [both]they and their father saw the bundles of money, they were afraid.

{42:36} And Jacob their father said unto them, Me have ye bereaved [ofmy children:] Joseph [is] not, and Simeon [is] not, and ye will takeBenjamin [away:] all these things are against me. 

{42:37} And Reubenspake unto his father, saying, Slay my two sons, if I bring him not tothee: deliver him into my hand, and I will bring him to thee again.

{42:38} And he said, My son shall not go down with you; for his brotheris dead, and he is left alone: if mischief befall him by the way in thewhich ye go, then shall ye bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to thegrave.   

{43:1} And the famine [was] sore in the land. 

{43:2} And it came topass, when they had eaten up the corn which they had brought out ofEgypt, their father said unto them, Go again, buy us a little food.

{43:3} And Judah spake unto him, saying, The man did solemnly protestunto us, saying, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother [be]with you. 

{43:4} If thou wilt send our brother with us, we will go downand buy thee food: 

{43:5} But if thou wilt not send [him,] we will notgo down: for the man said unto us, Ye shall not see my face, exceptyour brother [be] with you. 

{43:6} And Israel said, Wherefore dealt yeso ill with me, as to tell the man whether ye had yet a brother? 

{43:7}And they said, The man asked us straitly of our state, and of ourkindred, saying, [Is] your father yet alive? have ye [another] brother?and we told him according to the tenor of these words: could wecertainly know that he would say, Bring your brother down? 

{43:8} AndJudah said unto Israel his father, Send the lad with me, and we willarise and go; that we may live, and not die, both we, and thou, [and]also our little ones. 

{43:9} I will be surety for him; of my hand shaltthou require him: if I bring him not unto thee, and set him beforethee, then let me bear the blame for ever: 

{43:10} For except we hadlingered, surely now we had returned this second time. 

{43:11} Andtheir father Israel said unto them, If [it must be] so now, do this;take of the best fruits in the land in your vessels, and carry down theman a present, a little balm, and a little honey, spices, and myrrh,nuts, and almonds: 

{43:12} And take double money in your hand; and themoney that was brought again in the mouth of your sacks, carry [it]again in your hand; peradventure it [was] an oversight: 

{43:13} Takealso your brother, and arise, go again unto the man: 

{43:14} And GodAlmighty give you mercy before the man, that he may send away yourother brother, and Benjamin. If I be bereaved [of my children,] I ambereaved.   

{43:15} And the men took that present, and they took double money intheir hand, and Benjamin; and rose up, and went down to Egypt, andstood before Joseph. 

{43:16} And when Joseph saw Benjamin with them, hesaid to the ruler of his house, Bring [these] men home, and slay, andmake ready; for [these] men shall dine with me at noon. 

{43:17} And theman did as Joseph bade; and the man brought the men into Joseph'shouse. 

{43:18} And the men were afraid, because they were brought intoJoseph's house; and they said, Because of the money that was returnedin our sacks at the first time are we brought in; that he may seekoccasion against us, and fall upon us, and take us for bondmen, and ourasses. 

{43:19} And they came near to the steward of Joseph's house, andthey communed with him at the door of the house, 

{43:20} And said, Osir, we came indeed down at the first time to buy food: 

{43:21} And itcame to pass, when we came to the inn, that we opened our sacks, and,behold, [every] man's money [was] in the mouth of his sack, our moneyin full weight: and we have brought it again in our hand. 

{43:22} Andother money have we brought down in our hands to buy food: we cannottell who put our money in our sacks. 

{43:23} And he said, Peace [be] toyou, fear not: your God, and the God of your father, hath given youtreasure in your sacks: I had your money. And he brought Simeon outunto them. 

{43:24} And the man brought the men into Joseph's house, andgave [them] water, and they washed their feet; and he gave their assesprovender. 

{43:25} And they made ready the present against Joseph cameat noon: for they heard that they should eat bread there.   

{43:26} And when Joseph came home, they brought him the presentwhich [was] in their hand into the house, and bowed themselves to himto the earth. 

{43:27} And he asked them of [their] welfare, and said,[Is] your father well, the old man of whom ye spake? [Is] he yet alive?

{43:28} And they answered, Thy servant our father [is] in good health,he [is] yet alive. And they bowed down their heads, and made obeisance.

{43:29} And he lifted up his eyes, and saw his brother Benjamin, hismother's son, and said, [Is] this your younger brother, of whom yespake unto me? And he said, God be gracious unto thee, my son. 

{43:30}And Joseph made haste; for his bowels did yearn upon his brother: andhe sought [where] to weep; and he entered into [his] chamber, and weptthere. 

{43:31} And he washed his face, and went out, and refrainedhimself, and said, Set on bread. 

{43:32} And they set on for him byhimself, and for them by themselves, and for the Egyptians, which dideat with him, by themselves: because the Egyptians might not eat breadwith the Hebrews; for that [is] an abomination unto the Egyptians.

{43:33} And they sat before him, the firstborn according to hisbirthright, and the youngest according to his youth: and the menmarvelled one at another. 

{43:34} And he took [and sent] messes untothem from before him: but Benjamin's mess was five times so much as anyof theirs. And they drank, and were merry with him.   

{44:1} And he commanded the steward of his house, saying, Fill themen's sacks [with] food, as much as they can carry, and put every man'smoney in his sack's mouth. 

{44:2} And put my cup, the silver cup, inthe sack's mouth of the youngest, and his corn money. And he didaccording to the word that Joseph had spoken. 

{44:3} As soon as themorning was light, the men were sent away, they and their asses. 

{44:4}[And] when they were gone out of the city, [and] not [yet] far off,Joseph said unto his steward, Up, follow after the men; and when thoudost overtake them, say unto them, Wherefore have ye rewarded evil forgood? 

{44:5} [Is] not this [it] in which my lord drinketh, and wherebyindeed he divineth? ye have done evil in so doing.   

{44:6} And he overtook them, and he spake unto them these samewords. 

{44:7} And they said unto him, Wherefore saith my lord thesewords? God forbid that thy servants should do according to this thing:

{44:8} Behold, the money, which we found in our sacks' mouths, webrought again unto thee out of the land of Canaan: how then should westeal out of thy lord's house silver or gold? 

{44:9} With whomsoever ofthy servants it be found, both let him die, and we also will be mylord's bondmen. 

{44:10} And he said, Now also [let] it [be] accordingunto your words; he with whom it is found shall be my servant; and yeshall be blameless. 

{44:11} Then they speedily took down every man hissack to the ground, and opened every man his sack. 

{44:12} And hesearched, [and] began at the eldest, and left at the youngest: and thecup was found in Benjamin's sack. 

{44:13} Then they rent their clothes,and laded every man his ass, and returned to the city.   

{44:14} And Judah and his brethren came to Joseph's house; for he[was] yet there: and they fell before him on the ground. 

{44:15} AndJoseph said unto them, What deed [is] this that ye have done? wot yenot that such a man as I can certainly divine? 

{44:16} And Judah said,What shall we say unto my lord? what shall we speak? or how shall weclear ourselves? God hath found out the iniquity of thy servants:behold, we [are] my lord's servants, both we, and [he] also with whomthe cup is found. 

{44:17} And he said, God forbid that I should do so:[but] the man in whose hand the cup is found, he shall be my servant;and as for you, get you up in peace unto your father.   

{44:18} Then Judah came near unto him, and said, Oh my lord, let thyservant, I pray thee, speak a word in my lord's ears, and let not thineanger burn against thy servant: for thou [art] even as Pharaoh. 

{44:19}My lord asked his servants, saying, Have ye a father, or a brother?

{44:20} And we said unto my lord, We have a father, an old man, and achild of his old age, a little one; and his brother is dead, and healone is left of his mother, and his father loveth him. 

{44:21} Andthou saidst unto thy servants, Bring him down unto me, that I may setmine eyes upon him. 

{44:22} And we said unto my lord, The lad cannotleave his father: for [if] he should leave his father, [his father]would die. 

{44:23} And thou saidst unto thy servants, Except youryoungest brother come down with you, ye shall see my face no more.

{44:24} And it came to pass when we came up unto thy servant my father,we told him the words of my lord. 

{44:25} And our father said, Goagain, [and] buy us a little food. 

{44:26} And we said, We cannot godown: if our youngest brother be with us, then will we go down: for wemay not see the man's face, except our youngest brother [be] with us.

{44:27} And thy servant my father said unto us, Ye know that my wifebare me two [sons: ]

{44:28} And the one went out from me, and I said,Surely he is torn in pieces; and I saw him not since: 

{44:29} And if yetake this also from me, and mischief befall him, ye shall bring down mygray hairs with sorrow to the grave. 

{44:30} Now therefore when I cometo thy servant my father, and the lad [be] not with us; seeing that hislife is bound up in the lad's life; 

{44:31} It shall come to pass, whenhe seeth that the lad [is] not [with us,] that he will die: and thyservants shall bring down the gray hairs of thy servant our father withsorrow to the grave. 

{44:32} For thy servant became surety for the ladunto my father, saying, If I bring him not unto thee, then I shall bearthe blame to my father for ever. 

{44:33} Now therefore, I pray thee,let thy servant abide instead of the lad a bondman to my lord; and letthe lad go up with his brethren. 

{44:34} For how shall I go up to myfather, and the lad [be] not with me? lest peradventure I see the evilthat shall come on my father.   

{45:1} Then Joseph could not refrain himself before all them thatstood by him; and he cried, Cause every man to go out from me. Andthere stood no man with him, while Joseph made himself known unto hisbrethren. 

{45:2} And he wept aloud: and the Egyptians and the house ofPharaoh heard. 

{45:3} And Joseph said unto his brethren, I [am] Joseph;doth my father yet live? And his brethren could not answer him; forthey were troubled at his presence. 

{45:4} And Joseph said unto hisbrethren, Come near to me, I pray you. And they came near. And he said,I [am] Joseph your brother, whom ye sold into Egypt. 

{45:5} Nowtherefore be not grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that ye sold mehither: for God did send me before you to preserve life. 

{45:6} Forthese two years [hath] the famine [been] in the land: and yet [thereare] five years, in the which [there shall] neither [be] earing norharvest. 

{45:7} And God sent me before you to preserve you a posterityin the earth, and to save your lives by a great deliverance. 

{45:8} Sonow [it was] not you [that] sent me hither, but God: and he hath mademe a father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house, and a rulerthroughout all the land of Egypt. 

{45:9} Haste ye, and go up to myfather, and say unto him, Thus saith thy son Joseph, God hath made melord of all Egypt: come down unto me, tarry not: 

{45:10} And thou shaltdwell in the land of Goshen, and thou shalt be near unto me, thou, andthy children, and thy children's children, and thy flocks, and thyherds, and all that thou hast: 

{45:11} And there will I nourish thee;for yet [there are] five years of famine; lest thou, and thy household,and all that thou hast, come to poverty. 

{45:12} And, behold, your eyessee, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin, that [it is] my mouth thatspeaketh unto you. 

{45:13} And ye shall tell my father of all my gloryin Egypt, and of all that ye have seen; and ye shall haste and bringdown my father hither. 

{45:14} And he fell upon his brother Benjamin'sneck, and wept; and Benjamin wept upon his neck. 

{45:15} Moreover hekissed all his brethren, and wept upon them: and after that hisbrethren talked with him.   

{45:16} And the fame thereof was heard in Pharaoh's house, saying,Joseph's brethren are come: and it pleased Pharaoh well, and hisservants. 

{45:17} And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Say unto thy brethren,This do ye; lade your beasts, and go, get you unto the land of Canaan;

{45:18} And take your father and your households, and come unto me: andI will give you the good of the land of Egypt, and ye shall eat the fatof the land. 

{45:19} Now thou art commanded, this do ye; take youwagons out of the land of Egypt for your little ones, and for yourwives, and bring your father, and come. 

{45:20} Also regard not yourstuff; for the good of all the land of Egypt [is] yours. 

{45:21} Andthe children of Israel did so: and Joseph gave them wagons, accordingto the commandment of Pharaoh, and gave them provision for the way.

{45:22} To all of them he gave each man changes of raiment; but toBenjamin he gave three hundred [pieces] of silver, and five changes ofraiment. 

{45:23} And to his father he sent after this [manner;] tenasses laden with the good things of Egypt, and ten she asses laden withcorn and bread and meat for his father by the way. 

{45:24} So he senthis brethren away, and they departed: and he said unto them, See thatye fall not out by the way.   

{45:25} And they went up out of Egypt, and came into the land ofCanaan unto Jacob their father, 

{45:26} And told him, saying, Joseph[is] yet alive, and he [is] governor over all the land of Egypt. AndJacob's heart fainted, for he believed them not. 

{45:27} And they toldhim all the words of Joseph, which he had said unto them: and when hesaw the wagons which Joseph had sent to carry him, the spirit of Jacobtheir father revived: 

{45:28} And Israel said, [It is] enough; Josephmy son [is] yet alive: I will go and see him before I die.   

{46:1} And Israel took his journey with all that he had, and came toBeer-sheba, and offered sacrifices unto the God of his father Isaac.

{46:2} And God spake unto Israel in the visions of the night, and said,Jacob, Jacob. And he said, Here [am] I. 

{46:3} And he said, I [am] God,the God of thy father: fear not to go down into Egypt; for I will theremake of thee a great nation: 

{46:4} I will go down with thee intoEgypt; and I will also surely bring thee up [again:] and Joseph shallput his hand upon thine eyes. 

{46:5} And Jacob rose up from Beer-sheba:and the sons of Israel carried Jacob their father, and their littleones, and their wives, in the wagons which Pharaoh had sent to carryhim. 

{46:6} And they took their cattle, and their goods, which they hadgotten in the land of Canaan, and came into Egypt, Jacob, and all hisseed with him: 

{46:7} His sons, and his sons' sons with him, hisdaughters, and his sons' daughters, and all his seed brought he withhim into Egypt.   

{46:8} And these [are] the names of the children of Israel, whichcame into Egypt, Jacob and his sons: Reuben, Jacob's firstborn. 

{46:9}And the sons of Reuben; Hanoch, and Phallu, and Hezron, and Carmi.   

{46:10} And the sons of Simeon; Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, andJachin, and Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman.   

{46:11} And the sons of Levi; Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.   

{46:12} And the sons of Judah; Er, and Onan, and Shelah, and Pharez,and Zarah: but Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan. And the sons ofPharez were Hezron and Hamul.   

{46:13} And the sons of Issachar; Tola, and Phuvah, and Job, andShimron.   

{46:14} And the sons of Zebulun; Sered, and Elon, and Jahleel.

{46:15} These [be] the sons of Leah, which she bare unto Jacob inPadan-aram, with his daughter Dinah: all the souls of his sons and hisdaughters [were] thirty and three.   

{46:16} And the sons of Gad; Ziphion, and Haggi, Shuni, and Ezbon,Eri, and Arodi, and Areli.   

{46:17} And the sons of Asher; Jimnah, and Ishuah, and Isui, andBeriah, and Serah their sister: and the sons of Beriah; Heber, andMalchiel. 

{46:18} These [are] the sons of Zilpah, whom Laban gave toLeah his daughter, and these she bare unto Jacob, [even] sixteen souls.

{46:19} The sons of Rachel Jacob's wife; Joseph, and Benjamin.   

{46:20} And unto Joseph in the land of Egypt were born Manasseh andEphraim, which Asenath the daughter of Poti-pherah priest of On bareunto him.   

{46:21} And the sons of Benjamin were Belah, and Becher, and Ashbel,Gera, and Naaman, Ehi, and Rosh, Muppim, and Huppim, and Ard. 

{46:22}These [are] the sons of Rachel, which were born to Jacob: all the souls[were] fourteen.   

{46:23} And the sons of Dan; Hushim.   

{46:24} And the sons of Naphtali; Jahzeel, and Guni, and Jezer, andShillem. 

{46:25} These [are] the sons of Bilhah, which Laban gave untoRachel his daughter, and she bare these unto Jacob: all the souls[were] seven. 

{46:26} All the souls that came with Jacob into Egypt,which came out of his loins, besides Jacob's sons' wives, all the souls[were] threescore and six; 

{46:27} And the sons of Joseph, which wereborn him in Egypt, [were] two souls: all the souls of the house ofJacob, which came into Egypt, [were] threescore and ten.   

{46:28} And he sent Judah before him unto Joseph, to direct his faceunto Goshen; and they came into the land of Goshen. 

{46:29} And Josephmade ready his chariot, and went up to meet Israel his father, toGoshen, and presented himself unto him; and he fell on his neck, andwept on his neck a good while. 

{46:30} And Israel said unto Joseph, Nowlet me die, since I have seen thy face, because thou [art] yet alive.

{46:31} And Joseph said unto his brethren, and unto his father's house,I will go up, and shew Pharaoh, and say unto him, My brethren, and myfather's house, which [were] in the land of Canaan, are come unto me;

{46:32} And the men [are] shepherds, for their trade hath been to feedcattle; and they have brought their flocks, and their herds, and allthat they have. 

{46:33} And it shall come to pass, when Pharaoh shallcall you, and shall say, What [is] your occupation? 

{46:34} That yeshall say, Thy servants' trade hath been about cattle from our youtheven until now, both we, [and] also our fathers: that ye may dwell inthe land of Goshen; for every shepherd [is] an abomination unto theEgyptians.   

{47:1} Then Joseph came and told Pharaoh, and said, My father and mybrethren, and their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have,are come out of the land of Canaan; and, behold, they [are] in the landof Goshen. 

{47:2} And he took some of his brethren, [even] five men,and presented them unto Pharaoh. 

{47:3} And Pharaoh said unto hisbrethren, What [is] your occupation? And they said unto Pharaoh, Thyservants [are] shepherds, both we, [and] also our fathers. 

{47:4} Theysaid moreover unto Pharaoh, For to sojourn in the land are we come; forthy servants have no pasture for their flocks; for the famine [is] sorein the land of Canaan: now therefore, we pray thee, let thy servantsdwell in the land of Goshen. 

{47:5} And Pharaoh spake unto Joseph,saying, Thy father and thy brethren are come unto thee: 

{47:6} The landof Egypt [is] before thee; in the best of the land make thy father andbrethren to dwell; in the land of Goshen let them dwell: and if thouknowest [any] men of activity among them, then make them rulers over mycattle. 

{47:7} And Joseph brought in Jacob his father, and set himbefore Pharaoh: and Jacob blessed Pharaoh. 

{47:8} And Pharaoh said untoJacob, How old [art] thou? 

{47:9} And Jacob said unto Pharaoh, The daysof the years of my pilgrimage [are] an hundred and thirty years: fewand evil have the days of the years of my life been, and have notattained unto the days of the years of the life of my fathers in thedays of their pilgrimage. 

{47:10} And Jacob blessed Pharaoh, and wentout from before Pharaoh.   

{47:11} And Joseph placed his father and his brethren, and gave thema possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the landof Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded. 

{47:12} And Joseph nourished hisfather, and his brethren, and all his father's household, with bread,according to [their] families.   

{47:13} And [there was] no bread in all the land; for the famine[was] very sore, so that the land of Egypt and [all] the land of Canaanfainted by reason of the famine. 

{47:14} And Joseph gathered up all themoney that was found in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan,for the corn which they bought: and Joseph brought the money intoPharaoh's house. 

{47:15} And when money failed in the land of Egypt,and in the land of Canaan, all the Egyptians came unto Joseph, andsaid, Give us bread: for why should we die in thy presence? for themoney faileth. 

{47:16} And Joseph said, Give your cattle; and I willgive you for your cattle, if money fail. 

{47:17} And they brought theircattle unto Joseph: and Joseph gave them bread [in exchange] forhorses, and for the flocks, and for the cattle of the herds, and forthe asses: and he fed them with bread for all their cattle for thatyear. 

{47:18} When that year was ended, they came unto him the secondyear, and said unto him, We will not hide [it] from my lord, how thatour money is spent; my lord also hath our herds of cattle; there is notought left in the sight of my lord, but our bodies, and our lands:

{47:19} Wherefore shall we die before thine eyes, both we and our land?buy us and our land for bread, and we and our land will be servantsunto Pharaoh: and give [us] seed, that we may live, and not die, thatthe land be not desolate. 

{47:20} And Joseph bought all the land ofEgypt for Pharaoh; for the Egyptians sold every man his field, becausethe famine prevailed over them: so the land became Pharaoh's. 

{47:21}And as for the people, he removed them to cities from [one] end of theborders of Egypt even to the [other] end thereof. 

{47:22} Only the landof the priests bought he not; for the priests had a portion [assignedthem] of Pharaoh, and did eat their portion which Pharaoh gave them:wherefore they sold not their lands. 

{47:23} Then Joseph said unto thepeople, Behold, I have bought you this day and your land for Pharaoh:lo, [here is] seed for you, and ye shall sow the land. 

{47:24} And itshall come to pass in the increase, that ye shall give the fifth [part]unto Pharaoh, and four parts shall be your own, for seed of the field,and for your food, and for them of your households, and for food foryour little ones. 

{47:25} And they said, Thou hast saved our lives: letus find grace in the sight of my lord, and we will be Pharaoh'sservants. 

{47:26} And Joseph made it a law over the land of Egypt untothis day, [that] Pharaoh should have the fifth [part;] except the landof the priests only, [which] became not Pharaoh's.   

{47:27} And Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt, in the country ofGoshen; and they had possessions therein, and grew, and multipliedexceedingly. 

{47:28} And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeenyears: so the whole age of Jacob was an hundred forty and seven years.

{47:29} And the time drew nigh that Israel must die: and he called hisson Joseph, and said unto him, If now I have found grace in thy sight,put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh, and deal kindly and trulywith me; bury me not, I pray thee, in Egypt: 

{47:30} But I will liewith my fathers, and thou shalt carry me out of Egypt, and bury me intheir buryingplace. And he said, I will do as thou hast said. 

{47:31}And he said, Swear unto me. And he sware unto him. And Israel bowedhimself upon the bed's head.   

{48:1} And it came to pass after these things, that [one] toldJoseph, Behold, thy father [is] sick: and he took with him his twosons, Manasseh and Ephraim. 

{48:2} And [one] told Jacob, and said,Behold, thy son Joseph cometh unto thee: and Israel strengthenedhimself, and sat upon the bed. 

{48:3} And Jacob said unto Joseph, GodAlmighty appeared unto me at Luz in the land of Canaan, and blessed me,

{48:4} And said unto me, Behold, I will make thee fruitful, andmultiply thee, and I will make of thee a multitude of people; and willgive this land to thy seed after thee [for] an everlasting possession.   

{48:5} And now thy two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, which were bornunto thee in the land of Egypt before I came unto thee into Egypt,[are] mine; as Reuben and Simeon, they shall be mine. 

{48:6} And thyissue, which thou begettest after them, shall be thine, [and] shall becalled after the name of their brethren in their inheritance. 

{48:7}And as for me, when I came from Padan, Rachel died by me in the land ofCanaan in the way, when yet [there was] but a little way to come untoEphrath: and I buried her there in the way of Ephrath; the same isBethlehem. 

{48:8} And Israel beheld Joseph's sons, and said, Who [are]these? 

{48:9} And Joseph said unto his father, They [are] my sons, whomGod hath given me in this [place.] And he said, Bring them, I praythee, unto me, and I will bless them. 

{48:10} Now the eyes of Israelwere dim for age, [so that] he could not see. And he brought them nearunto him; and he kissed them, and embraced them. 

{48:11} And Israelsaid unto Joseph, I had not thought to see thy face: and, lo, God hathshewed me also thy seed. 

{48:12} And Joseph brought them out frombetween his knees, and he bowed himself with his face to the earth.

{48:13} And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand towardIsrael's left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel's righthand, and brought [them] near unto him. 

{48:14} And Israel stretchedout his right hand, and laid it upon Ephraim's head, who [was] theyounger, and his left hand upon Manasseh's head, guiding his handswittingly; for Manasseh [was] the firstborn.   

{48:15} And he blessed Joseph, and said, God, before whom my fathersAbraham and Isaac did walk, the God which fed me all my life long untothis day, 

{48:16} The Angel which redeemed me from all evil, bless thelads; and let my name be named on them, and the name of my fathersAbraham and Isaac; and let them grow into a multitude in the midst ofthe earth. 

{48:17} And when Joseph saw that his father laid his righthand upon the head of Ephraim, it displeased him: and he held up hisfather's hand, to remove it from Ephraim's head unto Manasseh's head.

{48:18} And Joseph said unto his father, Not so, my father: for this[is] the firstborn; put thy right hand upon his head. 

{48:19} And hisfather refused, and said, I know [it,] my son, I know [it:] he alsoshall become a people, and he also shall be great: but truly hisyounger brother shall be greater than he, and his seed shall become amultitude of nations. 

{48:20} And he blessed them that day, saying, Inthee shall Israel bless, saying, God make thee as Ephraim and asManasseh: and he set Ephraim before Manasseh. 

{48:21} And Israel saidunto Joseph, Behold, I die: but God shall be with you, and bring youagain unto the land of your fathers. 

{48:22} Moreover I have given tothee one portion above thy brethren, which I took out of the hand ofthe Amorite with my sword and with my bow.   

{49:1} And Jacob called unto his sons, and said, Gather yourselvestogether, that I may tell you [that] which shall befall you in the lastdays. 

{49:2} Gather yourselves together, and hear, ye sons of Jacob;and hearken unto Israel your father.   

{49:3} Reuben, thou [art] my firstborn, my might, and the beginningof my strength, the excellency of dignity, and the excellency of power:

{49:4} Unstable as water, thou shalt not excel; because thou wentest upto thy father's bed; then defiledst thou [it:] he went up to my couch.   

{49:5} Simeon and Levi [are] brethren; instruments of cruelty [arein] their habitations. 

{49:6} O my soul, come not thou into theirsecret; unto their assembly, mine honour, be not thou united: for intheir anger they slew a man, and in their selfwill they digged down awall. 

{49:7} Cursed [be] their anger, for [it was] fierce; and theirwrath, for it was cruel: I will divide them in Jacob, and scatter themin Israel.   

{49:8} Judah, thou [art he] whom thy brethren shall praise: thy hand[shall be] in the neck of thine enemies; thy father's children shallbow down before thee. 

{49:9} Judah [is] a lion's whelp: from the prey,my son, thou art gone up: he stooped down, he couched as a lion, and asan old lion; who shall rouse him up? 

{49:10} The sceptre shall notdepart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet, until Shilohcome; and unto him [shall] the gathering of the people [be. ]

{49:11}Binding his foal unto the vine, and his ass's colt unto the choicevine; he washed his garments in wine, and his clothes in the blood ofgrapes: 

{49:12} His eyes [shall be] red with wine, and his teeth whitewith milk.   

{49:13} Zebulun shall dwell at the haven of the sea; and he [shallbe] for an haven of ships; and his border [shall be] unto Zidon.   

{49:14} Issachar [is] a strong ass couching down between twoburdens: 

{49:15} And he saw that rest [was] good, and the land that [itwas] pleasant; and bowed his shoulder to bear, and became a servantunto tribute.   

{49:16} Dan shall judge his people, as one of the tribes of Israel.

{49:17} Dan shall be a serpent by the way, an adder in the path, thatbiteth the horse heels, so that his rider shall fall backward. 

{49:18}I have waited for thy salvation, O LORD.   

{49:19} Gad, a troop shall overcome him: but he shall overcome atthe last.   

{49:20} Out of Asher his bread [shall be] fat, and he shall yieldroyal dainties.   

{49:21} Naphtali [is] a hind let loose: he giveth goodly words.   

{49:22} Joseph [is] a fruitful bough, [even] a fruitful bough by awell; [whose] branches run over the wall: 

{49:23} The archers havesorely grieved him, and shot [at him,] and hated him: 

{49:24} But hisbow abode in strength, and the arms of his hands were made strong bythe hands of the mighty [God] of Jacob; (from thence [is] the shepherd,the stone of Israel:) 

{49:25} [Even] by the God of thy father, whoshall help thee; and by the Almighty, who shall bless thee withblessings of heaven above, blessings of the deep that lieth under,blessings of the breasts, and of the womb: 

{49:26} The blessings of thyfather have prevailed above the blessings of my progenitors unto theutmost bound of the everlasting hills: they shall be on the head ofJoseph, and on the crown of the head of him that was separate from hisbrethren.   

{49:27} Benjamin shall ravin [as] a wolf: in the morning he shalldevour the prey, and at night he shall divide the spoil.   

{49:28} All these [are] the twelve tribes of Israel: and this [isit] that their father spake unto them, and blessed them; every oneaccording to his blessing he blessed them. 

{49:29} And he charged them,and said unto them, I am to be gathered unto my people: bury me with myfathers in the cave that [is] in the field of Ephron the Hittite,

{49:30} In the cave that [is] in the field of Machpelah, which [is]before Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought with thefield of Ephron the Hittite for a possession of a buryingplace. 

{49:31}There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife; there they buried Isaacand Rebekah his wife; and there I buried Leah. 

{49:32} The purchase ofthe field and of the cave that [is] therein [was] from the children ofHeth. 

{49:33} And when Jacob had made an end of commanding his sons, hegathered up his feet into the bed, and yielded up the ghost, and wasgathered unto his people.   

{50:1} And Joseph fell upon his father's face, and wept upon him,and kissed him. 

{50:2} And Joseph commanded his servants the physiciansto embalm his father: and the physicians embalmed Israel. 

{50:3} Andforty days were fulfilled for him; for so are fulfilled the days ofthose which are embalmed: and the Egyptians mourned for him threescoreand ten days. 

{50:4} And when the days of his mourning were past,Joseph spake unto the house of Pharaoh, saying, If now I have foundgrace in your eyes, speak, I pray you, in the ears of Pharaoh, saying,

{50:5} My father made me swear, saying, Lo, I die: in my grave which Ihave digged for me in the land of Canaan, there shalt thou bury me. Nowtherefore let me go up, I pray thee, and bury my father, and I willcome again. 

{50:6} And Pharaoh said, Go up, and bury thy father,according as he made thee swear.   

{50:7} And Joseph went up to bury his father: and with him went upall the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, and all theelders of the land of Egypt, 

{50:8} And all the house of Joseph, andhis brethren, and his father's house: only their little ones, and theirflocks, and their herds, they left in the land of Goshen. 

{50:9} Andthere went up with him both chariots and horsemen: and it was a verygreat company. 

{50:10} And they came to the threshingfloor of Atad,which [is] beyond Jordan, and there they mourned with a great and verysore lamentation: and he made a mourning for his father seven days.

{50:11} And when the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw themourning in the floor of Atad, they said, This [is] a grievous mourningto the Egyptians: wherefore the name of it was called Abel-mizraim,which [is] beyond Jordan. 

{50:12} And his sons did unto him accordingas he commanded them: 

{50:13} For his sons carried him into the land ofCanaan, and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, whichAbraham bought with the field for a possession of a buryingplace ofEphron the Hittite, before Mamre.   

{50:14} And Joseph returned into Egypt, he, and his brethren, andall that went up with him to bury his father, after he had buried hisfather.   

{50:15} And when Joseph's brethren saw that their father was dead,they said, Joseph will peradventure hate us, and will certainly requiteus all the evil which we did unto him. 

{50:16} And they sent amessenger unto Joseph, saying, Thy father did command before he died,saying, 

{50:17} So shall ye say unto Joseph, Forgive, I pray thee now,the trespass of thy brethren, and their sin; for they did unto theeevil: and now, we pray thee, forgive the trespass of the servants ofthe God of thy father. And Joseph wept when they spake unto him.

{50:18} And his brethren also went and fell down before his face; andthey said, Behold, we [be] thy servants. 

{50:19} And Joseph said untothem, Fear not: for [am] I in the place of God? 

{50:20} But as for you,ye thought evil against me; [but] God meant it unto good, to bring topass, as [it is] this day, to save much people alive. 

{50:21} Nowtherefore fear ye not: I will nourish you, and your little ones. And hecomforted them, and spake kindly unto them.   

{50:22} And Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he, and his father's house: andJoseph lived an hundred and ten years. 

{50:23} And Joseph saw Ephraim'schildren of the third [generation:] the children also of Machir the sonManasseh were brought up upon Joseph's knees. 

{50:24} And Joseph saidunto his brethren, I die: and God will surely visit you, and bring youout of this land unto the land which he sware to Abraham, to Isaac, andto Jacob. 

{50:25} And Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel,saying, God will surely visit you, and ye shall carry up my bones fromhence. 

{50:26} So Joseph died, [being] an hundred and ten years old:and they embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt.
