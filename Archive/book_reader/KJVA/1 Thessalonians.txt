{The First Epistle of Paul to the Thessalonians   

{1:1} Paul, and Silvanus, and Timotheus, unto the church of theThessalonians [which is] in God the Father and [in] the Lord JesusChrist: Grace [be] unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and theLord Jesus Christ. 

{1:2} We give thanks to God always for you all,making mention of you in our prayers; 

{1:3} Remembering without ceasingyour work of faith, and labour of love, and patience of hope in ourLord Jesus Christ, in the sight of God and our Father; 

{1:4} Knowing,brethren beloved, your election of God. 

{1:5} For our gospel came notunto you in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Ghost, and inmuch assurance; as ye know what manner of men we were among you foryour sake. 

{1:6} And ye became followers of us, and of the Lord, havingreceived the word in much affliction, with joy of the Holy Ghost: 

{1:7}So that ye were ensamples to all that believe in Macedonia and Achaia.

{1:8} For from you sounded out the word of the Lord not only inMacedonia and Achaia, but also in every place your faith to God-ward isspread abroad; so that we need not to speak any thing. 

{1:9} For theythemselves shew of us what manner of entering in we had unto you, andhow ye turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God;

{1:10} And to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from thedead, [even] Jesus, which delivered us from the wrath to come.   

{2:1} For yourselves, brethren, know our entrance in unto you, thatit was not in vain: 

{2:2} But even after that we had suffered before,and were shamefully entreated, as ye know, at Philippi, we were bold inour God to speak unto you the gospel of God with much contention. 

{2:3}For our exhortation [was] not of deceit, nor of uncleanness, nor inguile: 

{2:4} But as we were allowed of God to be put in trust with thegospel, even so we speak; not as pleasing men, but God, which triethour hearts. 

{2:5} For neither at any time used we flattering words, asye know, nor a cloke of covetousness; God [is] witness: 

{2:6} Nor ofmen sought we glory, neither of you, nor [yet] of others, when we mighthave been burdensome, as the apostles of Christ. 

{2:7} But we weregentle among you, even as a nurse cherisheth her children: 

{2:8} Sobeing affectionately desirous of you, we were willing to have impartedunto you, not the gospel of God only, but also our own souls, becauseye were dear unto us. 

{2:9} For ye remember, brethren, our labour andtravail: for labouring night and day, because we would not bechargeable unto any of you, we preached unto you the gospel of God.

{2:10} Ye [are] witnesses, and God [also,] how holily and justly andunblameably we behaved ourselves among you that believe: 

{2:11} As yeknow how we exhorted and comforted and charged every one of you, as afather [doth] his children, 

{2:12} That ye would walk worthy of God,who hath called you unto his kingdom and glory.   

{2:13} For this cause also thank we God without ceasing, because,when ye received the word of God which ye heard of us, ye received [it]not [as] the word of men, but as it is in truth, the word of God, whicheffectually worketh also in you that believe. 

{2:14} For ye, brethren,became followers of the churches of God which in Judaea are in ChristJesus: for ye also have suffered like things of your own countrymen,even as they [have] of the Jews: 

{2:15} Who both killed the Lord Jesus,and their own prophets, and have persecuted us; and they please notGod, and are contrary to all men: 

{2:16} Forbidding us to speak to theGentiles that they might be saved, to fill up their sins alway: for thewrath is come upon them to the uttermost.   

{2:17} But we, brethren, being taken from you for a short time inpresence, not in heart, endeavoured the more abundantly to see yourface with great desire. 

{2:18} Wherefore we would have come unto you,even I Paul, once and again; but Satan hindered us. 

{2:19} For what[is] our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing? [Are] not even ye in thepresence of our Lord Jesus Christ at his coming? 

{2:20} For ye are ourglory and joy.   

{3:1} Wherefore when we could no longer forbear, we thought it goodto be left at Athens alone; 

{3:2} And sent Timotheus, our brother, andminister of God, and our fellowlabourer in the gospel of Christ, toestablish you, and to comfort you concerning your faith: 

{3:3} That noman should be moved by these afflictions: for yourselves know that weare appointed thereunto. 

{3:4} For verily, when we were with you, wetold you before that we should suffer tribulation; even as it came topass, and ye know. 

{3:5} For this cause, when I could no longerforbear, I sent to know your faith, lest by some means the tempter havetempted you, and our labour be in vain. 

{3:6} But now when Timotheuscame from you unto us, and brought us good tidings of your faith andcharity, and that ye have good remembrance of us always, desiringgreatly to see us, as we also [to see] you: 

{3:7} Therefore, brethren,we were comforted over you in all our affliction and distress by yourfaith: 

{3:8} For now we live, if ye stand fast in the Lord. 

{3:9} Forwhat thanks can we render to God again for you, for all the joywherewith we joy for your sakes before our God; 

{3:10} Night and daypraying exceedingly that we might see your face, and might perfect thatwhich is lacking in your faith? 

{3:11} Now God himself and our Father,and our Lord Jesus Christ, direct our way unto you. 

{3:12} And the Lordmake you to increase and abound in love one toward another, and towardall [men,] even as we [do] toward you: 

{3:13} To the end he maystablish your hearts unblameable in holiness before God, even ourFather, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all his saints.   

{4:1} Furthermore then we beseech you, brethren, and exhort [you] bythe Lord Jesus, that as ye have received of us how ye ought to walk andto please God, [so] ye would abound more and more. 

{4:2} For ye knowwhat commandments we gave you by the Lord Jesus. 

{4:3} For this is thewill of God, [even] your sanctification, that ye should abstain fromfornication: 

{4:4} That every one of you should know how to possess hisvessel in sanctification and honour; 

{4:5} Not in the lust ofconcupiscence, even as the Gentiles which know not God: 

{4:6} That no[man] go beyond and defraud his brother in [any] matter: because thatthe Lord [is] the avenger of all such, as we also have forewarned youand testified. 

{4:7} For God hath not called us unto uncleanness, butunto holiness. 

{4:8} He therefore that despiseth, despiseth not man,but God, who hath also given unto us his holy Spirit. 

{4:9} But astouching brotherly love ye need not that I write unto you: for yeyourselves are taught of God to love one another. 

{4:10} And indeed yedo it toward all the brethren which are in all Macedonia: but webeseech you, brethren, that ye increase more and more; 

{4:11} And thatye study to be quiet, and to do your own business, and to work withyour own hands, as we commanded you; 

{4:12} That ye may walk honestlytoward them that are without, and [that] ye may have lack of nothing.   

{4:13} But I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerningthem which are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others which have nohope. 

{4:14} For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even sothem also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him. 

{4:15} For thiswe say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive [and]remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which areasleep. 

{4:16} For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with ashout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: andthe dead in Christ shall rise first: 

{4:17} Then we which are alive[and] remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, tomeet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord. 

{4:18}Wherefore comfort one another with these words.   

{5:1} But of the times and the seasons, brethren, ye have no needthat I write unto you. 

{5:2} For yourselves know perfectly that the dayof the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night. 

{5:3} For when theyshall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction cometh upon them,as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall not escape. 

{5:4}But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtakeyou as a thief. 

{5:5} Ye are all the children of light, and thechildren of the day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness. 

{5:6}Therefore let us not sleep, as [do] others; but let us watch and besober. 

{5:7} For they that sleep sleep in the night; and they that bedrunken are drunken in the night. 

{5:8} But let us, who are of the day,be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love; and for anhelmet, the hope of salvation. 

{5:9} For God hath not appointed us towrath, but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ, 

{5:10} Whodied for us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we should live togetherwith him. 

{5:11} Wherefore comfort yourselves together, and edify oneanother, even as also ye do.   

{5:12} And we beseech you, brethren, to know them which labour amongyou, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you; 

{5:13} And toesteem them very highly in love for their work's sake. [And] be atpeace among yourselves. 

{5:14} Now we exhort you, brethren, warn themthat are unruly, comfort the feebleminded, support the weak, be patienttoward all [men. ]

{5:15} See that none render evil for evil unto any[man;] but ever follow that which is good, both among yourselves, andto all [men. ]

{5:16} Rejoice evermore. 

{5:17} Pray without ceasing.

{5:18} In every thing give thanks: for this is the will of God inChrist Jesus concerning you. 

{5:19} Quench not the Spirit. 

{5:20}Despise not prophesyings. 

{5:21} Prove all things; hold fast that whichis good. 

{5:22} Abstain from all appearance of evil. 

{5:23} And thevery God of peace sanctify you wholly; and [I pray God] your wholespirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of ourLord Jesus Christ. 

{5:24} Faithful [is] he that calleth you, who alsowill do [it.]   

{5:25} Brethren, pray for us.   

{5:26} Greet all the brethren with an holy kiss. 

{5:27} I charge youby the Lord that this epistle be read unto all the holy brethren.   

{5:28} The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ [be] with you. Amen.
