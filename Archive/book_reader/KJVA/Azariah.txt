{The Prayer of Azariah   

{1:1} And they walked in the midst of the fire, praising God, andblessing the Lord.   

{1:2} Then Azarias stood up, and prayed on this manner; and openinghis mouth in the midst of the fire said,   

{1:3} Blessed art thou, O Lord God of our fathers: thy name isworthy to be praised and glorified for evermore:   

{1:4} For thou art righteous in all the things that thou hast doneto us: yea, true are all thy works, thy ways are right, and all thyjudgments truth.   

{1:5} In all the things that thou hast brought upon us, and upon theholy city of our fathers, even Jerusalem, thou hast executed truejudgment: for according to truth and judgment didst thou bring allthese things upon us because of our sins.   

{1:6} For we have sinned and committed iniquity, departing from thee.   

{1:7} In all things have we trespassed, and not obeyed thycommandments, nor kept them, neither done as thou hast commanded us,that it might go well with us.   

{1:8} Wherefore all that thou hast brought upon us, and every thingthat thou hast done to us, thou hast done in true judgment.   

{1:9} And thou didst deliver us into the hands of lawless enemies,most hateful forsakers of God, and to an unjust king, and the mostwicked in all the world.   

{1:10} And now we cannot open our mouths, we are become a shame andreproach to thy servants; and to them that worship thee.   

{1:11} Yet deliver us not up wholly, for thy name's sake, neitherdisannul thou thy covenant:   

{1:12} And cause not thy mercy to depart from us, for thy belovedAbraham's sake, for thy servant Issac's sake, and for thy holy Israel'ssake;   

{1:13} To whom thou hast spoken and promised, that thou wouldestmultiply their seed as the stars of heaven, and as the sand that liethupon the seashore.   

{1:14} For we, O Lord, are become less than any nation, and be keptunder this day in all the world because of our sins.   

{1:15} Neither is there at this time prince, or prophet, or leader,or burnt offering, or sacrifice, or oblation, or incense, or place tosacrifice before thee, and to find mercy.   

{1:16} Nevertheless in a contrite heart and an humble spirit let usbe accepted.   

{1:17} Like as in the burnt offerings of rams and bullocks, and likeas in ten thousands of fat lambs: so let our sacrifice be in thy sightthis day, and grant that we may wholly go after thee: for they shallnot be confounded that put their trust in thee.   

{1:18} And now we follow thee with all our heart, we fear thee, andseek thy face.   

{1:19} Put us not to shame: but deal with us after thylovingkindness, and according to the multitude of thy mercies.   

{1:20} Deliver us also according to thy marvellous works, and giveglory to thy name, O Lord: and let all them that do thy servants hurtbe ashamed;   

{1:21} And let them be confounded in all their power and might, andlet their strength be broken;   

{1:22} And let them know that thou art God, the only God, andglorious over the whole world.   

{1:23} And the king's servants, that put them in, ceased not to makethe oven hot with rosin, pitch, tow, and small wood;   

{1:24} So that the flame streamed forth above the furnace forty andnine cubits.   

{1:25} And it passed through, and burned those Chaldeans it foundabout the furnace.   

{1:26} But the angel of the Lord came down into the oven togetherwith Azarias and his fellows, and smote the flame of the fire out ofthe oven;   

{1:27} And made the midst of the furnace as it had been a moistwhistling wind, so that the fire touched them not at all, neither hurtnor troubled them.   

{1:28} Then the three, as out of one mouth, praised, glorified, andblessed, God in the furnace, saying,   

{1:29} Blessed art thou, O Lord God of our fathers: and to bepraised and exalted above all for ever.   

{1:30} And blessed is thy glorious and holy name: and to be praisedand exalted above all for ever.
