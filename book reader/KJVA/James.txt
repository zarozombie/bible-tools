{The General Epistle of James   

{1:1} James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to thetwelve tribes which are scattered abroad, greeting.   

{1:2} My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into diverstemptations; 

{1:3} Knowing [this,] that the trying of your faithworketh patience. 

{1:4} But let patience have [her] perfect work, thatye may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing. 

{1:5} If any of you lackwisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all [men] liberally, andupbraideth not; and it shall be given him. 

{1:6} But let him ask infaith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the seadriven with the wind and tossed. 

{1:7} For let not that man think thathe shall receive any thing of the Lord. 

{1:8} A double minded man [is]unstable in all his ways. 

{1:9} Let the brother of low degree rejoicein that he is exalted: 

{1:10} But the rich, in that he is made low:because as the flower of the grass he shall pass away. 

{1:11} For thesun is no sooner risen with a burning heat, but it withereth the grass,and the flower thereof falleth, and the grace of the fashion of itperisheth: so also shall the rich man fade away in his ways. 

{1:12}Blessed [is] the man that endureth temptation: for when he is tried, heshall receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath promised to themthat love him. 

{1:13} Let no man say when he is tempted, I am temptedof God: for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he anyman: 

{1:14} But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his ownlust, and enticed. 

{1:15} Then when lust hath conceived, it bringethforth sin: and sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth death. 

{1:16}Do not err, my beloved brethren. 

{1:17} Every good gift and everyperfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights,with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning. 

{1:18} Of hisown will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kindof firstfruits of his creatures.   

{1:19} Wherefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift tohear, slow to speak, slow to wrath: 

{1:20} For the wrath of man workethnot the righteousness of God. 

{1:21} Wherefore lay apart all filthinessand superfluity of naughtiness, and receive with meekness the engraftedword, which is able to save your souls. 

{1:22} But be ye doers of theword, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves. 

{1:23} For ifany be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like unto a manbeholding his natural face in a glass: 

{1:24} For he beholdeth himself,and goeth his way, and straightway forgetteth what manner of man hewas. 

{1:25} But whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, andcontinueth [therein,] he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer ofthe work, this man shall be blessed in his deed. 

{1:26} If any manamong you seem to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, butdeceiveth his own heart, this man's religion [is] vain. 

{1:27} Purereligion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit thefatherless and widows in their affliction, [and] to keep himselfunspotted from the world.   

{2:1} My brethren, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, [theLord] of glory, with respect of persons. 

{2:2} For if there come untoyour assembly a man with a gold ring, in goodly apparel, and there comein also a poor man in vile raiment; 

{2:3} And ye have respect to himthat weareth the gay clothing, and say unto him, Sit thou here in agood place; and say to the poor, Stand thou there, or sit here under myfootstool: 

{2:4} Are ye not then partial in yourselves, and are becomejudges of evil thoughts? 

{2:5} Hearken, my beloved brethren, Hath notGod chosen the poor of this world rich in faith, and heirs of thekingdom which he hath promised to them that love him? 

{2:6} But ye havedespised the poor. Do not rich men oppress you, and draw you before thejudgment seats? 

{2:7} Do not they blaspheme that worthy name by thewhich ye are called? 

{2:8} If ye fulfil the royal law according to thescripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, ye do well: 

{2:9}But if ye have respect to persons, ye commit sin, and are convinced ofthe law as transgressors. 

{2:10} For whosoever shall keep the wholelaw, and yet offend in one [point,] he is guilty of all. 

{2:11} For hethat said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill. Now if thoucommit no adultery, yet if thou kill, thou art become a transgressor ofthe law. 

{2:12} So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judged bythe law of liberty. 

{2:13} For he shall have judgment without mercy,that hath shewed no mercy; and mercy rejoiceth against judgment. 

{2:14}What [doth it] profit, my brethren, though a man say he hath faith, andhave not works? can faith save him? 

{2:15} If a brother or sister benaked, and destitute of daily food, 

{2:16} And one of you say untothem, Depart in peace, be ye warmed and filled; notwithstanding ye givethem not those things which are needful to the body; what [doth it]profit? 

{2:17} Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, beingalone. 

{2:18} Yea, a man may say, Thou hast faith, and I have works:shew me thy faith without thy works, and I will shew thee my faith bymy works. 

{2:19} Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well:the devils also believe, and tremble. 

{2:20} But wilt thou know, O vainman, that faith without works is dead? 

{2:21} Was not Abraham ourfather justified by works, when he had offered Isaac his son upon thealtar? 

{2:22} Seest thou how faith wrought with his works, and by workswas faith made perfect? 

{2:23} And the scripture was fulfilled whichsaith, Abraham believed God, and it was imputed unto him forrighteousness: and he was called the Friend of God. 

{2:24} Ye see thenhow that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only. 

{2:25}Likewise also was not Rahab the harlot justified by works, when she hadreceived the messengers, and had sent [them] out another way? 

{2:26}For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works isdead also.   

{3:1} My brethren, be not many masters, knowing that we shallreceive the greater condemnation. 

{3:2} For in many things we offendall. If any man offend not in word, the same [is] a perfect man, [and]able also to bridle the whole body. 

{3:3} Behold, we put bits in thehorses' mouths, that they may obey us; and we turn about their wholebody. 

{3:4} Behold also the ships, which though [they be] so great, and[are] driven of fierce winds, yet are they turned about with a verysmall helm, whithersoever the governor listeth. 

{3:5} Even so thetongue is a little member, and boasteth great things. Behold, how greata matter a little fire kindleth! 

{3:6} And the tongue [is] a fire, aworld of iniquity: so is the tongue among our members, that it defileththe whole body, and setteth on fire the course of nature; and it is seton fire of hell. 

{3:7} For every kind of beasts, and of birds, and ofserpents, and of things in the sea, is tamed, and hath been tamed ofmankind: 

{3:8} But the tongue can no man tame; [it is] an unruly evil,full of deadly poison. 

{3:9} Therewith bless we God, even the Father;and therewith curse we men, which are made after the similitude of God.

{3:10} Out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing. Mybrethren, these things ought not so to be. 

{3:11} Doth a fountain sendforth at the same place sweet [water] and bitter? 

{3:12} Can the figtree, my brethren, bear olive berries? either a vine, figs? so [can] nofountain both yield salt water and fresh. 

{3:13} Who [is] a wise manand endued with knowledge among you? let him shew out of a goodconversation his works with meekness of wisdom. 

{3:14} But if ye havebitter envying and strife in your hearts, glory not, and lie notagainst the truth. 

{3:15} This wisdom descendeth not from above, but[is] earthly, sensual, devilish. 

{3:16} For where envying and strife[is,] there [is] confusion and every evil work. 

{3:17} But the wisdomthat is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, [and] easy tobe intreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, andwithout hypocrisy. 

{3:18} And the fruit of righteousness is sown inpeace of them that make peace.   

{4:1} From whence [come] wars and fightings among you? [come they]not hence, [even] of your lusts that war in your members? 

{4:2} Yelust, and have not: ye kill, and desire to have, and cannot obtain: yefight and war, yet ye have not, because ye ask not. 

{4:3} Ye ask, andreceive not, because ye ask amiss, that ye may consume [it] upon yourlusts. 

{4:4} Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that thefriendship of the world is enmity with God? whosoever therefore will bea friend of the world is the enemy of God. 

{4:5} Do ye think that thescripture saith in vain, The spirit that dwelleth in us lusteth toenvy? 

{4:6} But he giveth more grace. Wherefore he saith, God resisteththe proud, but giveth grace unto the humble. 

{4:7} Submit yourselvestherefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you. 

{4:8}Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you. Cleanse [your] hands,[ye] sinners; and purify [your] hearts, [ye] double minded. 

{4:9} Beafflicted, and mourn, and weep: let your laughter be turned tomourning, and [your] joy to heaviness. 

{4:10} Humble yourselves in thesight of the Lord, and he shall lift you up. 

{4:11} Speak not evil oneof another, brethren. He that speaketh evil of [his] brother, andjudgeth his brother, speaketh evil of the law, and judgeth the law: butif thou judge the law, thou art not a doer of the law, but a judge.

{4:12} There is one lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy: whoart thou that judgest another?   

{4:13} Go to now, ye that say, To day or to morrow we will go intosuch a city, and continue there a year, and buy and sell, and get gain:

{4:14} Whereas ye know not what [shall be] on the morrow. For what [is]your life? It is even a vapour, that appeareth for a little time, andthen vanisheth away. 

{4:15} For that ye [ought] to say, If the Lordwill, we shall live, and do this, or that. 

{4:16} But now ye rejoice inyour boastings: all such rejoicing is evil. 

{4:17} Therefore to himthat knoweth to do good, and doeth [it] not, to him it is sin.   

{5:1} Go to now, [ye] rich men, weep and howl for your miseries thatshall come upon [you. ]

{5:2} Your riches are corrupted, and yourgarments are motheaten. 

{5:3} Your gold and silver is cankered; and therust of them shall be a witness against you, and shall eat your fleshas it were fire. Ye have heaped treasure together for the last days.

{5:4} Behold, the hire of the labourers who have reaped down yourfields, which is of you kept back by fraud, crieth: and the cries ofthem which have reaped are entered into the ears of the Lord ofsabaoth. 

{5:5} Ye have lived in pleasure on the earth, and been wanton;ye have nourished your hearts, as in a day of slaughter. 

{5:6} Ye havecondemned [and] killed the just; [and] he doth not resist you.   

{5:7} Be patient therefore, brethren, unto the coming of the Lord.Behold, the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth, andhath long patience for it, until he receive the early and latter rain.

{5:8} Be ye also patient; stablish your hearts: for the coming of theLord draweth nigh. 

{5:9} Grudge not one against another, brethren, lestye be condemned: behold, the judge standeth before the door. 

{5:10}Take, my brethren, the prophets, who have spoken in the name of theLord, for an example of suffering affliction, and of patience. 

{5:11}Behold, we count them happy which endure. Ye have heard of the patienceof Job, and have seen the end of the Lord; that the Lord is verypitiful, and of tender mercy. 

{5:12} But above all things, my brethren,swear not, neither by heaven, neither by the earth, neither by anyother oath: but let your yea be yea; and [your] nay, nay; lest ye fallinto condemnation. 

{5:13} Is any among you afflicted? let him pray. Isany merry? let him sing psalms. 

{5:14} Is any sick among you? let himcall for the elders of the church; and let them pray over him,anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord: 

{5:15} And the prayerof faith shall save the sick, and the Lord shall raise him up; and ifhe have committed sins, they shall be forgiven him. 

{5:16} Confess[your] faults one to another, and pray one for another, that ye may behealed. The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much.

{5:17} Elias was a man subject to like passions as we are, and heprayed earnestly that it might not rain: and it rained not on the earthby the space of three years and six months. 

{5:18} And he prayed again,and the heaven gave rain, and the earth brought forth her fruit. 

{5:19}Brethren, if any of you do err from the truth, and one convert him;

{5:20} Let him know, that he which converteth the sinner from the errorof his way shall save a soul from death, and shall hide a multitude ofsins.
