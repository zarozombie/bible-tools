{Micah   

{1:1} The word of the LORD that came to Micah the Morasthite in thedays of Jotham, Ahaz, [and] Hezekiah, kings of Judah, which he sawconcerning Samaria and Jerusalem. 

{1:2} Hear, all ye people; hearken, Oearth, and all that therein is: and let the Lord GOD be witness againstyou, the Lord from his holy temple. 

{1:3} For, behold, the LORD comethforth out of his place, and will come down, and tread upon the highplaces of the earth. 

{1:4} And the mountains shall be molten under him,and the valleys shall be cleft, as wax before the fire, [and] as thewaters [that are] poured down a steep place. 

{1:5} For thetransgression of Jacob [is] all this, and for the sins of the house ofIsrael. What [is] the transgression of Jacob? [is it] not Samaria? andwhat [are] the high places of Judah? [are they] not Jerusalem? 

{1:6}Therefore I will make Samaria as an heap of the field, [and] asplantings of a vineyard: and I will pour down the stones thereof intothe valley, and I will discover the foundations thereof. 

{1:7} And allthe graven images thereof shall be beaten to pieces, and all the hiresthereof shall be burned with the fire, and all the idols thereof will Ilay desolate: for she gathered [it] of the hire of an harlot, and theyshall return to the hire of an harlot. 

{1:8} Therefore I will wail andhowl, I will go stripped and naked: I will make a wailing like thedragons, and mourning as the owls. 

{1:9} For her wound [is] incurable;for it is come unto Judah; he is come unto the gate of my people,[even] to Jerusalem.   

{1:10} Declare ye [it] not at Gath, weep ye not at all: in the houseof Aphrah roll thyself in the dust. 

{1:11} Pass ye away, thouinhabitant of Saphir, having thy shame naked: the inhabitant of Zaanancame not forth in the mourning of Beth-ezel; he shall receive of youhis standing. 

{1:12} For the inhabitant of Maroth waited carefully forgood: but evil came down from the LORD unto the gate of Jerusalem.

{1:13} O thou inhabitant of Lachish, bind the chariot to the swiftbeast: she [is] the beginning of the sin to the daughter of Zion: forthe transgressions of Israel were found in thee. 

{1:14} Therefore shaltthou give presents to Moresheth-gath: the houses of Achzib [shall be] alie to the kings of Israel. 

{1:15} Yet will I bring an heir unto thee,O inhabitant of Mareshah: he shall come unto Adullam the glory ofIsrael. 

{1:16} Make thee bald, and poll thee for thy delicate children;enlarge thy baldness as the eagle; for they are gone into captivityfrom thee.   

{2:1} Woe to them that devise iniquity, and work evil upon theirbeds! when the morning is light, they practise it, because it is in thepower of their hand. 

{2:2} And they covet fields, and take [them] byviolence; and houses, and take [them] away: so they oppress a man andhis house, even a man and his heritage. 

{2:3} Therefore thus saith theLORD; Behold, against this family do I devise an evil, from which yeshall not remove your necks; neither shall ye go haughtily: for thistime [is] evil.   

{2:4} In that day shall [one] take up a parable against you, andlament with a doleful lamentation, [and] say, We be utterly spoiled: hehath changed the portion of my people: how hath he removed [it] fromme! turning away he hath divided our fields. 

{2:5} Therefore thou shalthave none that shall cast a cord by lot in the congregation of theLORD. 

{2:6} Prophesy ye not, [say they to them that] prophesy: theyshall not prophesy to them, [that] they shall not take shame.   

{2:7} O [thou that art] named the house of Jacob, is the spirit ofthe LORD straitened? [are] these his doings? do not my words do good tohim that walketh uprightly? 

{2:8} Even of late my people is risen up asan enemy: ye pull off the robe with the garment from them that pass bysecurely as men averse from war. 

{2:9} The women of my people have yecast out from their pleasant houses; from their children have ye takenaway my glory for ever. 

{2:10} Arise ye, and depart; for this [is] not[your] rest: because it is polluted, it shall destroy [you,] even witha sore destruction. 

{2:11} If a man walking in the spirit and falsehooddo lie, [saying,] I will prophesy unto thee of wine and of strongdrink; he shall even be the prophet of this people.   

{2:12} I will surely assemble, O Jacob, all of thee; I will surelygather the remnant of Israel; I will put them together as the sheep ofBozrah, as the flock in the midst of their fold: they shall make greatnoise by reason of [the multitude of] men. 

{2:13} The breaker is comeup before them: they have broken up, and have passed through the gate,and are gone out by it: and their king shall pass before them, and theLORD on the head of them.   

{3:1} And I said, Hear, I pray you, O heads of Jacob, and ye princesof the house of Israel; [Is it] not for you to know judgment? 

{3:2} Whohate the good, and love the evil; who pluck off their skin from offthem, and their flesh from off their bones; 

{3:3} Who also eat theflesh of my people, and flay their skin from off them; and they breaktheir bones, and chop them in pieces, as for the pot, and as fleshwithin the caldron. 

{3:4} Then shall they cry unto the LORD, but hewill not hear them: he will even hide his face from them at that time,as they have behaved themselves ill in their doings.   

{3:5} Thus saith the LORD concerning the prophets that make mypeople err, that bite with their teeth, and cry, Peace; and he thatputteth not into their mouths, they even prepare war against him. 

{3:6}Therefore night [shall be] unto you, that ye shall not have a vision;and it shall be dark unto you, that ye shall not divine; and the sunshall go down over the prophets, and the day shall be dark over them.

{3:7} Then shall the seers be ashamed, and the diviners confounded:yea, they shall all cover their lips; for [there is] no answer of God.   

{3:8} But truly I am full of power by the spirit of the LORD, and ofjudgment, and of might, to declare unto Jacob his transgression, and toIsrael his sin. 

{3:9} Hear this, I pray you, ye heads of the house ofJacob, and princes of the house of Israel, that abhor judgment, andpervert all equity. 

{3:10} They build up Zion with blood, and Jerusalemwith iniquity. 

{3:11} The heads thereof judge for reward, and thepriests thereof teach for hire, and the prophets thereof divine formoney: yet will they lean upon the LORD, and say, [Is] not the LORDamong us? none evil can come upon us. 

{3:12} Therefore shall Zion foryour sake be plowed [as] a field, and Jerusalem shall become heaps, andthe mountain of the house as the high places of the forest.   

{4:1} But in the last days it shall come to pass, [that] themountain of the house of the LORD shall be established in the top ofthe mountains, and it shall be exalted above the hills; and peopleshall flow unto it. 

{4:2} And many nations shall come, and say, Come,and let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, and to the house of theGod of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in hispaths: for the law shall go forth of Zion, and the word of the LORDfrom Jerusalem.   

{4:3} And he shall judge among many people, and rebuke strongnations afar off; and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, andtheir spears into pruninghooks: nation shall not lift up a swordagainst nation, neither shall they learn war any more. 

{4:4} But theyshall sit every man under his vine and under his fig tree; and noneshall make [them] afraid: for the mouth of the LORD of hosts hathspoken [it. ]

{4:5} For all people will walk every one in the name ofhis god, and we will walk in the name of the LORD our God for ever andever. 

{4:6} In that day, saith the LORD, will I assemble her thathalteth, and I will gather her that is driven out, and her that I haveafflicted; 

{4:7} And I will make her that halted a remnant, and herthat was cast far off a strong nation: and the LORD shall reign overthem in mount Zion from henceforth, even for ever.   

{4:8} And thou, O tower of the flock, the strong hold of thedaughter of Zion, unto thee shall it come, even the first dominion; thekingdom shall come to the daughter of Jerusalem. 

{4:9} Now why dostthou cry out aloud? [is there] no king in thee? is thy counsellorperished? for pangs have taken thee as a woman in travail. 

{4:10} Be inpain, and labour to bring forth, O daughter of Zion, like a woman intravail: for now shalt thou go forth out of the city, and thou shaltdwell in the field, and thou shalt go [even] to Babylon; there shaltthou be delivered; there the LORD shall redeem thee from the hand ofthine enemies.   

{4:11} Now also many nations are gathered against thee, that say,Let her be defiled, and let our eye look upon Zion. 

{4:12} But theyknow not the thoughts of the LORD, neither understand they his counsel:for he shall gather them as the sheaves into the floor. 

{4:13} Ariseand thresh, O daughter of Zion: for I will make thine horn iron, and Iwill make thy hoofs brass: and thou shalt beat in pieces many people:and I will consecrate their gain unto the LORD, and their substanceunto the Lord of the whole earth.   

{5:1} Now gather thyself in troops, O daughter of troops: he hathlaid siege against us: they shall smite the judge of Israel with a rodupon the cheek. 

{5:2} But thou, Bethlehem Ephratah, [though] thou belittle among the thousands of Judah, [yet] out of thee shall he comeforth unto me [that is] to be ruler in Israel; whose goings forth [havebeen] from of old, from everlasting. 

{5:3} Therefore will he give themup, until the time [that] she which travaileth hath brought forth: thenthe remnant of his brethren shall return unto the children of Israel.   

{5:4} And he shall stand and feed in the strength of the LORD, inthe majesty of the name of the LORD his God; and they shall abide: fornow shall he be great unto the ends of the earth. 

{5:5} And this [man]shall be the peace, when the Assyrian shall come into our land: andwhen he shall tread in our palaces, then shall we raise against himseven shepherds, and eight principal men. 

{5:6} And they shall wastethe land of Assyria with the sword, and the land of Nimrod in theentrances thereof: thus shall he deliver [us] from the Assyrian, whenhe cometh into our land, and when he treadeth within our borders. 

{5:7}And the remnant of Jacob shall be in the midst of many people as a dewfrom the LORD, as the showers upon the grass, that tarrieth not forman, nor waiteth for the sons of men.   

{5:8} And the remnant of Jacob shall be among the Gentiles in themidst of many people as a lion among the beasts of the forest, as ayoung lion among the flocks of sheep: who, if he go through, bothtreadeth down, and teareth in pieces, and none can deliver. 

{5:9} Thinehand shall be lifted up upon thine adversaries, and all thine enemiesshall be cut off. 

{5:10} And it shall come to pass in that day, saiththe LORD, that I will cut off thy horses out of the midst of thee, andI will destroy thy chariots: 

{5:11} And I will cut off the cities ofthy land, and throw down all thy strong holds: 

{5:12} And I will cutoff witchcrafts out of thine hand; and thou shalt have no [more]soothsayers: 

{5:13} Thy graven images also will I cut off, and thystanding images out of the midst of thee; and thou shalt no moreworship the work of thine hands. 

{5:14} And I will pluck up thy grovesout of the midst of thee: so will I destroy thy cities. 

{5:15} And Iwill execute vengeance in anger and fury upon the heathen, such as theyhave not heard.   

{6:1} Hear ye now what the LORD saith; Arise, contend thou beforethe mountains, and let the hills hear thy voice. 

{6:2} Hear ye, Omountains, the LORD'S controversy, and ye strong foundations of theearth: for the LORD hath a controversy with his people, and he willplead with Israel. 

{6:3} O my people, what have I done unto thee? andwherein have I wearied thee? testify against me. 

{6:4} For I broughtthee up out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed thee out of the house ofservants; and I sent before thee Moses, Aaron, and Miriam. 

{6:5} O mypeople, remember now what Balak king of Moab consulted, and what Balaamthe son of Beor answered him from Shittim unto Gilgal; that ye may knowthe righteousness of the LORD.   

{6:6} Wherewith shall I come before the LORD, [and] bow myselfbefore the high God? shall I come before him with burnt offerings, withcalves of a year old? 

{6:7} Will the LORD be pleased with thousands oframs, [or] with ten thousands of rivers of oil? shall I give myfirstborn [for] my transgression, the fruit of my body [for] the sin ofmy soul? 

{6:8} He hath shewed thee, O man, what [is] good; and whatdoth the LORD require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, andto walk humbly with thy God? 

{6:9} The LORD'S voice crieth unto thecity, and [the man of] wisdom shall see thy name: hear ye the rod, andwho hath appointed it.   

{6:10} Are there yet the treasures of wickedness in the house of thewicked, and the scant measure [that is] abominable? 

{6:11} Shall Icount [them] pure with the wicked balances, and with the bag ofdeceitful weights? 

{6:12} For the rich men thereof are full ofviolence, and the inhabitants thereof have spoken lies, and theirtongue [is] deceitful in their mouth. 

{6:13} Therefore also will I make[thee] sick in smiting thee, in making [thee] desolate because of thysins. 

{6:14} Thou shalt eat, but not be satisfied; and thy casting down[shall be] in the midst of thee; and thou shalt take hold, but shaltnot deliver; and [that] which thou deliverest will I give up to thesword. 

{6:15} Thou shalt sow, but thou shalt not reap; thou shalt treadthe olives, but thou shalt not anoint thee with oil; and sweet wine,but shalt not drink wine.   

{6:16} For the statutes of Omri are kept, and all the works of thehouse of Ahab, and ye walk in their counsels; that I should make thee adesolation, and the inhabitants thereof an hissing: therefore ye shallbear the reproach of my people.   

{7:1} Woe is me! for I am as when they have gathered the summerfruits, as the grapegleanings of the vintage: [there is] no cluster toeat: my soul desired the firstripe fruit. 

{7:2} The good [man] isperished out of the earth: and [there is] none upright among men: theyall lie in wait for blood; they hunt every man his brother with a net.   

{7:3} That they may do evil with both hands earnestly, the princeasketh, and the judge [asketh] for a reward; and the great [man,] heuttereth his mischievous desire: so they wrap it up. 

{7:4} The best ofthem [is] as a brier: the most upright [is sharper] than a thorn hedge:the day of thy watchmen [and] thy visitation cometh; now shall be theirperplexity.   

{7:5} Trust ye not in a friend, put ye not confidence in a guide:keep the doors of thy mouth from her that lieth in thy bosom. 

{7:6} Forthe son dishonoureth the father, the daughter riseth up against hermother, the daughter in law against her mother in law; a man's enemies[are] the men of his own house. 

{7:7} Therefore I will look unto theLORD; I will wait for the God of my salvation: my God will hear me.   

{7:8} Rejoice not against me, O mine enemy: when I fall, I shallarise; when I sit in darkness, the LORD [shall be] a light unto me.

{7:9} I will bear the indignation of the LORD, because I have sinnedagainst him, until he plead my cause, and execute judgment for me: hewill bring me forth to the light, [and] I shall behold hisrighteousness. 

{7:10} Then [she that is] mine enemy shall see [it,] andshame shall cover her which said unto me, Where is the LORD thy God?mine eyes shall behold her: now shall she be trodden down as the mireof the streets. 

{7:11} [In] the day that thy walls are to be built,[in] that day shall the decree be far removed. 

{7:12} [In] that day[also] he shall come even to thee from Assyria, and [from] thefortified cities, and from the fortress even to the river, and from seato sea, and [from] mountain to mountain. 

{7:13} Notwithstanding theland shall be desolate because of them that dwell therein, for thefruit of their doings.   

{7:14} Feed thy people with thy rod, the flock of thine heritage,which dwell solitarily [in] the wood, in the midst of Carmel: let themfeed [in] Bashan and Gilead, as in the days of old. 

{7:15} According tothe days of thy coming out of the land of Egypt will I shew unto himmarvellous [things.]   

{7:16} The nations shall see and be confounded at all their might:they shall lay [their] hand upon [their] mouth, their ears shall bedeaf. 

{7:17} They shall lick the dust like a serpent, they shall moveout of their holes like worms of the earth: they shall be afraid of theLORD our God, and shall fear because of thee. 

{7:18} Who [is] a Godlike unto thee, that pardoneth iniquity, and passeth by thetransgression of the remnant of his heritage? he retaineth not hisanger for ever, because he delighteth [in] mercy. 

{7:19} He will turnagain, he will have compassion upon us; he will subdue our iniquities;and thou wilt cast all their sins into the depths of the sea. 

{7:20}Thou wilt perform the truth to Jacob, [and] the mercy to Abraham, whichthou hast sworn unto our fathers from the days of old.
