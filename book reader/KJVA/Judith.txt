{The Book of Judith   

{1:1} In the twelfth year of the reign of Nabuchodonosor, whoreigned in Nineve, the great city; in the days of Arphaxad, whichreigned over the Medes in Ecbatane,   

{1:2} And built in Ecbatane walls round about of stones hewn threecubits broad and six cubits long, and made the height of the wallseventy cubits, and the breadth thereof fifty cubits:   

{1:3} And set the towers thereof upon the gates of it an hundredcubits high, and the breadth thereof in the foundation threescorecubits:   

{1:4} And he made the gates thereof, even gates that were raised tothe height of seventy cubits, and the breadth of them was forty cubits,for the going forth of his mighty armies, and for the setting in arrayof his footmen:   

{1:5} Even in those days king Nabuchodonosor made war with kingArphaxad in the great plain, which is the plain in the borders of Ragau.   

{1:6} And there came unto him all they that dwelt in the hillcountry, and all that dwelt by Euphrates, and Tigris and Hydaspes, andthe plain of Arioch the king of the Elymeans, and very many nations ofthe sons of Chelod, assembled themselves to the battle.   

{1:7} Then Nabuchodonosor king of the Assyrians sent unto all thatdwelt in Persia, and to all that dwelt westward, and to those thatdwelt in Cilicia, and Damascus, and Libanus, and Antilibanus, and toall that dwelt upon the sea coast,   

{1:8} And to those among the nations that were of Carmel, andGalaad, and the higher Galilee, and the great plain of Esdrelom,   

{1:9} And to all that were in Samaria and the cities thereof, andbeyond Jordan unto Jerusalem, and Betane, and Chelus, and Kades, andthe river of Egypt, and Taphnes, and Ramesse, and all the land of Gesem,   

{1:10} Until ye come beyond Tanis and Memphis, and to all theinhabitants of Egypt, until ye come to the borders of Ethiopia.   

{1:11} But all the inhabitants of the land made light of thecommandment of Nabuchodonosor king of the Assyrians, neither went theywith him to the battle; for they were not afraid of him: yea, he wasbefore them as one man, and they sent away his ambassadors from themwithout effect, and with disgrace.   

{1:12} Therefore Nabuchodonosor was very angry with all thiscountry, and sware by his throne and kingdom, that he would surely beavenged upon all those coasts of Cilicia, and Damascus, and Syria, andthat he would slay with the sword all the inhabitants of the land ofMoab, and the children of Ammon, and all Judea, and all that were inEgypt, till ye come to the borders of the two seas.   

{1:13} Then he marched in battle array with his power against kingArphaxad in the seventeenth year, and he prevailed in his battle: forhe overthrew all the power of Arphaxad, and all his horsemen, and allhis chariots,   

{1:14} And became lord of his cities, and came unto Ecbatane, andtook the towers, and spoiled the streets thereof, and turned the beautythereof into shame.   

{1:15} He took also Arphaxad in the mountains of Ragau, and smotehim through with his darts, and destroyed him utterly that day.   

{1:16} So he returned afterward to Nineve, both he and all hiscompany of sundry nations being a very great multitude of men of war,and there he took his ease, and banqueted, both he and his army, anhundred and twenty days.   

{2:1} And in the eighteenth year, the two and twentieth day of thefirst month, there was talk in the house of Nabuchodonosor king of theAssyrians that he should, as he said, avenge himself on all the earth.   

{2:2} So he called unto him all his officers, and all his nobles,and communicated with them his secret counsel, and concluded theafflicting of the whole earth out of his own mouth.   

{2:3} Then they decreed to destroy all flesh, that did not obey thecommandment of his mouth.   

{2:4} And when he had ended his counsel, Nabuchodonosor king of theAssyrians called Holofernes the chief captain of his army, which wasnext unto him, and said unto him.   

{2:5} Thus saith the great king, the lord of the whole earth,Behold, thou shalt go forth from my presence, and take with thee menthat trust in their own strength, of footmen an hundred and twentythousand; and the number of horses with their riders twelve thousand.   

{2:6} And thou shalt go against all the west country, because theydisobeyed my commandment.   

{2:7} And thou shalt declare unto that they prepare for me earth andwater: for I will go forth in my wrath against them and will cover thewhole face of the earth with the feet of mine army, and I will givethem for a spoil unto them:   

{2:8} So that their slain shall fill their valleys and brooks andthe river shall be filled with their dead, till it overflow:   

{2:9} And I will lead them captives to the utmost parts of all theearth.   

{2:10} Thou therefore shalt go forth. and take beforehand for me alltheir coasts: and if they will yield themselves unto thee, thou shaltreserve them for me till the day of their punishment.   

{2:11} But concerning them that rebel, let not thine eye spare them;but put them to the slaughter, and spoil them wheresoever thou goest.   

{2:12} For as I live, and by the power of my kingdom, whatsoever Ihave spoken, that will I do by mine hand.   

{2:13} And take thou heed that thou transgress none of thecommandments of thy lord, but accomplish them fully, as I havecommanded thee, and defer not to do them.   

{2:14} Then Holofernes went forth from the presence of his lord, andcalled all the governors and captains, and the officers of the army ofAssur;   

{2:15} And he mustered the chosen men for the battle, as his lordhad commanded him, unto an hundred and twenty thousand, and twelvethousand archers on horseback;   

{2:16} And he ranged them, as a great army is ordered for the war.   

{2:17} And he took camels and asses for their carriages, a verygreat number; and sheep and oxen and goats without number for theirprovision:   

{2:18} And plenty of victual for every man of the army, and verymuch gold and silver out of the king's house.   

{2:19} Then he went forth and all his power to go before kingNabuchodonosor in the voyage, and to cover all the face of the earthwestward with their chariots, and horsemen, and their chosen footmen.   

{2:20} A great number also sundry countries came with them likelocusts, and like the sand of the earth: for the multitude was withoutnumber.   

{2:21} And they went forth of Nineve three days' journey toward theplain of Bectileth, and pitched from Bectileth near the mountain whichis at the left hand of the upper Cilicia.   

{2:22} Then he took all his army, his footmen, and horsemen andchariots, and went from thence into the hill country;   

{2:23} And destroyed Phud and Lud, and spoiled all the children ofRasses, and the children of Israel, which were toward the wilderness atthe south of the land of the Chellians.   

{2:24} Then he went over Euphrates, and went through Mesopotamia,and destroyed all the high cities that were upon the river Arbonai,till ye come to the sea.   

{2:25} And he took the borders of Cilicia, and killed all thatresisted him, and came to the borders of Japheth, which were toward thesouth, over against Arabia.   

{2:26} He compassed also all the children of Madian, and burned uptheir tabernacles, and spoiled their sheepcotes.   

{2:27} Then he went down into the plain of Damascus in the time ofwheat harvest, and burnt up all their fields, and destroyed theirflocks and herds, also he spoiled their cities, and utterly wastedtheir countries, and smote all their young men with the edge of thesword.   

{2:28} Therefore the fear and dread of him fell upon all theinhabitants of the sea coasts, which were in Sidon and Tyrus, and themthat dwelt in Sur and Ocina, and all that dwelt in Jemnaan; and theythat dwelt in Azotus and Ascalon feared him greatly.   

{3:1} So they sent ambassadors unto him to treat of peace, saying,   

{3:2} Behold, we the servants of Nabuchodonosor the great king liebefore thee; use us as shall be good in thy sight.   

{3:3} Behold, our houses, and all our places, and all our fields ofwheat, and flocks, and herds, and all the lodges of our tents liebefore thy face; use them as it pleaseth thee.   

{3:4} Behold, even our cities and the inhabitants thereof are thyservants; come and deal with them as seemeth good unto thee.   

{3:5} So the men came to Holofernes, and declared unto him afterthis manner.   

{3:6} Then came he down toward the sea coast, both he and his army,and set garrisons in the high cities, and took out of them chosen menfor aid.   

{3:7} So they and all the country round about received them withgarlands, with dances, and with timbrels.   

{3:8} Yet he did cast down their frontiers, and cut down theirgroves: for he had decreed to destroy all the gods of the land, thatall nations should worship Nabuchodonosor only, and that all tonguesand tribes should call upon him as god.   

{3:9} Also he came over against Esdraelon near unto Judea, overagainst the great strait of Judea.   

{3:10} And he pitched between Geba and Scythopolis, and there hetarried a whole month, that he might gather together all the carriagesof his army.   

{4:1} Now the children of Israel, that dwelt in Judea, heard allthat Holofernes the chief captain of Nabuchodonosor king of theAssyrians had done to the nations, and after what manner he had spoiledall their temples, and brought them to nought.   

{4:2} Therefore they were exceedingly afraid of him, and weretroubled for Jerusalem, and for the temple of the Lord their God:   

{4:3} For they were newly returned from the captivity, and all thepeople of Judea were lately gathered together: and the vessels, and thealtar, and the house, were sanctified after the profanation.   

{4:4} Therefore they sent into all the coasts of Samaria, and thevillages and to Bethoron, and Belmen, and Jericho, and to Choba, andEsora, and to the valley of Salem:   

{4:5} And possessed themselves beforehand of all the tops of thehigh mountains, and fortified the villages that were in them, and laidup victuals for the provision of war: for their fields were of latereaped.   

{4:6} Also Joacim the high priest, which was in those days inJerusalem, wrote to them that dwelt in Bethulia, and Betomestham, whichis over against Esdraelon toward the open country, near to Dothaim,   

{4:7} Charging them to keep the passages of the hill country: for bythem there was an entrance into Judea, and it was easy to stop themthat would come up, because the passage was straight, for two men atthe most.   

{4:8} And the children of Israel did as Joacim the high priest hadcommanded them, with the ancients of all the people of Israel, whichdwelt at Jerusalem.   

{4:9} Then every man of Israel cried to God with great fervency, andwith great vehemency did they humble their souls:   

{4:10} Both they, and their wives and their children, and theircattle, and every stranger and hireling, and their servants bought withmoney, put sackcloth upon their loins.   

{4:11} Thus every man and women, and the little children, and theinhabitants of Jerusalem, fell before the temple, and cast ashes upontheir heads, and spread out their sackcloth before the face of theLord: also they put sackcloth about the altar,   

{4:12} And cried to the God of Israel all with one consentearnestly, that he would not give their children for a prey, and theirwives for a spoil, and the cities of their inheritance to destruction,and the sanctuary to profanation and reproach, and for the nations torejoice at.   

{4:13} So God heard their prayers, and looked upon theirafflictions: for the people fasted many days in all Judea and Jerusalembefore the sanctuary of the Lord Almighty.   

{4:14} And Joacim the high priest, and all the priests that stoodbefore the Lord, and they which ministered unto the Lord, had theirloins girt with sackcloth, and offered the daily burnt offerings, withthe vows and free gifts of the people,   

{4:15} And had ashes on their mitres, and cried unto the Lord withall their power, that he would look upon all the house of Israelgraciously.   

{5:1} Then was it declared to Holofernes, the chief captain of thearmy of Assur, that the children of Israel had prepared for war, andhad shut up the passages of the hill country, and had fortified all thetops of the high hills and had laid impediments in the champaigncountries:   

{5:2} Wherewith he was very angry, and called all the princes ofMoab, and the captains of Ammon, and all the governors of the sea coast,   

{5:3} And he said unto them, Tell me now, ye sons of Chanaan, whothis people is, that dwelleth in the hill country, and what are thecities that they inhabit, and what is the multitude of their army, andwherein is their power and strength, and what king is set over them, orcaptain of their army;   

{5:4} And why have they determined not to come and meet me, morethan all the inhabitants of the west.   

{5:5} Then said Achior, the captain of all the sons of Ammon, Let mylord now hear a word from the mouth of thy servant, and I will declareunto thee the truth concerning this people, which dwelleth near thee,and inhabiteth the hill countries: and there shall no lie come out ofthe mouth of thy servant.   

{5:6} This people are descended of the Chaldeans:   

{5:7} And they sojourned heretofore in Mesopotamia, because theywould not follow the gods of their fathers, which were in the land ofChaldea.   

{5:8} For they left the way of their ancestors, and worshipped theGod of heaven, the God whom they knew: so they cast them out from theface of their gods, and they fled into Mesopotamia, and sojourned theremany days.   

{5:9} Then their God commanded them to depart from the place wherethey sojourned, and to go into the land of Chanaan: where they dwelt,and were increased with gold and silver, and with very much cattle.   

{5:10} But when a famine covered all the land of Chanaan, they wentdown into Egypt, and sojourned there, while they were nourished, andbecame there a great multitude, so that one could not number theirnation.   

{5:11} Therefore the king of Egypt rose up against them, and dealtsubtilly with them, and brought them low with labouring in brick, andmade them slaves.   

{5:12} Then they cried unto their God, and he smote all the land ofEgypt with incurable plagues: so the Egyptians cast them out of theirsight.   

{5:13} And God dried the Red sea before them,   

{5:14} And brought them to mount Sina, and Cades-Barne, and castforth all that dwelt in the wilderness.   

{5:15} So they dwelt in the land of the Amorites, and they destroyedby their strength all them of Esebon, and passing over Jordan theypossessed all the hill country.   

{5:16} And they cast forth before them the Chanaanite, thePherezite, the Jebusite, and the Sychemite, and all the Gergesites, andthey dwelt in that country many days.   

{5:17} And whilst they sinned not before their God, they prospered,because the God that hateth iniquity was with them.   

{5:18} But when they departed from the way which he appointed them,they were destroyed in many battles very sore, and were led captivesinto a land that was not their's, and the temple of their God was castto the ground, and their cities were taken by the enemies.   

{5:19} But now are they returned to their God, and are come up fromthe places where they were scattered, and have possessed Jerusalem,where their sanctuary is, and are seated in the hill country; for itwas desolate.   

{5:20} Now therefore, my lord and governor, if there be any erroragainst this people, and they sin against their God, let us considerthat this shall be their ruin, and let us go up, and we shall overcomethem.   

{5:21} But if there be no iniquity in their nation, let my lord nowpass by, lest their Lord defend them, and their God be for them, and webecome a reproach before all the world.   

{5:22} And when Achior had finished these sayings, all the peoplestanding round about the tent murmured, and the chief men ofHolofernes, and all that dwelt by the sea side, and in Moab, spake thathe should kill him.   

{5:23} For, say they, we will not be afraid of the face of thechildren of Israel: for, lo, it is a people that have no strength norpower for a strong battle   

{5:24} Now therefore, lord Holofernes, we will go up, and they shallbe a prey to be devoured of all thine army.   

{6:1} And when the tumult of men that were about the council wasceased, Holofernes the chief captain of the army of Assur said untoAchior and all the Moabites before all the company of other nations,   

{6:2} And who art thou, Achior, and the hirelings of Ephraim, thatthou hast prophesied against us as to day, and hast said, that weshould not make war with the people of Israel, because their God willdefend them? and who is God but Nabuchodonosor?   

{6:3} He will send his power, and will destroy them from the face ofthe earth, and their God shall not deliver them: but we his servantswill destroy them as one man; for they are not able to sustain thepower of our horses.   

{6:4} For with them we will tread them under foot, and theirmountains shall be drunken with their blood, and their fields shall befilled with their dead bodies, and their footsteps shall not be able tostand before us, for they shall utterly perish, saith kingNabuchodonosor, lord of all the earth: for he said, None of my wordsshall be in vain.   

{6:5} And thou, Achior, an hireling of Ammon, which hast spokenthese words in the day of thine iniquity, shalt see my face no morefrom this day, until I take vengeance of this nation that came out ofEgypt.   

{6:6} And then shall the sword of mine army, and the multitude ofthem that serve me, pass through thy sides, and thou shalt fall amongtheir slain, when I return.   

{6:7} Now therefore my servants shall bring thee back into the hillcountry, and shall set thee in one of the cities of the passages:   

{6:8} And thou shalt not perish, till thou be destroyed with them.   

{6:9} And if thou persuade thyself in thy mind that they shall betaken, let not thy countenance fall: I have spoken it, and none of mywords shall be in vain.   

{6:10} Then Holofernes commanded his servants, that waited in histent, to take Achior, and bring him to Bethulia, and deliver him intothe hands of the children of Israel.   

{6:11} So his servants took him, and brought him out of the campinto the plain, and they went from the midst of the plain into the hillcountry, and came unto the fountains that were under Bethulia.   

{6:12} And when the men of the city saw them, they took up theirweapons, and went out of the city to the top of the hill: and every manthat used a sling kept them from coming up by casting of stones againstthem.   

{6:13} Nevertheless having gotten privily under the hill, they boundAchior, and cast him down, and left him at the foot of the hill, andreturned to their lord.   

{6:14} But the Israelites descended from their city, and came untohim, and loosed him, and brought him to Bethulia, and presented him tothe governors of the city:   

{6:15} Which were in those days Ozias the son of Micha, of the tribeof Simeon, and Chabris the son of Gothoniel, and Charmis the son ofMelchiel.   

{6:16} And they called together all the ancients of the city, andall their youth ran together, and their women, to the assembly, andthey set Achior in the midst of all their people. Then Ozias asked himof that which was done.   

{6:17} And he answered and declared unto them the words of thecouncil of Holofernes, and all the words that he had spoken in themidst of the princes of Assur, and whatsoever Holofernes had spokenproudly against the house of Israel.   

{6:18} Then the people fell down and worshipped God, and cried untoGod. saying,   

{6:19} O Lord God of heaven, behold their pride, and pity the lowestate of our nation, and look upon the face of those that aresanctified unto thee this day.   

{6:20} Then they comforted Achior, and praised him greatly.   

{6:21} And Ozias took him out of the assembly unto his house, andmade a feast to the elders; and they called on the God of Israel allthat night for help.   

{7:1} The next day Holofernes commanded all his army, and all hispeople which were come to take his part, that they should remove theircamp against Bethulia, to take aforehand the ascents of the hillcountry, and to make war against the children of Israel.   

{7:2} Then their strong men removed their camps in that day, and thearmy of the men of war was an hundred and seventy thousand footmen, andtwelve thousand horsemen, beside the baggage, and other men that wereafoot among them, a very great multitude.   

{7:3} And they camped in the valley near unto Bethulia, by thefountain, and they spread themselves in breadth over Dothaim even toBelmaim, and in length from Bethulia unto Cynamon, which is overagainst Esdraelon.   

{7:4} Now the children of Israel, when they saw the multitude ofthem, were greatly troubled, and said every one to his neighbour, Nowwill these men lick up the face of the earth; for neither the highmountains, nor the valleys, nor the hills, are able to bear theirweight.   

{7:5} Then every man took up his weapons of war, and when they hadkindled fires upon their towers, they remained and watched all thatnight.   

{7:6} But in the second day Holofernes brought forth all hishorsemen in the sight of the children of Israel which were in Bethulia,   

{7:7} And viewed the passages up to the city, and came to thefountains of their waters, and took them, and set garrisons of men ofwar over them, and he himself removed toward his people.   

{7:8} Then came unto him all the chief of the children of Esau, andall the governors of the people of Moab, and the captains of the seacoast, and said,   

{7:9} Let our lord now hear a word, that there be not an overthrowin thine army.   

{7:10} For this people of the children of Israel do not trust intheir spears, but in the height of the mountains wherein they dwell,because it is not easy to come up to the tops of their mountains.   

{7:11} Now therefore, my lord, fight not against them in battlearray, and there shall not so much as one man of thy people perish.   

{7:12} Remain in thy camp, and keep all the men of thine army, andlet thy servants get into their hands the fountain of water, whichissueth forth of the foot of the mountain:   

{7:13} For all the inhabitants of Bethulia have their water thence;so shall thirst kill them, and they shall give up their city, and weand our people shall go up to the tops of the mountains that are near,and will camp upon them, to watch that none go out of the city.   

{7:14} So they and their wives and their children shall be consumedwith fire, and before the sword come against them, they shall beoverthrown in the streets where they dwell.   

{7:15} Thus shalt thou render them an evil reward; because theyrebelled, and met not thy person peaceably.   

{7:16} And these words pleased Holofernes and all his servants, andhe appointed to do as they had spoken.   

{7:17} So the camp of the children of Ammon departed, and with themfive thousand of the Assyrians, and they pitched in the valley, andtook the waters, and the fountains of the waters of the children ofIsrael.   

{7:18} Then the children of Esau went up with the children of Ammon,and camped in the hill country over against Dothaim: and they sent someof them toward the south, and toward the east over against Ekrebel,which is near unto Chusi, that is upon the brook Mochmur; and the restof the army of the Assyrians camped in the plain, and covered the faceof the whole land; and their tents and carriages were pitched to a verygreat multitude.   

{7:19} Then the children of Israel cried unto the Lord their God,because their heart failed, for all their enemies had compassed themround about, and there was no way to escape out from among them.   

{7:20} Thus all the company of Assur remained about them, both theirfootmen, chariots, and horsemen, four and thirty days, so that alltheir vessels of water failed all the inhibitants of Bethulia.   

{7:21} And the cisterns were emptied, and they had not water todrink their fill for one day; for they gave them drink by measure.   

{7:22} Therefore their young children were out of heart, and theirwomen and young men fainted for thirst, and fell down in the streets ofthe city, and by the passages of the gates, and there was no longer anystrength in them.   

{7:23} Then all the people assembled to Ozias, and to the chief ofthe city, both young men, and women, and children, and cried with aloud voice, and said before all the elders,   

{7:24} God be judge between us and you: for ye have done us greatinjury, in that ye have not required peace of the children of Assur.   

{7:25} For now we have no helper: but God hath sold us into theirhands, that we should be thrown down before them with thirst and greatdestruction.   

{7:26} Now therefore call them unto you, and deliver the whole cityfor a spoil to the people of Holofernes, and to all his army.   

{7:27} For it is better for us to be made a spoil unto them, than todie for thirst: for we will be his servants, that our souls may live,and not see the death of our infants before our eyes, nor our wives norour children to die.   

{7:28} We take to witness against you the heaven and the earth, andour God and Lord of our fathers, which punisheth us according to oursins and the sins of our fathers, that he do not according as we havesaid this day.   

{7:29} Then there was great weeping with one consent in the midst ofthe assembly; and they cried unto the Lord God with a loud voice.   

{7:30} Then said Ozias to them, Brethren, be of good courage, let usyet endure five days, in the which space the Lord our God may turn hismercy toward us; for he will not forsake us utterly.   

{7:31} And if these days pass, and there come no help unto us, Iwill do according to your word.   

{7:32} And he dispersed the people, every one to their own charge;and they went unto the walls and towers of their city, and sent thewomen and children into their houses: and they were very low brought inthe city.   

{8:1} Now at that time Judith heard thereof, which was the daughterof Merari, the son of Ox, the son of Joseph, the son of Ozel, the sonof Elcia, the son of Ananias, the son of Gedeon, the son of Raphaim,the son of Acitho, the son of Eliu, the son of Eliab, the son ofNathanael, the son of Samael, the son of Salasadal, the son of Israel.   

{8:2} And Manasses was her husband, of her tribe and kindred, whodied in the barley harvest.   

{8:3} For as he stood overseeing them that bound sheaves in thefield, the heat came upon his head, and he fell on his bed, and died inthe city of Bethulia: and they buried him with his fathers in the fieldbetween Dothaim and Balamo.   

{8:4} So Judith was a widow in her house three years and four months.   

{8:5} And she made her a tent upon the top of her house, and put onsackcloth upon her loins and ware her widow's apparel.   

{8:6} And she fasted all the days of her widowhood, save the eves ofthe sabbaths, and the sabbaths, and the eves of the new moons, and thenew moons and the feasts and solemn days of the house of Israel.   

{8:7} She was also of a goodly countenance, and very beautiful tobehold: and her husband Manasses had left her gold, and silver, andmenservants and maidservants, and cattle, and lands; and she remainedupon them.   

{8:8} And there was none that gave her an ill word; as she fearedGod greatly.   

{8:9} Now when she heard the evil words of the people against thegovernor, that they fainted for lack of water; for Judith had heard allthe words that Ozias had spoken unto them, and that he had sworn todeliver the city unto the Assyrians after five days;   

{8:10} Then she sent her waitingwoman, that had the government ofall things that she had, to call Ozias and Chabris and Charmis, theancients of the city.   

{8:11} And they came unto her, and she said unto them, Hear me now,O ye governors of the inhabitants of Bethulia: for your words that yehave spoken before the people this day are not right, touching thisoath which ye made and pronounced between God and you, and havepromised to deliver the city to our enemies, unless within these daysthe Lord turn to help you.   

{8:12} And now who are ye that have tempted God this day, and standinstead of God among the children of men?   

{8:13} And now try the Lord Almighty, but ye shall never know anything.   

{8:14} For ye cannot find the depth of the heart of man, neither canye perceive the things that he thinketh: then how can ye search outGod, that hath made all these things, and know his mind, or comprehendhis purpose? Nay, my brethren, provoke not the Lord our God to anger.   

{8:15} For if he will not help us within these five days, he hathpower to defend us when he will, even every day, or to destroy usbefore our enemies.   

{8:16} Do not bind the counsels of the Lord our God: for God is notas man, that he may be threatened; neither is he as the son of man,that he should be wavering.   

{8:17} Therefore let us wait for salvation of him, and call upon himto help us, and he will hear our voice, if it please him.   

{8:18} For there arose none in our age, neither is there any now inthese days neither tribe, nor family, nor people, nor city among us,which worship gods made with hands, as hath been aforetime.   

{8:19} For the which cause our fathers were given to the sword, andfor a spoil, and had a great fall before our enemies.   

{8:20} But we know none other god, therefore we trust that he willnot despise us, nor any of our nation.   

{8:21} For if we be taken so, all Judea shall lie waste, and oursanctuary shall be spoiled; and he will require the profanation thereofat our mouth.   

{8:22} And the slaughter of our brethren, and the captivity of thecountry, and the desolation of our inheritance, will he turn upon ourheads among the Gentiles, wheresoever we shall be in bondage; and weshall be an offence and a reproach to all them that possess us.   

{8:23} For our servitude shall not be directed to favour: but theLord our God shall turn it to dishonour.   

{8:24} Now therefore, O brethren, let us shew an example to ourbrethren, because their hearts depend upon us, and the sanctuary, andthe house, and the altar, rest upon us.   

{8:25} Moreover let us give thanks to the Lord our God, which triethus, even as he did our fathers.   

{8:26} Remember what things he did to Abraham, and how he triedIsaac, and what happened to Jacob in Mesopotamia of Syria, when he keptthe sheep of Laban his mother's brother.   

{8:27} For he hath not tried us in the fire, as he did them, for theexamination of their hearts, neither hath he taken vengeance on us: butthe Lord doth scourge them that come near unto him, to admonish them.   

{8:28} Then said Ozias to her, All that thou hast spoken hast thouspoken with a good heart, and there is none that may gainsay thy words.   

{8:29} For this is not the first day wherein thy wisdom ismanifested; but from the beginning of thy days all the people haveknown thy understanding, because the disposition of thine heart is good.   

{8:30} But the people were very thirsty, and compelled us to do untothem as we have spoken, and to bring an oath upon ourselves, which wewill not break.   

{8:31} Therefore now pray thou for us, because thou art a godlywoman, and the Lord will send us rain to fill our cisterns, and weshall faint no more.   

{8:32} Then said Judith unto them, Hear me, and I will do a thing,which shall go throughout all generations to the children of our nation.   

{8:33} Ye shall stand this night in the gate, and I will go forthwith my waitingwoman: and within the days that ye have promised todeliver the city to our enemies the Lord will visit Israel by mine hand.   

{8:34} But enquire not ye of mine act: for I will not declare itunto you, till the things be finished that I do.   

{8:35} Then said Ozias and the princes unto her, Go in peace, andthe Lord God be before thee, to take vengeance on our enemies.   

{8:36} So they returned from the tent, and went to their wards.   

{9:1} Judith fell upon her face, and put ashes upon her head, anduncovered the sackcloth wherewith she was clothed; and about the timethat the incense of that evening was offered in Jerusalem in the houseof the Lord Judith cried with a loud voice, and said,   

{9:2} O Lord God of my father Simeon, to whom thou gavest a sword totake vengeance of the strangers, who loosened the girdle of a maid todefile her, and discovered the thigh to her shame, and polluted hervirginity to her reproach; for thou saidst, It shall not be so; and yetthey did so:   

{9:3} Wherefore thou gavest their rulers to be slain, so that theydyed their bed in blood, being deceived, and smotest the servants withtheir lords, and the lords upon their thrones;   

{9:4} And hast given their wives for a prey, and their daughters tobe captives, and all their spoils to be divided among thy dearchildren; which were moved with thy zeal, and abhorred the pollution oftheir blood, and called upon thee for aid: O God, O my God, hear mealso a widow.   

{9:5} For thou hast wrought not only those things, but also thethings which fell out before, and which ensued after; thou hast thoughtupon the things which are now, and which are to come.   

{9:6} Yea, what things thou didst determine were ready at hand, andsaid, Lo, we are here: for all thy ways are prepared, and thy judgmentsare in thy foreknowledge.   

{9:7} For, behold, the Assyrians are multiplied in their power; theyare exalted with horse and man; they glory in the strength of theirfootmen; they trust in shield, and spear, and bow, and sling; and knownot that thou art the Lord that breakest the battles: the Lord is thyname.   

{9:8} Throw down their strength in thy power, and bring down theirforce in thy wrath: for they have purposed to defile thy sanctuary, andto pollute the tabernacle where thy glorious name resteth and to castdown with sword the horn of thy altar.   

{9:9} Behold their pride, and send thy wrath upon their heads: giveinto mine hand, which am a widow, the power that I have conceived.   

{9:10} Smite by the deceit of my lips the servant with the prince,and the prince with the servant: break down their stateliness by thehand of a woman.   

{9:11} For thy power standeth not in multitude nor thy might instrong men: for thou art a God of the afflicted, an helper of theoppressed, an upholder of the weak, a protector of the forlorn, asaviour of them that are without hope.   

{9:12} I pray thee, I pray thee, O God of my father, and God of theinheritance of Israel, Lord of the heavens and earth, Creator of thewaters, king of every creature, hear thou my prayer:   

{9:13} And make my speech and deceit to be their wound and stripe,who have purposed cruel things against thy covenant, and thy hallowedhouse, and against the top of Sion, and against the house of thepossession of thy children.   

{9:14} And make every nation and tribe to acknowledge that thou artthe God of all power and might, and that there is none other thatprotecteth the people of Israel but thou.   

{10:1} Now after that she had ceased to cry unto the God of Israel,and bad made an end of all these words.   

{10:2} She rose where she had fallen down, and called her maid, andwent down into the house in the which she abode in the sabbath days,and in her feast days,   

{10:3} And pulled off the sackcloth which she had on, and put offthe garments of her widowhood, and washed her body all over with water,and anointed herself with precious ointment, and braided the hair ofher head, and put on a tire upon it, and put on her garments ofgladness, wherewith she was clad during the life of Manasses herhusband.   

{10:4} And she took sandals upon her feet, and put about her herbracelets, and her chains, and her rings, and her earrings, and all herornaments, and decked herself bravely, to allure the eyes of all menthat should see her.   

{10:5} Then she gave her maid a bottle of wine, and a cruse of oil,and filled a bag with parched corn, and lumps of figs, and with finebread; so she folded all these things together, and laid them upon her.   

{10:6} Thus they went forth to the gate of the city of Bethulia, andfound standing there Ozias and the ancients of the city, Chabris andCharmis.   

{10:7} And when they saw her, that her countenance was altered, andher apparel was changed, they wondered at her beauty very greatly, andsaid unto her.   

{10:8} The God, the God of our fathers give thee favour, andaccomplish thine enterprizes to the glory of the children of Israel,and to the exaltation of Jerusalem. Then they worshipped God.   

{10:9} And she said unto them, Command the gates of the city to beopened unto me, that I may go forth to accomplish the things whereof yehave spoken with me. So they commanded the young men to open unto her,as she had spoken.   

{10:10} And when they had done so, Judith went out, she, and hermaid with her; and the men of the city looked after her, until she wasgone down the mountain, and till she had passed the valley, and couldsee her no more.   

{10:11} Thus they went straight forth in the valley: and the firstwatch of the Assyrians met her,   

{10:12} And took her, and asked her, Of what people art thou? andwhence comest thou? and whither goest thou? And she said, I am a womanof the Hebrews, and am fled from them: for they shall be given you tobe consumed:   

{10:13} And I am coming before Holofernes the chief captain of yourarmy, to declare words of truth; and I will shew him a way, whereby heshall go, and win all the hill country, without losing the body or lifeof any one of his men.   

{10:14} Now when the men heard her words, and beheld hercountenance, they wondered greatly at her beauty, and said unto her,   

{10:15} Thou hast saved thy life, in that thou hast hasted to comedown to the presence of our lord: now therefore come to his tent, andsome of us shall conduct thee, until they have delivered thee to hishands.   

{10:16} And when thou standest before him, be not afraid in thineheart, but shew unto him according to thy word; and he will entreatthee well.   

{10:17} Then they chose out of them an hundred men to accompany herand her maid; and they brought her to the tent of Holofernes.   

{10:18} Then was there a concourse throughout all the camp: for hercoming was noised among the tents, and they came about her, as shestood without the tent of Holofernes, till they told him of her.   

{10:19} And they wondered at her beauty, and admired the children ofIsrael because of her, and every one said to his neighbour, Who woulddespise this people, that have among them such women? surely it is notgood that one man of them be left who being let go might deceive thewhole earth.   

{10:20} And they that lay near Holofernes went out, and all hisservants and they brought her into the tent.   

{10:21} Now Holofernes rested upon his bed under a canopy, which waswoven with purple, and gold, and emeralds, and precious stones.   

{10:22} So they shewed him of her; and he came out before his tentwith silver lamps going before him.   

{10:23} And when Judith was come before him and his servants theyall marvelled at the beauty of her countenance; and she fell down uponher face, and did reverence unto him: and his servants took her up.   

{11:1} Then said Holofernes unto her, Woman, be of good comfort,fear not in thine heart: for I never hurt any that was willing to serveNabuchodonosor, the king of all the earth.   

{11:2} Now therefore, if thy people that dwelleth in the mountainshad not set light by me, I would not have lifted up my spear againstthem: but they have done these things to themselves.   

{11:3} But now tell me wherefore thou art fled from them, and artcome unto us: for thou art come for safeguard; be of good comfort, thoushalt live this night, and hereafter:   

{11:4} For none shall hurt thee, but entreat thee well, as they dothe servants of king Nabuchodonosor my lord.   

{11:5} Then Judith said unto him, Receive the words of thy servant,and suffer thine handmaid to speak in thy presence, and I will declareno lie to my lord this night.   

{11:6} And if thou wilt follow the words of thine handmaid, God willbring the thing perfectly to pass by thee; and my lord shall not failof his purposes.   

{11:7} As Nabuchodonosor king of all the earth liveth, and as hispower liveth, who hath sent thee for the upholding of every livingthing: for not only men shall serve him by thee, but also the beasts ofthe field, and the cattle, and the fowls of the air, shall live by thypower under Nabuchodonosor and all his house.   

{11:8} For we have heard of thy wisdom and thy policies, and it isreported in all the earth, that thou only art excellent in all thekingdom, and mighty in knowledge, and wonderful in feats of war.   

{11:9} Now as concerning the matter, which Achior did speak in thycouncil, we have heard his words; for the men of Bethulia saved him,and he declared unto them all that he had spoken unto thee.   

{11:10} Therefore, O lord and governor, respect not his word; butlay it up in thine heart, for it is true: for our nation shall not bepunished, neither can sword prevail against them, except they sinagainst their God.   

{11:11} And now, that my lord be not defeated and frustrate of hispurpose, even death is now fallen upon them, and their sin hathovertaken them, wherewith they will provoke their God to angerwhensoever they shall do that which is not fit to be done:   

{11:12} For their victuals fail them, and all their water is scant,and they have determined to lay hands upon their cattle, and purposedto consume all those things, that God hath forbidden them to eat by hislaws:   

{11:13} And are resolved to spend the firstfruits of the the tenthsof wine and oil, which they had sanctified, and reserved for thepriests that serve in Jerusalem before the face of our God; the whichthings it is not lawful for any of the people so much as to touch withtheir hands.   

{11:14} For they have sent some to Jerusalem, because they also thatdwell there have done the like, to bring them a licence from the senate.   

{11:15} Now when they shall bring them word, they will forthwith doit, and they shall be given to thee to be destroyed the same day.   

{11:16} Wherefore I thine handmaid, knowing all this, am fled fromtheir presence; and God hath sent me to work things with thee, whereatall the earth shall be astonished, and whosoever shall hear it.   

{11:17} For thy servant is religious, and serveth the God of heavenday and night: now therefore, my lord, I will remain with thee, and thyservant will go out by night into the valley, and I will pray unto God,and he will tell me when they have committed their sins:   

{11:18} And I will come and shew it unto thee: then thou shalt goforth with all thine army, and there shall be none of them that shallresist thee.   

{11:19} And I will lead thee through the midst of Judea, until thoucome before Jerusalem; and I will set thy throne in the midst thereof;and thou shalt drive them as sheep that have no shepherd, and a dogshall not so much as open his mouth at thee: for these things were toldme according to my foreknowledge, and they were declared unto me, and Iam sent to tell thee.   

{11:20} Then her words pleased Holofernes and all his servants; andthey marvelled at her wisdom, and said,   

{11:21} There is not such a woman from one end of the earth to theother, both for beauty of face, and wisdom of words.   

{11:22} Likewise Holofernes said unto her. God hath done well tosend thee before the people, that strength might be in our hands anddestruction upon them that lightly regard my lord.   

{11:23} And now thou art both beautiful in thy countenance, andwitty in thy words: surely if thou do as thou hast spoken thy God shallbe my God, and thou shalt dwell in the house of king Nabuchodonosor,and shalt be renowned through the whole earth.   

{12:1} Then he commanded to bring her in where his plate was set;and bade that they should prepare for her of his own meats, and thatshe should drink of his own wine.   

{12:2} And Judith said, I will not eat thereof, lest there be anoffence: but provision shall be made for me of the things that I havebrought.   

{12:3} Then Holofernes said unto her, If thy provision should fail,how should we give thee the like? for there be none with us of thynation.   

{12:4} Then said Judith unto him As thy soul liveth, my lord, thinehandmaid shall not spend those things that I have, before the Lord workby mine hand the things that he hath determined.   

{12:5} Then the servants of Holofernes brought her into the tent,and she slept till midnight, and she arose when it was toward themorning watch,   

{12:6} And sent to Holofernes, saving, Let my lord now command thatthine handmaid may go forth unto prayer.   

{12:7} Then Holofernes commanded his guard that they should not stayher: thus she abode in the camp three days, and went out in the nightinto the valley of Bethulia, and washed herself in a fountain of waterby the camp.   

{12:8} And when she came out, she besought the Lord God of Israel todirect her way to the raising up of the children of her people.   

{12:9} So she came in clean, and remained in the tent, until she dideat her meat at evening.   

{12:10} And in the fourth day Holofernes made a feast to his ownservants only, and called none of the officers to the banquet.   

{12:11} Then said he to Bagoas the eunuch, who had charge over allthat he had, Go now, and persuade this Hebrew woman which is with thee,that she come unto us, and eat and drink with us.   

{12:12} For, lo, it will be a shame for our person, if we shall letsuch a woman go, not having had her company; for if we draw her notunto us, she will laugh us to scorn.   

{12:13} Then went Bagoas from the presence of Holofernes, and cameto her, and he said, Let not this fair damsel fear to come to my lord,and to be honoured in his presence, and drink wine, and be merry withus and be made this day as one of the daughters of the Assyrians, whichserve in the house of Nabuchodonosor.   

{12:14} Then said Judith unto him, Who am I now, that I shouldgainsay my lord? surely whatsoever pleaseth him I will do speedily, andit shall be my joy unto the day of my death.   

{12:15} So she arose, and decked herself with her apparel and allher woman's attire, and her maid went and laid soft skins on the groundfor her over against Holofernes, which she had received of Bagoas farher daily use, that she might sit and eat upon them.   

{12:16} Now when Judith came in and sat down, Holofernes his heartwas ravished with her, and his mind was moved, and he desired greatlyher company; for he waited a time to deceive her, from the day that hehad seen her.   

{12:17} Then said Holofernes unto her, Drink now, and be merry withus.   

{12:18} So Judith said, I will drink now, my lord, because my lifeis magnified in me this day more than all the days since I was born.   

{12:19} Then she took and ate and drank before him what her maid hadprepared.   

{12:20} And Holofernes took great delight in her, and drank morewine than he had drunk at any time in one day since he was born.   

{13:1} Now when the evening was come, his servants made haste todepart, and Bagoas shut his tent without, and dismissed the waitersfrom the presence of his lord; and they went to their beds: for theywere all weary, because the feast had been long.   

{13:2} And Judith was left along in the tent, and Holofernes lyingalong upon his bed: for he was filled with wine.   

{13:3} Now Judith had commanded her maid to stand without herbedchamber, and to wait for her. coming forth, as she did daily: forshe said she would go forth to her prayers, and she spake to Bagoasaccording to the same purpose.   

{13:4} So all went forth and none was left in the bedchamber,neither little nor great. Then Judith, standing by his bed, said in herheart, O Lord God of all power, look at this present upon the works ofmine hands for the exaltation of Jerusalem.   

{13:5} For now is the time to help thine inheritance, and to executethine enterprizes to the destruction of the enemies which are risenagainst us.   

{13:6} Then she came to the pillar of the bed, which was atHolofernes' head, and took down his fauchion from thence,   

{13:7} And approached to his bed, and took hold of the hair of hishead, and said, Strengthen me, O Lord God of Israel, this day.   

{13:8} And she smote twice upon his neck with all her might, and shetook away his head from him.   

{13:9} And tumbled his body down from the bed, and pulled down thecanopy from the pillars; and anon after she went forth, and gaveHolofernes his head to her maid;   

{13:10} And she put it in her bag of meat: so they twain wenttogether according to their custom unto prayer: and when they passedthe camp, they compassed the valley, and went up the mountain ofBethulia, and came to the gates thereof.   

{13:11} Then said Judith afar off, to the watchmen at the gate,Open, open now the gate: God, even our God, is with us, to shew hispower yet in Jerusalem, and his forces against the enemy, as he hatheven done this day.   

{13:12} Now when the men of her city heard her voice, they madehaste to go down to the gate of their city, and they called the eldersof the city.   

{13:13} And then they ran all together, both small and great, for itwas strange unto them that she was come: so they opened the gate, andreceived them, and made a fire for a light, and stood round about them.   

{13:14} Then she said to them with a loud voice, Praise, praise God,praise God, I say, for he hath not taken away his mercy from the houseof Israel, but hath destroyed our enemies by mine hands this night.   

{13:15} So she took the head out of the bag, and shewed it, and saidunto them, behold the head of Holofernes, the chief captain of the armyof Assur, and behold the canopy, wherein he did lie in his drunkenness;and the Lord hath smitten him by the hand of a woman.   

{13:16} As the Lord liveth, who hath kept me in my way that I went,my countenance hath deceived him to his destruction, and yet hath henot committed sin with me, to defile and shame me.   

{13:17} Then all the people were wonderfully astonished, and bowedthemselves and worshipped God, and said with one accord, Blessed bethou, O our God, which hast this day brought to nought the enemies ofthy people.   

{13:18} Then said Ozias unto her, O daughter, blessed art thou ofthe most high God above all the women upon the earth; and blessed bethe Lord God, which hath created the heavens and the earth, which hathdirected thee to the cutting off of the head of the chief of ourenemies.   

{13:19} For this thy confidence shall not depart from the heart ofmen, which remember the power of God for ever.   

{13:20} And God turn these things to thee for a perpetual praise, tovisit thee in good things because thou hast not spared thy life for theaffliction of our nation, but hast revenged our ruin, walking astraight way before our God. And all the people said; So be it, so beit.   

{14:1} Then said Judith unto them, Hear me now, my brethren, andtake this head, and hang it upon the highest place of your walls.   

{14:2} And so soon as the morning shall appear, and the sun shallcome forth upon the earth, take ye every one his weapons, and go forthevery valiant man out of the city, and set ye a captain over them, asthough ye would go down into the field toward the watch of theAssyrians; but go not down.   

{14:3} Then they shall take their armour, and shall go into theircamp, and raise up the captains of the army of Assur, and shall run tothe tent of Holofernes, but shall not find him: then fear shall fallupon them, and they shall flee before your face.   

{14:4} So ye, and all that inhabit the coast of Israel, shall pursuethem, and overthrow them as they go.   

{14:5} But before ye do these things, call me Achior the Ammonite,that he may see and know him that despised the house of Israel, andthat sent him to us as it were to his death.   

{14:6} Then they called Achior out of the house of Ozias; and whenhe was come, and saw the head of Holofernes in a man's hand in theassembly of the people, he fell down on his face, and his spirit failed.   

{14:7} But when they had recovered him, he fell at Judith's feet,and reverenced her, and said, Blessed art thou in all the tabernaclesof Juda, and in all nations, which hearing thy name shall be astonished.   

{14:8} Now therefore tell me all the things that thou hast done inthese days. Then Judith declared unto him in the midst of the peopleall that she had done, from the day that she went forth until that hourshe spake unto them.   

{14:9} And when she had left off speaking, the people shouted with aloud voice, and made a joyful noise in their city.   

{14:10} And when Achior had seen all that the God of Israel haddone, he believed in God greatly, and circumcised the flesh of hisforeskin, and was joined unto the house of Israel unto this day.   

{14:11} And as soon as the morning arose, they hanged the head ofHolofernes upon the wall, and every man took his weapons, and they wentforth by bands unto the straits of the mountain.   

{14:12} But when the Assyrians saw them, they sent to their leaders,which came to their captains and tribunes, and to every one of theirrulers.   

{14:13} So they came to Holofernes' tent, and said to him that hadthe charge of all his things, Waken now our lord: for the slaves havebeen bold to come down against us to battle, that they may be utterlydestroyed.   

{14:14} Then went in Bagoas, and knocked at the door of the tent;for he thought that he had slept with Judith.   

{14:15} But because none answered, he opened it, and went into thebedchamber, and found him cast upon the floor dead, and his head wastaken from him.   

{14:16} Therefore he cried with a loud voice, with weeping, andsighing, and a mighty cry, and rent his garments.   

{14:17} After he went into the tent where Judith lodged: and when hefound her not, he leaped out to the people, and cried,   

{14:18} These slaves have dealt treacherously; one woman of theHebrews hath brought shame upon the house of king Nabuchodonosor: for,behold, Holofernes lieth upon the ground without a head.   

{14:19} When the captains of the Assyrians' army heard these words,they rent their coats and their minds were wonderfully troubled, andthere was a cry and a very great noise throughout the camp.   

{15:1} And when they that were in the tents heard, they wereastonished at the thing that was done.   

{15:2} And fear and trembling fell upon them, so that there was noman that durst abide in the sight of his neighbour, but rushing out alltogether, they fled into every way of the plain, and of the hillcountry.   

{15:3} They also that had camped in the mountains round aboutBethulia fled away. Then the children of Israel, every one that was awarrior among them, rushed out upon them.   

{15:4} Then sent Ozias to Betomasthem, and to Bebai, and Chobai, andCola and to all the coasts of Israel, such as should tell the thingsthat were done, and that all should rush forth upon their enemies todestroy them.   

{15:5} Now when the children of Israel heard it, they all fell uponthem with one consent, and slew them unto Chobai: likewise also theythat came from Jerusalem, and from all the hill country, (for men hadtold them what things were done in the camp of their enemies) and theythat were in Galaad, and in Galilee, chased them with a greatslaughter, until they were past Damascus and the borders thereof.   

{15:6} And the residue that dwelt at Bethulia, fell upon the camp ofAssur, and spoiled them, and were greatly enriched.   

{15:7} And the children of Israel that returned from the slaughterhad that which remained; and the villages and the cities, that were inthe mountains and in the plain, gat many spoils: for the multitude wasvery great.   

{15:8} Then Joacim the high priest, and the ancients of the childrenof Israel that dwelt in Jerusalem, came to behold the good things thatGod had shewed to Israel, and to see Judith, and to salute her.   

{15:9} And when they came unto her, they blessed her with oneaccord, and said unto her, Thou art the exaltation of Jerusalem, thouart the great glory of Israel, thou art the great rejoicing of ournation:   

{15:10} Thou hast done all these things by thine hand: thou hastdone much good to Israel, and God is pleased therewith: blessed be thouof the Almighty Lord for evermore. And all the people said, So be it.   

{15:11} And the people spoiled the camp the space of thirty days:and they gave unto Judith Holofernes his tent, and all his plate, andbeds, and vessels, and all his stuff: and she took it and laid it onher mule; and made ready her carts, and laid them thereon.   

{15:12} Then all the women of Israel ran together to see her, andblessed her, and made a dance among them for her: and she took branchesin her hand, and gave also to the women that were with her.   

{15:13} And they put a garland of olive upon her and her maid thatwas with her, and she went before all the people in the dance, leadingall the women: and all the men of Israel followed in their armour withgarlands, and with songs in their mouths.   

{16:1} Then Judith began to sing this thanksgiving in all Israel,and all the people sang after her this song of praise.   

{16:2} And Judith said, Begin unto my God with timbrels, sing untomy Lord with cymbals: tune unto him a new psalm: exalt him, and callupon his name.   

{16:3} For God breaketh the battles: for among the camps in themidst of the people he hath delivered me out of the hands of them thatpersecuted me.   

{16:4} Assur came out of the mountains from the north, he came withten thousands of his army, the multitude whereof stopped the torrents,and their horsemen have covered the hills.   

{16:5} He bragged that he would burn up my borders, and kill myyoung men with the sword, and dash the sucking children against theground, and make mine infants as a prey, and my virgins as a spoil.   

{16:6} But the Almighty Lord hath disappointed them by the hand of awoman.   

{16:7} For the mighty one did not fall by the young men, neither didthe sons of the Titans smite him, nor high giants set upon him: butJudith the daughter of Merari weakened him with the beauty of hercountenance.   

{16:8} For she put off the garment of her widowhood for theexaltation of those that were oppressed in Israel, and anointed herface with ointment, and bound her hair in a tire, and took a linengarment to deceive him.   

{16:9} Her sandals ravished his eyes, her beauty took his mindprisoner, and the fauchion passed through his neck.   

{16:10} The Persians quaked at her boldness, and the Medes weredaunted at her hardiness.   

{16:11} Then my afflicted shouted for joy, and my weak ones criedaloud; but they were astonished: these lifted up their voices, but theywere overthrown.   

{16:12} The sons of the damsels have pierced them through, andwounded them as fugatives' children: they perished by the battle of theLord.   

{16:13} I will sing unto the Lord a new song: O Lord, thou art greatand glorious, wonderful in strength, and invincible.   

{16:14} Let all creatures serve thee: for thou spakest, and theywere made, thou didst send forth thy spirit, and it created them, andthere is none that can resist thy voice.   

{16:15} For the mountains shall be moved from their foundations withthe waters, the rocks shall melt as wax at thy presence: yet thou artmerciful to them that fear thee.   

{16:16} For all sacrifice is too little for a sweet savour untothee, and all the fat is not sufficient for thy burnt offering: but hethat feareth the Lord is great at all times.   

{16:17} Woe to the nations that rise up against my kindred! the LordAlmighty will take vengeance of them in the day of judgment, in puttingfire and worms in their flesh; and they shall feel them, and weep forever.   

{16:18} Now as soon as they entered into Jerusalem, they worshippedthe Lord; and as soon as the people were purified, they offered theirburnt offerings, and their free offerings, and their gifts.   

{16:19} Judith also dedicated all the stuff of Holofernes, which thepeople had given her, and gave the canopy, which she had taken out ofhis bedchamber, for a gift unto the Lord.   

{16:20} So the people continued feasting in Jerusalem before thesanctuary for the space of three months and Judith remained with them.   

{16:21} After this time every one returned to his own inheritance,and Judith went to Bethulia, and remained in her own possession, andwas in her time honourable in all the country.   

{16:22} And many desired her, but none knew her all the days of herlife, after that Manasses her husband was dead, and was gathered to hispeople.   

{16:23} But she increased more and more in honour, and waxed old inher husband's house, being an hundred and five years old, and made hermaid free; so she died in Bethulia: and they buried her in the cave ofher husband Manasses.   

{16:24} And the house of Israel lamented her seven days: and beforeshe died, she did distribute her goods to all them that were nearest ofkindred to Manasses her husband, and to them that were the nearest ofher kindred.   

{16:25} And there was none that made the children of Israel any moreafraid in the days of Judith, nor a long time after her death.
