{Ezra   

{1:1} Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the wordof the LORD by the mouth of Jeremiah might be fulfilled, the LORDstirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, that he made aproclamation throughout all his kingdom, and [put it] also in writing,saying, 

{1:2} Thus saith Cyrus king of Persia, The LORD God of heavenhath given me all the kingdoms of the earth; and he hath charged me tobuild him an house at Jerusalem, which [is] in Judah. 

{1:3} Who [isthere] among you of all his people? his God be with him, and let him goup to Jerusalem, which is in Judah, and build the house of the LORD Godof Israel, (he [is] the God,) which [is] in Jerusalem. 

{1:4} Andwhosoever remaineth in any place where he sojourneth, let the men ofhis place help him with silver, and with gold, and with goods, and withbeasts, beside the freewill offering for the house of God that [is] inJerusalem.   

{1:5} Then rose up the chief of the fathers of Judah and Benjamin,and the priests, and the Levites, with all [them] whose spirit God hadraised, to go up to build the house of the LORD which [is] inJerusalem. 

{1:6} And all they that [were] about them strengthened theirhands with vessels of silver, with gold, with goods, and with beasts,and with precious things, beside all [that] was willingly offered.   

{1:7} Also Cyrus the king brought forth the vessels of the house ofthe LORD, which Nebuchadnezzar had brought forth out of Jerusalem, andhad put them in the house of his gods; 

{1:8} Even those did Cyrus kingof Persia bring forth by the hand of Mithredath the treasurer, andnumbered them unto Sheshbazzar, the prince of Judah. 

{1:9} And this[is] the number of them: thirty chargers of gold, a thousand chargersof silver, nine and twenty knives,

{2:57} Thechildren of Shephatiah, the children of Hattil, the children ofPochereth of Zebaim, the children of Ami. 

{2:58} All the Nethinims, andthe children of Solomon's servants, [were] three hundred ninety andtwo. 

{2:59} And these [were] they which went up from Tel-melah,Tel-harsa, Cherub, Addan, [and] Immer: but they could not shew theirfather's house, and their seed, whether they [were] of Israel: 

{2:60}The children of Delaiah, the children of Tobiah, the children ofNekoda, six hundred fifty and two.   

{2:61} And of the children of the priests: the children of Habaiah,the children of Koz, the children of Barzillai; which took a wife ofthe daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite, and was called after theirname: 

{2:62} These sought their register [among] those that werereckoned by genealogy, but they were not found: therefore were they, aspolluted, put from the priesthood. 

{2:63} And the Tirshatha said untothem, that they should not eat of the most holy things, till therestood up a priest with Urim and with Thummim.   

{2:64} The whole congregation together [was] forty and two thousandthree hundred [and] threescore, 

{2:65} Beside their servants and theirmaids, of whom [there were] seven thousand three hundred thirty andseven: and [there were] among them two hundred singing men and singingwomen. 

{2:66} Their horses [were] seven hundred thirty and six; theirmules, two hundred forty and five; 

{2:67} Their camels, four hundredthirty and five; [their] asses, six thousand seven hundred and twenty.   

{2:68} And [some] of the chief of the fathers, when they came to thehouse of the LORD which [is] at Jerusalem, offered freely for the houseof God to set it up in his place: 

{2:69} They gave after their abilityunto the treasure of the work threescore and one thousand drams ofgold, and five thousand pound of silver, and one hundred priestsgarments. 

{2:70} So the priests, and the Levites, and [some] of thepeople, and the singers, and the porters, and the Nethinims, dwelt intheir cities, and all Israel in their cities.   

{3:1} And when the seventh month was come, and the children ofIsrael [were] in the cities, the people gathered themselves together asone man to Jerusalem. 

{3:2} Then stood up Jeshua the son of Jozadak,and his brethren the priests, and Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, andhis brethren, and builded the altar of the God of Israel, to offerburnt offerings thereon, as [it is] written in the law of Moses the manof God. 

{3:3} And they set the altar upon his bases; for fear [was]upon them because of the people of those countries: and they offeredburnt offerings thereon unto the LORD, [even] burnt offerings morningand evening. 

{3:4} They kept also the feast of tabernacles, as [it is]written, and [offered] the daily burnt offerings by number, accordingto the custom, as the duty of every day required; 

{3:5} And afterward[offered] the continual burnt offering, both of the new moons, and ofall the set feasts of the LORD that were consecrated, and of every onethat willingly offered a freewill offering unto the LORD. 

{3:6} Fromthe first day of the seventh month began they to offer burnt offeringsunto the LORD. But the foundation of the temple of the LORD was not[yet] laid. 

{3:7} They gave money also unto the masons, and to thecarpenters; and meat, and drink, and oil, unto them of Zidon, and tothem of Tyre, to bring cedar trees from Lebanon to the sea of Joppa,according to the grant that they had of Cyrus king of Persia.   

{3:8} Now in the second year of their coming unto the house of Godat Jerusalem, in the second month, began Zerubbabel the son ofShealtiel, and Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and the remnant of theirbrethren the priests and the Levites, and all they that were come outof the captivity unto Jerusalem; and appointed the Levites, from twentyyears old and upward, to set forward the work of the house of the LORD.

{3:9} Then stood Jeshua [with] his sons and his brethren, Kadmiel andhis sons, the sons of Judah, together, to set forward the workmen inthe house of God: the sons of Henadad, [with] their sons and theirbrethren the Levites. 

{3:10} And when the builders laid the foundationof the temple of the LORD, they set the priests in their apparel withtrumpets, and the Levites the sons of Asaph with cymbals, to praise theLORD, after the ordinance of David king of Israel. 

{3:11} And they sangtogether by course in praising and giving thanks unto the LORD; because[he is] good, for his mercy [endureth] for ever toward Israel. And allthe people shouted with a great shout, when they praised the LORD,because the foundation of the house of the LORD was laid. 

{3:12} Butmany of the priests and Levites and chief of the fathers, [who were]ancient men, that had seen the first house, when the foundation of thishouse was laid before their eyes, wept with a loud voice; and manyshouted aloud for joy: 

{3:13} So that the people could not discern thenoise of the shout of joy from the noise of the weeping of the people:for the people shouted with a loud shout, and the noise was heard afaroff.   

{4:1} Now when the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin heard that thechildren of the captivity builded the temple unto the LORD God ofIsrael; 

{4:2} Then they came to Zerubbabel, and to the chief of thefathers, and said unto them, Let us build with you: for we seek yourGod, as ye [do;] and we do sacrifice unto him since the days of Esar-haddon king of Assur, which brought us up hither. 

{4:3} But Zerubbabel,and Jeshua, and the rest of the chief of the fathers of Israel, saidunto them, Ye have nothing to do with us to build an house unto ourGod; but we ourselves together will build unto the LORD God of Israel,as king Cyrus the king of Persia hath commanded us. 

{4:4} Then thepeople of the land weakened the hands of the people of Judah, andtroubled them in building, 

{4:5} And hired counsellors against them, tofrustrate their purpose, all the days of Cyrus king of Persia, evenuntil the reign of Darius king of Persia. 

{4:6} And in the reign ofAhasuerus, in the beginning of his reign, wrote they [unto him] anaccusation against the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem.   

{4:7} And in the days of Artaxerxes wrote Bishlam, Mithredath,Tabeel, and the rest of their companions, unto Artaxerxes king ofPersia; and the writing of the letter [was] written in the Syriantongue, and interpreted in the Syrian tongue. 

{4:8} Rehum thechancellor and Shimshai the scribe wrote a letter against Jerusalem toArtaxerxes the king in this sort: 

{4:9} Then [wrote] Rehum thechancellor, and Shimshai the scribe, and the rest of their companions;the Dinaites, the Apharsathchites, the Tarpelites, the Apharsites, theArchevites, the Babylonians, the Susanchites, the Dehavites, [and] theElamites, 

{4:10} And the rest of the nations whom the great and nobleAsnapper brought over, and set in the cities of Samaria, and the rest[that are] on this side the river, and at such a time.   

{4:11} This [is] the copy of the letter that they sent unto him,[even] unto Artaxerxes the king; Thy servants the men on this side theriver, and at such a time. 

{4:12} Be it known unto the king, that theJews which came up from thee to us are come unto Jerusalem, buildingthe rebellious and the bad city, and have set up the walls [thereof,]and joined the foundations. 

{4:13} Be it known now unto the king, that,if this city be builded, and the walls set up [again, then] will theynot pay toll, tribute, and custom, and [so] thou shalt endamage therevenue of the kings. 

{4:14} Now because we have maintenance from [theking's] palace, and it was not meet for us to see the king's dishonour,therefore have we sent and certified the king; 

{4:15} That search maybe made in the book of the records of thy fathers: so shalt thou findin the book of the records, and know that this city [is] a rebelliouscity, and hurtful unto kings and provinces, and that they have movedsedition within the same of old time: for which cause was this citydestroyed. 

{4:16} We certify the king that, if this city be builded[again,] and the walls thereof set up, by this means thou shalt have noportion on this side the river.   

{4:17} [Then] sent the king an answer unto Rehum the chancellor, and[to] Shimshai the scribe, and [to] the rest of their companions thatdwell in Samaria, and [unto] the rest beyond the river, Peace, and atsuch a time. 

{4:18} The letter which ye sent unto us hath been plainlyread before me. 

{4:19} And I commanded, and search hath been made, andit is found that this city of old time hath made insurrection againstkings, and [that] rebellion and sedition have been made therein. 

{4:20}There have been mighty kings also over Jerusalem, which have ruled overall [countries] beyond the river; and toll, tribute, and custom, waspaid unto them. 

{4:21} Give ye now commandment to cause these men tocease, and that this city be not builded, until [another] commandmentshall be given from me. 

{4:22} Take heed now that ye fail not to dothis: why should damage grow to the hurt of the kings?   

{4:23} Now when the copy of king Artaxerxes' letter [was] readbefore Rehum, and Shimshai the scribe, and their companions, they wentup in haste to Jerusalem unto the Jews, and made them to cease by forceand power. 

{4:24} Then ceased the work of the house of God which [is]at Jerusalem. So it ceased unto the second year of the reign of Dariusking of Persia.   

{5:1} Then the prophets, Haggai the prophet, and Zechariah the sonof Iddo, prophesied unto the Jews that [were] in Judah and Jerusalem inthe name of the God of Israel, [even] unto them. 

{5:2} Then rose upZerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son of Jozadak, andbegan to build the house of God which [is] at Jerusalem: and with them[were] the prophets of God helping them.   

{5:3} At the same time came to them Tatnai, governor on this sidethe river, and Shethar- boznai, and their companions, and said thusunto them, Who hath commanded you to build this house, and to make upthis wall? 

{5:4} Then said we unto them after this manner, What are thenames of the men that make this building? 

{5:5} But the eye of theirGod was upon the elders of the Jews, that they could not cause them tocease, till the matter came to Darius: and then they returned answer byletter concerning this [matter.]   

{5:6} The copy of the letter that Tatnai, governor on this side theriver, and Shethar- boznai, and his companions the Apharsachites, which[were] on this side the river, sent unto Darius the king: 

{5:7} Theysent a letter unto him, wherein was written thus; Unto Darius the king,all peace. 

{5:8} Be it known unto the king, that we went into theprovince of Judea, to the house of the great God, which is builded withgreat stones, and timber is laid in the walls, and this work goeth faston, and prospereth in their hands. 

{5:9} Then asked we those elders,[and] said unto them thus, Who commanded you to build this house, andto make up these walls? 

{5:10} We asked their names also, to certifythee, that we might write the names of the men that [were] the chief ofthem. 

{5:11} And thus they returned us answer, saying, We are theservants of the God of heaven and earth, and build the house that wasbuilded these many years ago, which a great king of Israel builded andset up. 

{5:12} But after that our fathers had provoked the God ofheaven unto wrath, he gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar theking of Babylon, the Chaldean, who destroyed this house, and carriedthe people away into Babylon. 

{5:13} But in the first year of Cyrus theking of Babylon [the same] king Cyrus made a decree to build this houseof God. 

{5:14} And the vessels also of gold and silver of the house ofGod, which Nebuchadnezzar took out of the temple that [was] inJerusalem, and brought them into the temple of Babylon, those did Cyrusthe king take out of the temple of Babylon, and they were deliveredunto [one,] whose name [was] Sheshbazzar, whom he had made governor;

{5:15} And said unto him, Take these vessels, go, carry them into thetemple that [is] in Jerusalem, and let the house of God be builded inhis place. 

{5:16} Then came the same Sheshbazzar, [and] laid thefoundation of the house of God which [is] in Jerusalem: and since thattime even until now hath it been in building, and [yet] it is notfinished. 

{5:17} Now therefore, if [it seem] good to the king, letthere be search made in the king's treasure house, which [is] there atBabylon, whether it be [so,] that a decree was made of Cyrus the kingto build this house of God at Jerusalem, and let the king send hispleasure to us concerning this matter.   

{6:1} Then Darius the king made a decree, and search was made in thehouse of the rolls, where the treasures were laid up in Babylon. 

{6:2}And there was found at Achmetha, in the palace that is in the provinceof the Medes, a roll, and therein [was] a record thus written: 

{6:3} Inthe first year of Cyrus the king [the same] Cyrus the king made adecree [concerning] the house of God at Jerusalem, Let the house bebuilded, the place where they offered sacrifices, and let thefoundations thereof be strongly laid; the height thereof threescorecubits, [and] the breadth thereof threescore cubits; 

{6:4} [With] threerows of great stones, and a row of new timber: and let the expences begiven out of the king's house: 

{6:5} And also let the golden and silvervessels of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took forth out of thetemple which is at Jerusalem, and brought unto Babylon, be restored,and brought again unto the temple which is at Jerusalem, [every one] tohis place, and place [them] in the house of God. 

{6:6} Now [therefore,]Tatnai, governor beyond the river, Shethar-boznai, and your companionsthe Apharsachites, which [are] beyond the river, be ye far from thence:

{6:7} Let the work of this house of God alone; let the governor of theJews and the elders of the Jews build this house of God in his place.

{6:8} Moreover I make a decree what ye shall do to the elders of theseJews for the building of this house of God: that of the king's goods,[even] of the tribute beyond the river, forthwith expences be givenunto these men, that they be not hindered. 

{6:9} And that which theyhave need of, both young bullocks, and rams, and lambs, for the burntofferings of the God of heaven, wheat, salt, wine, and oil, accordingto the appointment of the priests which [are] at Jerusalem, let it begiven them day by day without fail: 

{6:10} That they may offersacrifices of sweet savours unto the God of heaven, and pray for thelife of the king, and of his sons. 

{6:11} Also I have made a decree,that whosoever shall alter this word, let timber be pulled down fromhis house, and being set up, let him be hanged thereon; and let hishouse be made a dunghill for this. 

{6:12} And the God that hath causedhis name to dwell there destroy all kings and people, that shall put totheir hand to alter [and] to destroy this house of God which is atJerusalem. I Darius have made a decree; let it be done with speed.   

{6:13} Then Tatnai, governor on this side the river, Shethar-boznai,and their companions, according to that which Darius the king had sent,so they did speedily. 

{6:14} And the elders of the Jews builded, andthey prospered through the prophesying of Haggai the prophet andZechariah the son of Iddo. And they builded, and finished [it,]according to the commandment of the God of Israel, and according to thecommandment of Cyrus, and Darius, and Artaxerxes king of Persia. 

{6:15}And this house was finished on the third day of the month Adar, whichwas in the sixth year of the reign of Darius the king.   

{6:16} And the children of Israel, the priests, and the Levites, andthe rest of the children of the captivity, kept the dedication of thishouse of God with joy, 

{6:17} And offered at the dedication of thishouse of God an hundred bullocks, two hundred rams, four hundred lambs;and for a sin offering for all Israel, twelve he goats, according tothe number of the tribes of Israel. 

{6:18} And they set the priests intheir divisions, and the Levites in their courses, for the service ofGod, which [is] at Jerusalem; as it is written in the book of Moses.

{6:19} And the children of the captivity kept the passover upon thefourteenth [day] of the first month. 

{6:20} For the priests and theLevites were purified together, all of them [were] pure, and killed thepassover for all the children of the captivity, and for their brethrenthe priests, and for themselves. 

{6:21} And the children of Israel,which were come again out of captivity, and all such as had separatedthemselves unto them from the filthiness of the heathen of the land, toseek the LORD God of Israel, did eat, 

{6:22} And kept the feast ofunleavened bread seven days with joy: for the LORD had made themjoyful, and turned the heart of the king of Assyria unto them, tostrengthen their hands in the work of the house of God, the God ofIsrael.   

{7:1} Now after these things, in the reign of Artaxerxes king ofPersia, Ezra the son of Seraiah, the son of Azariah, the son ofHilkiah, 

{7:2} The son of Shallum, the son of Zadok, the son of Ahitub,

{7:3} The son of Amariah, the son of Azariah, the son of Meraioth,

{7:4} The son of Zerahiah, the son of Uzzi, the son of Bukki, 

{7:5} Theson of Abishua, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son ofAaron the chief priest: 

{7:6} This Ezra went up from Babylon; and he[was] a ready scribe in the law of Moses, which the LORD God of Israelhad given: and the king granted him all his request, according to thehand of the LORD his God upon him. 

{7:7} And there went up [some] ofthe children of Israel, and of the priests, and the Levites, and thesingers, and the porters, and the Nethinims, unto Jerusalem, in theseventh year of Artaxerxes the king. 

{7:8} And he came to Jerusalem inthe fifth month, which [was] in the seventh year of the king. 

{7:9} Forupon the first [day] of the first month began he to go up from Babylon,and on the first [day] of the fifth month came he to Jerusalem,according to the good hand of his God upon him. 

{7:10} For Ezra hadprepared his heart to seek the law of the LORD, and to do [it,] and toteach in Israel statutes and judgments.   

{7:11} Now this [is] the copy of the letter that the king Artaxerxesgave unto Ezra the priest, the scribe, [even] a scribe of the words ofthe commandments of the LORD, and of his statutes to Israel. 

{7:12}Artaxerxes, king of kings, unto Ezra the priest, a scribe of the law ofthe God of heaven, perfect [peace,] and at such a time. 

{7:13} I make adecree, that all they of the people of Israel, and [of] his priests andLevites, in my realm, which are minded of their own freewill to go upto Jerusalem, go with thee. 

{7:14} Forasmuch as thou art sent of theking, and of his seven counsellors, to enquire concerning Judah andJerusalem, according to the law of thy God which [is] in thine hand;

{7:15} And to carry the silver and gold, which the king and hiscounsellors have freely offered unto the God of Israel, whosehabitation [is] in Jerusalem, 

{7:16} And all the silver and gold thatthou canst find in all the province of Babylon, with the freewilloffering of the people, and of the priests, offering willingly for thehouse of their God which [is] in Jerusalem: 

{7:17} That thou mayest buyspeedily with this money bullocks, rams, lambs, with their meatofferings and their drink offerings, and offer them upon the altar ofthe house of your God which [is] in Jerusalem. 

{7:18} And whatsoevershall seem good to thee, and to thy brethren, to do with the rest ofthe silver and the gold, that do after the will of your God. 

{7:19} Thevessels also that are given thee for the service of the house of thyGod, [those] deliver thou before the God of Jerusalem. 

{7:20} Andwhatsoever more shall be needful for the house of thy God, which thoushalt have occasion to bestow, bestow [it] out of the king's treasurehouse. 

{7:21} And I, [even] I Artaxerxes the king, do make a decree toall the treasurers which [are] beyond the river, that whatsoever Ezrathe priest, the scribe of the law of the God of heaven, shall requireof you, it be done speedily, 

{7:22} Unto an hundred talents of silver,and to an hundred measures of wheat, and to an hundred baths of wine,and to an hundred baths of oil, and salt without prescribing [how much.]

{7:23} Whatsoever is commanded by the God of heaven, let it bediligently done for the house of the God of heaven: for why shouldthere be wrath against the realm of the king and his sons? 

{7:24} Alsowe certify you, that touching any of the priests and Levites, singers,porters, Nethinims, or ministers of this house of God, it shall not belawful to impose toll, tribute, or custom, upon them. 

{7:25} And thou,Ezra, after the wisdom of thy God, that [is] in thine hand, setmagistrates and judges, which may judge all the people that [are]beyond the river, all such as know the laws of thy God; and teach yethem that know [them] not. 

{7:26} And whosoever will not do the law ofthy God, and the law of the king, let judgment be executed speedilyupon him, whether [it be] unto death, or to banishment, or toconfiscation of goods, or to imprisonment.   

{7:27} Blessed [be] the LORD God of our fathers, which hath put[such a thing] as this in the king's heart, to beautify the house ofthe LORD which [is] in Jerusalem: 

{7:28} And hath extended mercy untome before the king, and his counsellors, and before all the king'smighty princes. And I was strengthened as the hand of the LORD my God[was] upon me, and I gathered together out of Israel chief men to go upwith me.   

{8:1} These [are] now the chief of their fathers, and [this is] thegenealogy of them that went up with me from Babylon, in the reign ofArtaxerxes the king. 

{8:2} Of the sons of Phinehas; Gershom: of thesons of Ithamar; Daniel: of the sons of David; Hattush. 

{8:3} Of thesons of Shechaniah, of the sons of Pharosh; Zechariah: and with himwere reckoned by genealogy of the males an hundred and fifty. 

{8:4} Ofthe sons of Pahath- moab; Elihoenai the son of Zerahiah, and with himtwo hundred males. 

{8:5} Of the sons of Shechaniah; the son ofJahaziel, and with him three hundred males. 

{8:6} Of the sons also ofAdin; Ebed the son of Jonathan, and with him fifty males. 

{8:7} And ofthe sons of Elam; Jeshaiah the son of Athaliah, and with him seventymales. 

{8:8} And of the sons of Shephatiah; Zebadiah the son ofMichael, and with him fourscore males. 

{8:9} Of the sons of Joab;Obadiah the son of Jehiel, and with him two hundred and eighteen males.

{8:10} And of the sons of Shelomith; the son of Josiphiah, and with himan hundred and threescore males. 

{8:11} And of the sons of Bebai;Zechariah the son of Bebai, and with him twenty and eight males. 

{8:12}And of the sons of Azgad; Johanan the son of Hakkatan, and with him anhundred and ten males. 

{8:13} And of the last sons of Adonikam, whosenames [are] these, Eliphelet, Jeiel, and Shemaiah, and with themthreescore males. 

{8:14} Of the sons also of Bigvai; Uthai, and Zabbud,and with them seventy males.   

{8:15} And I gathered them together to the river than runneth toAhava; and there abode we in tents three days: and I viewed the people,and the priests, and found there none of the sons of Levi. 

{8:16} Thensent I for Eliezer, for Ariel, for Shemaiah, and for Elnathan, and forJarib, and for Elnathan, and for Nathan, and for Zechariah, and forMeshullam, chief men; also for Joiarib, and for Elnathan, men ofunderstanding. 

{8:17} And I sent them with commandment unto Iddo thechief at the place Casiphia, and I told them what they should say untoIddo, [and] to his brethren the Nethinims, at the place Casiphia, thatthey should bring unto us ministers for the house of our God. 

{8:18}And by the good hand of our God upon us they brought us a man ofunderstanding, of the sons of Mahli, the son of Levi, the son ofIsrael; and Sherebiah, with his sons and his brethren, eighteen; 

{8:19}And Hashabiah, and with him Jeshaiah of the sons of Merari, hisbrethren and their sons, twenty; 

{8:20} Also of the Nethinims, whomDavid and the princes had appointed for the service of the Levites, twohundred and twenty Nethinims: all of them were expressed by name.   

{8:21} Then I proclaimed a fast there, at the river of Ahava, thatwe might afflict ourselves before our God, to seek of him a right wayfor us, and for our little ones, and for all our substance. 

{8:22} ForI was ashamed to require of the king a band of soldiers and horsemen tohelp us against the enemy in the way: because we had spoken unto theking, saying, The hand of our God [is] upon all them for good that seekhim; but his power and his wrath [is] against all them that forsakehim. 

{8:23} So we fasted and besought our God for this: and he wasintreated of us.   

{8:24} Then I separated twelve of the chief of the priests,Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and ten of their brethren with them, 

{8:25} Andweighed unto them the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, [even] theoffering of the house of our God, which the king, and his counsellors,and his lords, and all Israel [there] present, had offered: 

{8:26} Ieven weighed unto their hand six hundred and fifty talents of silver,and silver vessels an hundred talents, [and] of gold an hundredtalents; 

{8:27} Also twenty basons of gold, of a thousand drams; andtwo vessels of fine copper, precious as gold. 

{8:28} And I said untothem, Ye [are] holy unto the LORD; the vessels [are] holy also; and thesilver and the gold [are] a freewill offering unto the LORD God of yourfathers. 

{8:29} Watch ye, and keep [them,] until ye weigh [them] beforethe chief of the priests and the Levites, and chief of the fathers ofIsrael, at Jerusalem, in the chambers of the house of the LORD. 

{8:30}So took the priests and the Levites the weight of the silver, and thegold, and the vessels, to bring [them] to Jerusalem unto the house ofour God.   

{8:31} Then we departed from the river of Ahava on the twelfth [day]of the first month, to go unto Jerusalem: and the hand of our God wasupon us, and he delivered us from the hand of the enemy, and of such aslay in wait by the way. 

{8:32} And we came to Jerusalem, and abodethere three days.   

{8:33} Now on the fourth day was the silver and the gold and thevessels weighed in the house of our God by the hand of Meremoth the sonof Uriah the priest; and with him [was] Eleazar the son of Phinehas;and with them [was] Jozabad the son of Jeshua, and Noadiah the son ofBinnui, Levites; 

{8:34} By number [and] by weight of every one: and allthe weight was written at that time. 

{8:35} [Also] the children ofthose that had been carried away, which were come out of the captivity,offered burnt offerings unto the God of Israel, twelve bullocks for allIsrael, ninety and six rams, seventy and seven lambs, twelve he goats[for] a sin offering: all [this was] a burnt offering unto the LORD.   

{8:36} And they delivered the king's commissions unto the king'slieutenants, and to the governors on this side the river: and theyfurthered the people, and the house of God.   

{9:1} Now when these things were done, the princes came to me,saying, The people of Israel, and the priests, and the Levites, havenot separated themselves from the people of the lands, [doing]according to their abominations, [even] of the Canaanites, theHittites, the Perizzites, the Jebusites, the Ammonites, the Moabites,the Egyptians, and the Amorites. 

{9:2} For they have taken of theirdaughters for themselves, and for their sons: so that the holy seedhave mingled themselves with the people of [those] lands: yea, the handof the princes and rulers hath been chief in this trespass. 

{9:3} Andwhen I heard this thing, I rent my garment and my mantle, and pluckedoff the hair of my head and of my beard, and sat down astonied. 

{9:4}Then were assembled unto me every one that trembled at the words of theGod of Israel, because of the transgression of those that had beencarried away; and I sat astonied until the evening sacrifice.   

{9:5} And at the evening sacrifice I arose up from my heaviness; andhaving rent my garment and my mantle, I fell upon my knees, and spreadout my hands unto the LORD my God. 

{9:6} And said, O my God, I amashamed and blush to lift up my face to thee, my God: for ouriniquities are increased over [our] head, and our trespass is grown upunto the heavens. 

{9:7} Since the days of our fathers [have] we [been]in a great trespass unto this day; and for our iniquities have we, ourkings, and [our] priests, been delivered into the hand of the kings ofthe lands, to the sword, to captivity, and to a spoil, and to confusionof face, as [it is] this day. 

{9:8} And now for a little space gracehath been [shewed] from the LORD our God, to leave us a remnant toescape, and to give us a nail in his holy place, that our God maylighten our eyes, and give us a little reviving in our bondage. 

{9:9}For we [were] bondmen; yet our God hath not forsaken us in our bondage,but hath extended mercy unto us in the sight of the kings of Persia, togive us a reviving, to set up the house of our God, and to repair thedesolations thereof, and to give us a wall in Judah and in Jerusalem.

{9:10} And now, O our God, what shall we say after this? for we haveforsaken thy commandments, 

{9:11} Which thou hast commanded by thyservants the prophets, saying, The land, unto which ye go to possessit, is an unclean land with the filthiness of the people of the lands,with their abominations, which have filled it from one end to anotherwith their uncleanness. 

{9:12} Now therefore give not your daughtersunto their sons, neither take their daughters unto your sons, nor seektheir peace or their wealth for ever: that ye may be strong, and eatthe good of the land, and leave [it] for an inheritance to yourchildren for ever. 

{9:13} And after all that is come upon us for ourevil deeds, and for our great trespass, seeing that thou our God hastpunished us less than our iniquities [deserve,] and hast given us[such] deliverance as this; 

{9:14} Should we again break thycommandments, and join in affinity with the people of theseabominations? wouldest not thou be angry with us till thou hadstconsumed [us,] so that [there should be] no remnant nor escaping?

{9:15} O LORD God of Israel, thou [art] righteous: for we remain yetescaped, as [it is] this day: behold, we [are] before thee in ourtrespasses: for we cannot stand before thee because of this.   

{10:1} Now when Ezra had prayed, and when he had confessed, weepingand casting himself down before the house of God, there assembled untohim out of Israel a very great congregation of men and women andchildren: for the people wept very sore. 

{10:2} And Shechaniah the sonof Jehiel, [one] of the sons of Elam, answered and said unto Ezra, Wehave trespassed against our God, and have taken strange wives of thepeople of the land: yet now there is hope in Israel concerning thisthing. 

{10:3} Now therefore let us make a covenant with our God to putaway all the wives, and such as are born of them, according to thecounsel of my lord, and of those that tremble at the commandment of ourGod; and let it be done according to the law. 

{10:4} Arise; for [this]matter [belongeth] unto thee: we also [will be] with thee: be of goodcourage, and do [it. ]

{10:5} Then arose Ezra, and made the chiefpriests, the Levites, and all Israel, to swear that they should doaccording to this word. And they sware.   

{10:6} Then Ezra rose up from before the house of God, and went intothe chamber of Johanan the son of Eliashib: and [when] he came thither,he did eat no bread, nor drink water: for he mourned because of thetransgression of them that had been carried away. 

{10:7} And they madeproclamation throughout Judah and Jerusalem unto all the children ofthe captivity, that they should gather themselves together untoJerusalem; 

{10:8} And that whosoever would not come within three days,according to the counsel of the princes and the elders, all hissubstance should be forfeited, and himself separated from thecongregation of those that had been carried away.   

{10:9} Then all the men of Judah and Benjamin gathered themselvestogether unto Jerusalem within three days. It [was] the ninth month, onthe twentieth [day] of the month; and all the people sat in the streetof the house of God, trembling because of [this] matter, and for thegreat rain. 

{10:10} And Ezra the priest stood up, and said unto them,Ye have transgressed, and have taken strange wives, to increase thetrespass of Israel. 

{10:11} Now therefore make confession unto the LORDGod of your fathers, and do his pleasure: and separate yourselves fromthe people of the land, and from the strange wives. 

{10:12} Then allthe congregation answered and said with a loud voice, As thou hastsaid, so must we do. 

{10:13} But the people [are] many, and [it is] atime of much rain, and we are not able to stand without, neither [isthis] a work of one day or two: for we are many that have transgressedin this thing. 

{10:14} Let now our rulers of all the congregationstand, and let all them which have taken strange wives in our citiescome at appointed times, and with them the elders of every city, andthe judges thereof, until the fierce wrath of our God for this matterbe turned from us.   

{10:15} Only Jonathan the son of Asahel and Jahaziah the son ofTikvah were employed about this [matter:] and Meshullam and Shabbethaithe Levite helped them. 

{10:16} And the children of the captivity didso. And Ezra the priest, [with] certain chief of the fathers, after thehouse of their fathers, and all of them by [their] names, wereseparated, and sat down in the first day of the tenth month to examinethe matter. 

{10:17} And they made an end with all the men that hadtaken strange wives by the first day of the first month.   

{10:18} And among the sons of the priests there were found that hadtaken strange wives: [namely,] of the sons of Jeshua the son ofJozadak, and his brethren; Maaseiah, and Eliezer, and Jarib, andGedaliah. 

{10:19} And they gave their hands that they would put awaytheir wives; and [being] guilty, [they offered] a ram of the flock fortheir trespass. 

{10:20} And of the sons of Immer; Hanani, and Zebadiah.

{10:21} And of the sons of Harim; Maaseiah, and Elijah, and Shemaiah,and Jehiel, and Uzziah. 

{10:22} And of the sons of Pashur; Elioenai,Maaseiah, Ishmael, Nethaneel, Jozabad, and Elasah. 

{10:23} Also of theLevites; Jozabad, and Shimei, and Kelaiah, (the same [is] Kelita,)Pethahiah, Judah, and Eliezer. 

{10:24} Of the singers also; Eliashib:and of the porters; Shallum, and Telem, and Uri. 

{10:25} Moreover ofIsrael: of the sons of Parosh; Ramiah, and Jeziah, and Malchiah, andMiamin, and Eleazar, and Malchijah, and Benaiah. 

{10:26} And of thesons of Elam; Mattaniah, Zechariah, and Jehiel, and Abdi, and Jeremoth,and Eliah.

{10:28} Of the sons alsoof Bebai; Jehohanan, Hananiah, Zabbai, [and] Athlai. 

{10:29} And of thesons of Bani; Meshullam, Malluch, and Adaiah, Jashub, and Sheal, andRamoth. 

{10:30} And of the sons of Pahath-moab; Adna, and Chelal,Benaiah, Maaseiah, Mattaniah, Bezaleel, and Binnui, and Manasseh.

{10:31} And [of] the sons of Harim; Eliezer, Ishijah, Malchiah,Shemaiah, Shimeon,
