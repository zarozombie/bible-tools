{The Epistle of Paul to Philemon   

{1:1} Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy our brother,unto Philemon our dearly beloved, and fellowlabourer, 

{1:2} And to[our] beloved Apphia, and Archippus our fellowsoldier, and to thechurch in thy house: 

{1:3} Grace to you, and peace, from God our Fatherand the Lord Jesus Christ.   

{1:4} I thank my God, making mention of thee always in my prayers,

{1:5} Hearing of thy love and faith, which thou hast toward the LordJesus, and toward all saints; 

{1:6} That the communication of thy faithmay become effectual by the acknowledging of every good thing which isin you in Christ Jesus. 

{1:7} For we have great joy and consolation inthy love, because the bowels of the saints are refreshed by thee,brother. 

{1:8} Wherefore, though I might be much bold in Christ toenjoin thee that which is convenient, 

{1:9} Yet for love's sake Irather beseech [thee,] being such an one as Paul the aged, and now alsoa prisoner of Jesus Christ. 

{1:10} I beseech thee for my son Onesimus,whom I have begotten in my bonds: 

{1:11} Which in time past was to theeunprofitable, but now profitable to thee and to me: 

{1:12} Whom I havesent again: thou therefore receive him, that is, mine own bowels:

{1:13} Whom I would have retained with me, that in thy stead he mighthave ministered unto me in the bonds of the gospel: 

{1:14} But withoutthy mind would I do nothing; that thy benefit should not be as it wereof necessity, but willingly. 

{1:15} For perhaps he therefore departedfor a season, that thou shouldest receive him for ever; 

{1:16} Not nowas a servant, but above a servant, a brother beloved, specially to me,but how much more unto thee, both in the flesh, and in the Lord? 

{1:17}If thou count me therefore a partner, receive him as myself. 

{1:18} Ifhe hath wronged thee, or oweth [thee] ought, put that on mine account;

{1:19} I Paul have written [it] with mine own hand, I will repay [it:]albeit I do not say to thee how thou owest unto me even thine own selfbesides. 

{1:20} Yea, brother, let me have joy of thee in the Lord:refresh my bowels in the Lord.   

{1:21} Having confidence in thy obedience I wrote unto thee, knowingthat thou wilt also do more than I say. 

{1:22} But withal prepare mealso a lodging: for I trust that through your prayers I shall be givenunto you.   

{1:23} There salute thee Epaphras, my fellowprisoner in ChristJesus; 

{1:24} Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas, Lucas, my fellowlabourers.   

{1:25} The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ [be] with your spirit.Amen.
