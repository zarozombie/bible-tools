{The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians   

{1:1} Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, to thesaints which are at Ephesus, and to the faithful in Christ Jesus: 

{1:2}Grace [be] to you, and peace, from God our Father, and [from] the LordJesus Christ.   

{1:3} Blessed [be] the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, whohath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly [places] inChrist: 

{1:4} According as he hath chosen us in him before thefoundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blamebefore him in love: 

{1:5} Having predestinated us unto the adoption ofchildren by Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure ofhis will, 

{1:6} To the praise of the glory of his grace, wherein hehath made us accepted in the beloved. 

{1:7} In whom we have redemptionthrough his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches ofhis grace; 

{1:8} Wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom andprudence; 

{1:9} Having made known unto us the mystery of his will,according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself:

{1:10} That in the dispensation of the fulness of times he might gathertogether in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, andwhich are on earth; [even] in him: 

{1:11} In whom also we have obtainedan inheritance, being predestinated according to the purpose of him whoworketh all things after the counsel of his own will: 

{1:12} That weshould be to the praise of his glory, who first trusted in Christ.

{1:13} In whom ye also [trusted,] after that ye heard the word oftruth, the gospel of your salvation: in whom also after that yebelieved, ye were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise, 

{1:14} Whichis the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchasedpossession, unto the praise of his glory.   

{1:15} Wherefore I also, after I heard of your faith in the LordJesus, and love unto all the saints, 

{1:16} Cease not to give thanksfor you, making mention of you in my prayers; 

{1:17} That the God ofour Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give unto you thespirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him: 

{1:18} Theeyes of your understanding being enlightened; that ye may know what isthe hope of his calling, and what the riches of the glory of hisinheritance in the saints, 

{1:19} And what [is] the exceeding greatnessof his power to us-ward who believe, according to the working of hismighty power, 

{1:20} Which he wrought in Christ, when he raised himfrom the dead, and set [him] at his own right hand in the heavenly[places, ]

{1:21} Far above all principality, and power, and might, anddominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, butalso in that which is to come: 

{1:22} And hath put all [things] underhis feet, and gave him [to be] the head over all [things] to thechurch, 

{1:23} Which is his body, the fulness of him that filleth allin all.   

{2:1} And you [hath he quickened,] who were dead in trespasses andsins; 

{2:2} Wherein in time past ye walked according to the course ofthis world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spiritthat now worketh in the children of disobedience: 

{2:3} Among whom alsowe all had our conversation in times past in the lusts of our flesh,fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind; and were by naturethe children of wrath, even as others. 

{2:4} But God, who is rich inmercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us, 

{2:5} Even when wewere dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ, (by grace yeare saved;) 

{2:6} And hath raised [us] up together, and made [us] sittogether in heavenly [places] in Christ Jesus: 

{2:7} That in the agesto come he might shew the exceeding riches of his grace in [his]kindness toward us through Christ Jesus. 

{2:8} For by grace are yesaved through faith; and that not of yourselves: [it is] the gift ofGod: 

{2:9} Not of works, lest any man should boast. 

{2:10} For we arehis workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which Godhath before ordained that we should walk in them.   

{2:11} Wherefore remember, that ye [being] in time past Gentiles inthe flesh, who are called Uncircumcision by that which is called theCircumcision in the flesh made by hands; 

{2:12} That at that time yewere without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, andstrangers from the covenants of promise, having no hope, and withoutGod in the world: 

{2:13} But now in Christ Jesus ye who sometimes werefar off are made nigh by the blood of Christ. 

{2:14} For he is ourpeace, who hath made both one, and hath broken down the middle wall ofpartition [between us; ]

{2:15} Having abolished in his flesh theenmity, [even] the law of commandments [contained] in ordinances; forto make in himself of twain one new man, [so] making peace; 

{2:16} Andthat he might reconcile both unto God in one body by the cross, havingslain the enmity thereby: 

{2:17} And came and preached peace to youwhich were afar off, and to them that were nigh. 

{2:18} For through himwe both have access by one Spirit unto the Father. 

{2:19} Now thereforeye are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellowcitizens with thesaints, and of the household of God; 

{2:20} And are built upon thefoundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being thechief corner [stone; ]

{2:21} In whom all the building fitly framedtogether groweth unto an holy temple in the Lord: 

{2:22} In whom yealso are builded together for an habitation of God through the Spirit.   

{3:1} For this cause I Paul, the prisoner of Jesus Christ for youGentiles, 

{3:2} If ye have heard of the dispensation of the grace ofGod which is given me to youward: 

{3:3} How that by revelation he madeknown unto me the mystery; (as I wrote afore in few words, 

{3:4}Whereby, when ye read, ye may understand my knowledge in the mystery ofChrist) 

{3:5} Which in other ages was not made known unto the sons ofmen, as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by theSpirit; 

{3:6} That the Gentiles should be fellowheirs, and of the samebody, and partakers of his promise in Christ by the gospel: 

{3:7}Whereof I was made a minister, according to the gift of the grace ofGod given unto me by the effectual working of his power. 

{3:8} Unto me,who am less than the least of all saints, is this grace given, that Ishould preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ;

{3:9} And to make all [men] see what [is] the fellowship of themystery, which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God,who created all things by Jesus Christ: 

{3:10} To the intent that nowunto the principalities and powers in heavenly [places] might be knownby the church the manifold wisdom of God, 

{3:11} According to theeternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord: 

{3:12} Inwhom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him.

{3:13} Wherefore I desire that ye faint not at my tribulations for you,which is your glory. 

{3:14} For this cause I bow my knees unto theFather of our Lord Jesus Christ, 

{3:15} Of whom the whole family inheaven and earth is named, 

{3:16} That he would grant you, according tothe riches of his glory, to be strengthened with might by his Spirit inthe inner man; 

{3:17} That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith;that ye, being rooted and grounded in love, 

{3:18} May be able tocomprehend with all saints what [is] the breadth, and length, anddepth, and height; 

{3:19} And to know the love of Christ, which passethknowledge, that ye might be filled with all the fulness of God.   

{3:20} Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly aboveall that we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us,

{3:21} Unto him [be] glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout allages, world without end. Amen.   

{4:1} I therefore, the prisoner of the Lord, beseech you that yewalk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called, 

{4:2} With alllowliness and meekness, with longsuffering, forbearing one another inlove; 

{4:3} Endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond ofpeace. 

{4:4} [There is] one body, and one Spirit, even as ye are calledin one hope of your calling; 

{4:5} One Lord, one faith, one baptism,

{4:6} One God and Father of all, who [is] above all, and through all,and in you all. 

{4:7} But unto every one of us is given grace accordingto the measure of the gift of Christ. 

{4:8} Wherefore he saith, When heascended up on high, he led captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men.

{4:9} (Now that he ascended, what is it but that he also descendedfirst into the lower parts of the earth? 

{4:10} He that descended isthe same also that ascended up far above all heavens, that he mightfill all things.) 

{4:11} And he gave some, apostles; and some,prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers; 

{4:12}For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for theedifying of the body of Christ: 

{4:13} Till we all come in the unity ofthe faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man,unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ: 

{4:14} Thatwe [henceforth] be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carriedabout with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, [and] cunningcraftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive; 

{4:15} But speakingthe truth in love, may grow up into him in all things, which is thehead, [even] Christ: 

{4:16} From whom the whole body fitly joinedtogether and compacted by that which every joint supplieth, accordingto the effectual working in the measure of every part, maketh increaseof the body unto the edifying of itself in love.   

{4:17} This I say therefore, and testify in the Lord, that yehenceforth walk not as other Gentiles walk, in the vanity of theirmind, 

{4:18} Having the understanding darkened, being alienated fromthe life of God through the ignorance that is in them, because of theblindness of their heart: 

{4:19} Who being past feeling have giventhemselves over unto lasciviousness, to work all uncleanness withgreediness. 

{4:20} But ye have not so learned Christ; 

{4:21} If so bethat ye have heard him, and have been taught by him, as the truth is inJesus: 

{4:22} That ye put off concerning the former conversation theold man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts; 

{4:23} Andbe renewed in the spirit of your mind; 

{4:24} And that ye put on thenew man, which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness.   

{4:25} Wherefore putting away lying, speak every man truth with hisneighbour: for we are members one of another. 

{4:26} Be ye angry, andsin not: let not the sun go down upon your wrath: 

{4:27} Neither giveplace to the devil. 

{4:28} Let him that stole steal no more: but ratherlet him labour, working with [his] hands the thing which is good, thathe may have to give to him that needeth. 

{4:29} Let no corruptcommunication proceed out of your mouth, but that which is good to theuse of edifying, that it may minister grace unto the hearers. 

{4:30}And grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto theday of redemption. 

{4:31} Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, andclamour, and evil speaking, be put away from you, with all malice:

{4:32} And be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving oneanother, even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you.   

{5:1} Be ye therefore followers of God, as dear children; 

{5:2} Andwalk in love, as Christ also hath loved us, and hath given himself forus an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweetsmelling savour. 

{5:3}But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not beonce named among you, as becometh saints; 

{5:4} Neither filthiness, norfoolish talking, nor jesting, which are not convenient: but rathergiving of thanks. 

{5:5} For this ye know, that no whoremonger, norunclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, hath anyinheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God. 

{5:6} Let no mandeceive you with vain words: for because of these things cometh thewrath of God upon the children of disobedience. 

{5:7} Be not yetherefore partakers with them. 

{5:8} For ye were sometimes darkness,but now [are ye] light in the Lord: walk as children of light: 

{5:9}(For the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness and righteousness andtruth;) 

{5:10} Proving what is acceptable unto the Lord. 

{5:11} Andhave no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but ratherreprove [them. ]

{5:12} For it is a shame even to speak of those thingswhich are done of them in secret. 

{5:13} But all things that arereproved are made manifest by the light: for whatsoever doth makemanifest is light. 

{5:14} Wherefore he saith, Awake thou that sleepest,and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee light. 

{5:15} Seethen that ye walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise, 

{5:16}Redeeming the time, because the days are evil. 

{5:17} Wherefore be yenot unwise, but understanding what the will of the Lord [is. ]

{5:18}And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with theSpirit; 

{5:19} Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritualsongs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord; 

{5:20}Giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in the nameof our Lord Jesus Christ; 

{5:21} Submitting yourselves one to anotherin the fear of God. 

{5:22} Wives, submit yourselves unto your ownhusbands, as unto the Lord. 

{5:23} For the husband is the head of thewife, even as Christ is the head of the church: and he is the saviourof the body. 

{5:24} Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ, so[let] the wives [be] to their own husbands in every thing. 

{5:25}Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, andgave himself for it; 

{5:26} That he might sanctify and cleanse it withthe washing of water by the word, 

{5:27} That he might present it tohimself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any suchthing; but that it should be holy and without blemish. 

{5:28} So oughtmen to love their wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his wifeloveth himself. 

{5:29} For no man ever yet hated his own flesh; butnourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the Lord the church: 

{5:30} Forwe are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones. 

{5:31} Forthis cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be joinedunto his wife, and they two shall be one flesh. 

{5:32} This is a greatmystery: but I speak concerning Christ and the church. 

{5:33}Nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife evenas himself; and the wife [see] that she reverence [her] husband.   

{6:1} Children, obey your parents in the Lord: for this is right.

{6:2} Honour thy father and mother; (which is the first commandmentwith promise;) 

{6:3} That it may be well with thee, and thou mayestlive long on the earth. 

{6:4} And, ye fathers, provoke not yourchildren to wrath: but bring them up in the nurture and admonition ofthe Lord. 

{6:5} Servants, be obedient to them that are [your] mastersaccording to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in singleness of yourheart, as unto Christ; 

{6:6} Not with eyeservice, as menpleasers; butas the servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart; 

{6:7}With good will doing service, as to the Lord, and not to men: 

{6:8}Knowing that whatsoever good thing any man doeth, the same shall hereceive of the Lord, whether [he be] bond or free. 

{6:9} And, yemasters, do the same things unto them, forbearing threatening: knowingthat your Master also is in heaven; neither is there respect of personswith him.   

{6:10} Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the powerof his might. 

{6:11} Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may beable to stand against the wiles of the devil. 

{6:12} For we wrestle notagainst flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers,against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritualwickedness in high [places. ]

{6:13} Wherefore take unto you the wholearmour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, andhaving done all, to stand. 

{6:14} Stand therefore, having your loinsgirt about with truth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness;

{6:15} And your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace;

{6:16} Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall beable to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked. 

{6:17} And take thehelmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word ofGod: 

{6:18} Praying always with all prayer and supplication in theSpirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplicationfor all saints; 

{6:19} And for me, that utterance may be given unto me,that I may open my mouth boldly, to make known the mystery of thegospel, 

{6:20} For which I am an ambassador in bonds: that therein Imay speak boldly, as I ought to speak.   

{6:21} But that ye also may know my affairs, [and] how I do,Tychicus, a beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord, shallmake known to you all things: 

{6:22} Whom I have sent unto you for thesame purpose, that ye might know our affairs, and [that] he mightcomfort your hearts.   

{6:23} Peace [be] to the brethren, and love with faith, from God theFather and the Lord Jesus Christ. 

{6:24} Grace [be] with all them thatlove our Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity. Amen.
