{The First Epistle General of Peter   

{1:1} Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the strangers scatteredthroughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia, 

{1:2} Electaccording to the foreknowledge of God the Father, throughsanctification of the Spirit, unto obedience and sprinkling of theblood of Jesus Christ: Grace unto you, and peace, be multiplied.   

{1:3} Blessed [be] the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,which according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto alively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, 

{1:4} Toan inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not away,reserved in heaven for you, 

{1:5} Who are kept by the power of Godthrough faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.

{1:6} Wherein ye greatly rejoice, though now for a season, if need be,ye are in heaviness through manifold temptations: 

{1:7} That the trialof your faith, being much more precious than of gold that perisheth,though it be tried with fire, might be found unto praise and honour andglory at the appearing of Jesus Christ: 

{1:8} Whom having not seen, yelove; in whom, though now ye see [him] not, yet believing, ye rejoicewith joy unspeakable and full of glory: 

{1:9} Receiving the end of yourfaith, [even] the salvation of [your] souls. 

{1:10} Of which salvationthe prophets have enquired and searched diligently, who prophesied ofthe grace [that should come] unto you: 

{1:11} Searching what, or whatmanner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did signify, whenit testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ, and the glory thatshould follow. 

{1:12} Unto whom it was revealed, that not untothemselves, but unto us they did minister the things, which are nowreported unto you by them that have preached the gospel unto you withthe Holy Ghost sent down from heaven; which things the angels desire tolook into. 

{1:13} Wherefore gird up the loins of your mind, be sober,and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at therevelation of Jesus Christ; 

{1:14} As obedient children, not fashioningyourselves according to the former lusts in your ignorance: 

{1:15} Butas he which hath called you is holy, so be ye holy in all manner ofconversation; 

{1:16} Because it is written, Be ye holy; for I am holy.

{1:17} And if ye call on the Father, who without respect of personsjudgeth according to every man's work, pass the time of your sojourning[here] in fear: 

{1:18} Forasmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemedwith corruptible things, [as] silver and gold, from your vainconversation [received] by tradition from your fathers; 

{1:19} But withthe precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and withoutspot: 

{1:20} Who verily was foreordained before the foundation of theworld, but was manifest in these last times for you, 

{1:21} Who by himdo believe in God, that raised him up from the dead, and gave himglory; that your faith and hope might be in God. 

{1:22} Seeing ye havepurified your souls in obeying the truth through the Spirit untounfeigned love of the brethren, [see that ye] love one another with apure heart fervently: 

{1:23} Being born again, not of corruptible seed,but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth forever. 

{1:24} For all flesh [is] as grass, and all the glory of man asthe flower of grass. The grass withereth, and the flower thereoffalleth away: 

{1:25} But the word of the Lord endureth for ever. Andthis is the word which by the gospel is preached unto you.   

{2:1} Wherefore laying aside all malice, and all guile, andhypocrisies, and envies, and all evil speakings, 

{2:2} As newbornbabes, desire the sincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby:

{2:3} If so be ye have tasted that the Lord [is] gracious. 

{2:4} Towhom coming, [as unto] a living stone, disallowed indeed of men, butchosen of God, [and] precious, 

{2:5} Ye also, as lively stones, arebuilt up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood, to offer up spiritualsacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ. 

{2:6} Wherefore also itis contained in the scripture, Behold, I lay in Sion a chief cornerstone, elect, precious: and he that believeth on him shall not beconfounded. 

{2:7} Unto you therefore which believe [he is] precious:but unto them which be disobedient, the stone which the buildersdisallowed, the same is made the head of the corner, 

{2:8} And a stoneof stumbling, and a rock of offence, [even to them] which stumble atthe word, being disobedient: whereunto also they were appointed. 

{2:9}But ye [are] a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, apeculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hathcalled you out of darkness into his marvellous light: 

{2:10} Which intime past [were] not a people, but [are] now the people of God: whichhad not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy.   

{2:11} Dearly beloved, I beseech [you] as strangers and pilgrims,abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul; 

{2:12} Havingyour conversation honest among the Gentiles: that, whereas they speakagainst you as evildoers, they may by [your] good works, which theyshall behold, glorify God in the day of visitation.   

{2:13} Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord'ssake: whether it be to the king, as supreme; 

{2:14} Or unto governors,as unto them that are sent by him for the punishment of evildoers, andfor the praise of them that do well. 

{2:15} For so is the will of God,that with well doing ye may put to silence the ignorance of foolishmen: 

{2:16} As free, and not using [your] liberty for a cloke ofmaliciousness, but as the servants of God. 

{2:17} Honour all [men.]Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honour the king. 

{2:18} Servants, [be]subject to [your] masters with all fear; not only to the good andgentle, but also to the froward. 

{2:19} For this [is] thankworthy, if aman for conscience toward God endure grief, suffering wrongfully.

{2:20} For what glory [is it,] if, when ye be buffeted for your faults,ye shall take it patiently? but if, when ye do well, and suffer [forit,] ye take it patiently, this [is] acceptable with God. 

{2:21} Foreven hereunto were ye called: because Christ also suffered for us,leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps: 

{2:22} Who didno sin, neither was guile found in his mouth: 

{2:23} Who, when he wasreviled, reviled not again; when he suffered, he threatened not; butcommitted [himself] to him that judgeth righteously: 

{2:24} Who his ownself bare our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead tosins, should live unto righteousness: by whose stripes ye were healed.

{2:25} For ye were as sheep going astray; but are now returned unto theShepherd and Bishop of your souls.   

{3:1} Likewise, ye wives, [be] in subjection to your own husbands;that, if any obey not the word, they also may without the word be wonby the conversation of the wives; 

{3:2} While they behold your chasteconversation [coupled] with fear. 

{3:3} Whose adorning let it not bethat outward [adorning] of plaiting the hair, and of wearing of gold,or of putting on of apparel; 

{3:4} But [let it be] the hidden man ofthe heart, in that which is not corruptible, [even the ornament] of ameek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price.

{3:5} For after this manner in the old time the holy women also, whotrusted in God, adorned themselves, being in subjection unto their ownhusbands: 

{3:6} Even as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord: whosedaughters ye are, as long as ye do well, and are not afraid with anyamazement. 

{3:7} Likewise, ye husbands, dwell with [them] according toknowledge, giving honour unto the wife, as unto the weaker vessel, andas being heirs together of the grace of life; that your prayers be nothindered. 

{3:8} Finally, [be ye] all of one mind, having compassion oneof another, love as brethren, [be] pitiful, [be] courteous: 

{3:9} Notrendering evil for evil, or railing for railing: but contrariwiseblessing; knowing that ye are thereunto called, that ye should inherita blessing. 

{3:10} For he that will love life, and see good days, lethim refrain his tongue from evil, and his lips that they speak noguile: 

{3:11} Let him eschew evil, and do good; let him seek peace, andensue it. 

{3:12} For the eyes of the Lord [are] over the righteous, andhis ears [are open] unto their prayers: but the face of the Lord [is]against them that do evil.   

{3:13} And who [is] he that will harm you, if ye be followers ofthat which is good? 

{3:14} But and if ye suffer for righteousness'sake, happy [are ye:] and be not afraid of their terror, neither betroubled; 

{3:15} But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts: and [be]ready always to [give] an answer to every man that asketh you a reasonof the hope that is in you with meekness and fear: 

{3:16} Having a goodconscience; that, whereas they speak evil of you, as of evildoers, theymay be ashamed that falsely accuse your good conversation in Christ.

{3:17} For [it is] better, if the will of God be so, that ye suffer forwell doing, than for evil doing. 

{3:18} For Christ also hath oncesuffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us toGod, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit:

{3:19} By which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison;

{3:20} Which sometime were disobedient, when once the longsuffering ofGod waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was a preparing, whereinfew, that is, eight souls were saved by water. 

{3:21} The like figurewhereunto [even] baptism doth also now save us (not the putting away ofthe filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience towardGod,) by the resurrection of Jesus Christ: 

{3:22} Who is gone intoheaven, and is on the right hand of God; angels and authorities andpowers being made subject unto him.   

{4:1} Forasmuch then as Christ hath suffered for us in the flesh,arm yourselves likewise with the same mind: for he that hath sufferedin the flesh hath ceased from sin; 

{4:2} That he no longer should livethe rest of [his] time in the flesh to the lusts of men, but to thewill of God. 

{4:3} For the time past of [our] life may suffice us tohave wrought the will of the Gentiles, when we walked inlasciviousness, lusts, excess of wine, revellings, banquetings, andabominable idolatries: 

{4:4} Wherein they think it strange that ye runnot with [them] to the same excess of riot, speaking evil of [you:]

{4:5} Who shall give account to him that is ready to judge the quickand the dead. 

{4:6} For for this cause was the gospel preached also tothem that are dead, that they might be judged according to men in theflesh, but live according to God in the spirit.   

{4:7} But the end of all things is at hand: be ye therefore sober,and watch unto prayer. 

{4:8} And above all things have fervent charityamong yourselves: for charity shall cover the multitude of sins. 

{4:9}Use hospitality one to another without grudging. 

{4:10} As every manhath received the gift, [even so] minister the same one to another, asgood stewards of the manifold grace of God. 

{4:11} If any man speak,[let him speak] as the oracles of God; if any man minister, [let him doit] as of the ability which God giveth: that God in all things may beglorified through Jesus Christ, to whom be praise and dominion for everand ever. Amen.   

{4:12} Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trialwhich is to try you, as though some strange thing happened unto you:

{4:13} But rejoice, inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ'ssufferings; that, when his glory shall be revealed, ye may be glad alsowith exceeding joy. 

{4:14} If ye be reproached for the name of Christ,happy [are ye;] for the spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you: ontheir part he is evil spoken of, but on your part he is glorified.

{4:15} But let none of you suffer as a murderer, or [as] a thief, or[as] an evildoer, or as a busybody in other men's matters. 

{4:16} Yetif [any man suffer] as a Christian, let him not be ashamed; but let himglorify God on this behalf. 

{4:17} For the time [is come] that judgmentmust begin at the house of God: and if [it] first [begin] at us, whatshall the end [be] of them that obey not the gospel of God? 

{4:18} Andif the righteous scarcely be saved, where shall the ungodly and thesinner appear? 

{4:19} Wherefore let them that suffer according to thewill of God commit the keeping of their souls [to him] in well doing,as unto a faithful Creator.   

{5:1} The elders which are among you I exhort, who am also an elder,and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and also a partaker of theglory that shall be revealed: 

{5:2} Feed the flock of God which isamong you, taking the oversight [thereof,] not by constraint, butwillingly; not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind; 

{5:3} Neither asbeing lords over [God's] heritage, but being ensamples to the flock.

{5:4} And when the chief Shepherd shall appear, ye shall receive acrown of glory that fadeth not away. 

{5:5} Likewise, ye younger, submityourselves unto the elder. Yea, all [of you] be subject one to another,and be clothed with humility: for God resisteth the proud, and givethgrace to the humble.   

{5:6} Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, thathe may exalt you in due time: 

{5:7} Casting all your care upon him; forhe careth for you. 

{5:8} Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversarythe devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he maydevour: 

{5:9} Whom resist stedfast in the faith, knowing that the sameafflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world.

{5:10} But the God of all grace, who hath called us unto his eternalglory by Christ Jesus, after that ye have suffered a while, make youperfect, stablish, strengthen, settle [you. ]

{5:11} To him [be] gloryand dominion for ever and ever. Amen.   

{5:12} By Silvanus, a faithful brother unto you, as I suppose, Ihave written briefly, exhorting, and testifying that this is the truegrace of God wherein ye stand. 

{5:13} The [church that is] at Babylon,elected together with [you,] saluteth you; and [so doth] Marcus my son.

{5:14} Greet ye one another with a kiss of charity. Peace [be] with youall that are in Christ Jesus. Amen.
