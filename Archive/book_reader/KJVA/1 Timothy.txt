{The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy   

{1:1} Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the commandment of God ourSaviour, and Lord Jesus Christ, [which is] our hope; 

{1:2} UntoTimothy, [my] own son in the faith: Grace, mercy, [and] peace, from Godour Father and Jesus Christ our Lord.   

{1:3} As I besought thee to abide still at Ephesus, when I went intoMacedonia, that thou mightest charge some that they teach no otherdoctrine, 

{1:4} Neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies,which minister questions, rather than godly edifying which is in faith:[so do. ]

{1:5} Now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pureheart, and [of] a good conscience, and [of] faith unfeigned: 

{1:6} Fromwhich some having swerved have turned aside unto vain jangling; 

{1:7}Desiring to be teachers of the law; understanding neither what theysay, nor whereof they affirm. 

{1:8} But we know that the law [is] good,if a man use it lawfully; 

{1:9} Knowing this, that the law is not madefor a righteous man, but for the lawless and disobedient, for theungodly and for sinners, for unholy and profane, for murderers offathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers, 

{1:10} Forwhoremongers, for them that defile themselves with mankind, formenstealers, for liars, for perjured persons, and if there be any otherthing that is contrary to sound doctrine; 

{1:11} According to theglorious gospel of the blessed God, which was committed to my trust.

{1:12} And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who hath enabled me, for thathe counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry; 

{1:13} Who wasbefore a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and injurious: but I obtainedmercy, because I did [it] ignorantly in unbelief. 

{1:14} And the graceof our Lord was exceeding abundant with faith and love which is inChrist Jesus. 

{1:15} This [is] a faithful saying, and worthy of allacceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; ofwhom I am chief. 

{1:16} Howbeit for this cause I obtained mercy, thatin me first Jesus Christ might shew forth all longsuffering, for apattern to them which should hereafter believe on him to lifeeverlasting. 

{1:17} Now unto the King eternal, immortal, invisible, theonly wise God, [be] honour and glory for ever and ever. Amen. 

{1:18}This charge I commit unto thee, son Timothy, according to theprophecies which went before on thee, that thou by them mightest war agood warfare; 

{1:19} Holding faith, and a good conscience; which somehaving put away concerning faith have made shipwreck: 

{1:20} Of whom isHymenaeus and Alexander; whom I have delivered unto Satan, that theymay learn not to blaspheme.   

{2:1} I exhort therefore, that, first of all, supplications,prayers, intercessions, [and] giving of thanks, be made for all men;

{2:2} For kings, and [for] all that are in authority; that we may leada quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty. 

{2:3} For this[is] good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour; 

{2:4} Whowill have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of thetruth. 

{2:5} For [there is] one God, and one mediator between God andmen, the man Christ Jesus; 

{2:6} Who gave himself a ransom for all, tobe testified in due time. 

{2:7} Whereunto I am ordained a preacher, andan apostle, (I speak the truth in Christ, [and] lie not;) a teacher ofthe Gentiles in faith and verity. 

{2:8} I will therefore that men prayevery where, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting. 

{2:9}In like manner also, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel,with shamefacedness and sobriety; not with broided hair, or gold, orpearls, or costly array; 

{2:10} But (which becometh women professinggodliness) with good works. 

{2:11} Let the woman learn in silence withall subjection. 

{2:12} But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurpauthority over the man, but to be in silence. 

{2:13} For Adam was firstformed, then Eve. 

{2:14} And Adam was not deceived, but the woman beingdeceived was in the transgression. 

{2:15} Notwithstanding she shall besaved in childbearing, if they continue in faith and charity andholiness with sobriety.   

{3:1} This [is] a true saying, If a man desire the office of abishop, he desireth a good work. 

{3:2} A bishop then must be blameless,the husband of one wife, vigilant, sober, of good behaviour, given tohospitality, apt to teach; 

{3:3} Not given to wine, no striker, notgreedy of filthy lucre; but patient, not a brawler, not covetous; 

{3:4}One that ruleth well his own house, having his children in subjectionwith all gravity; 

{3:5} (For if a man know not how to rule his ownhouse, how shall he take care of the church of God?) 

{3:6} Not anovice, lest being lifted up with pride he fall into the condemnationof the devil. 

{3:7} Moreover he must have a good report of them whichare without; lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil.

{3:8} Likewise [must] the deacons [be] grave, not doubletongued, notgiven to much wine, not greedy of filthy lucre; 

{3:9} Holding themystery of the faith in a pure conscience. 

{3:10} And let these alsofirst be proved; then let them use the office of a deacon, being[found] blameless. 

{3:11} Even so [must their] wives be grave, notslanderers, sober, faithful in all things. 

{3:12} Let the deacons bethe husbands of one wife, ruling their children and their own houseswell. 

{3:13} For they that have used the office of a deacon wellpurchase to themselves a good degree, and great boldness in the faithwhich is in Christ Jesus. 

{3:14} These things write I unto thee, hopingto come unto thee shortly: 

{3:15} But if I tarry long, that thou mayestknow how thou oughtest to behave thyself in the house of God, which isthe church of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth.

{3:16} And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: Godwas manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels,preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up intoglory.   

{4:1} Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter timessome shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, anddoctrines of devils; 

{4:2} Speaking lies in hypocrisy; having theirconscience seared with a hot iron; 

{4:3} Forbidding to marry, [andcommanding] to abstain from meats, which God hath created to bereceived with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth.

{4:4} For every creature of God [is] good, and nothing to be refused,if it be received with thanksgiving: 

{4:5} For it is sanctified by theword of God and prayer. 

{4:6} If thou put the brethren in remembranceof these things, thou shalt be a good minister of Jesus Christ,nourished up in the words of faith and of good doctrine, whereunto thouhast attained. 

{4:7} But refuse profane and old wives' fables, andexercise thyself [rather] unto godliness. 

{4:8} For bodily exerciseprofiteth little: but godliness is profitable unto all things, havingpromise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come. 

{4:9}This [is] a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation. 

{4:10} Fortherefore we both labour and suffer reproach, because we trust in theliving God, who is the Saviour of all men, specially of those thatbelieve.   

{4:11} These things command and teach. 

{4:12} Let no man despise thyyouth; but be thou an example of the believers, in word, inconversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity. 

{4:13} Till Icome, give attendance to reading, to exhortation, to doctrine. 

{4:14}Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee by prophecy,with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery. 

{4:15} Meditate uponthese things; give thyself wholly to them; that thy profiting mayappear to all. 

{4:16} Take heed unto thyself, and unto the doctrine;continue in them: for in doing this thou shalt both save thyself, andthem that hear thee.   

{5:1} Rebuke not an elder, but intreat [him] as a father; [and] theyounger men as brethren; 

{5:2} The elder women as mothers; the youngeras sisters, with all purity. 

{5:3} Honour widows that are widowsindeed. 

{5:4} But if any widow have children or nephews, let them learnfirst to shew piety at home, and to requite their parents: for that isgood and acceptable before God. 

{5:5} Now she that is a widow indeed,and desolate, trusteth in God, and continueth in supplications andprayers night and day. 

{5:6} But she that liveth in pleasure is deadwhile she liveth. 

{5:7} And these things give in charge, that they maybe blameless. 

{5:8} But if any provide not for his own, and speciallyfor those of his own house, he hath denied the faith, and is worse thanan infidel. 

{5:9} Let not a widow be taken into the number underthreescore years old, having been the wife of one man, 

{5:10} Wellreported of for good works; if she have brought up children, if shehave lodged strangers, if she have washed the saints' feet, if she haverelieved the afflicted, if she have diligently followed every goodwork. 

{5:11} But the younger widows refuse: for when they have begun towax wanton against Christ, they will marry; 

{5:12} Having damnation,because they have cast off their first faith. 

{5:13} And withal theylearn [to be] idle, wandering about from house to house; and not onlyidle, but tattlers also and busybodies, speaking things which theyought not. 

{5:14} I will therefore that the younger women marry, bearchildren, guide the house, give none occasion to the adversary to speakreproachfully. 

{5:15} For some are already turned aside after Satan.

{5:16} If any man or woman that believeth have widows, let them relievethem, and let not the church be charged; that it may relieve them thatare widows indeed. 

{5:17} Let the elders that rule well be countedworthy of double honour, especially they who labour in the word anddoctrine. 

{5:18} For the scripture saith, Thou shalt not muzzle the oxthat treadeth out the corn. And, The labourer [is] worthy of hisreward. 

{5:19} Against an elder receive not an accusation, but beforetwo or three witnesses. 

{5:20} Them that sin rebuke before all, thatothers also may fear. 

{5:21} I charge [thee] before God, and the LordJesus Christ, and the elect angels, that thou observe these thingswithout preferring one before another, doing nothing by partiality.

{5:22} Lay hands suddenly on no man, neither be partaker of other men'ssins: keep thyself pure. 

{5:23} Drink no longer water, but use a littlewine for thy stomach's sake and thine often infirmities. 

{5:24} Somemen's sins are open beforehand, going before to judgment; and some[men] they follow after. 

{5:25} Likewise also the good works [of some]are manifest beforehand; and they that are otherwise cannot be hid.   

{6:1} Let as many servants as are under the yoke count their ownmasters worthy of all honour, that the name of God and [his] doctrinebe not blasphemed. 

{6:2} And they that have believing masters, let themnot despise [them,] because they are brethren; but rather do [them]service, because they are faithful and beloved, partakers of thebenefit. These things teach and exhort.   

{6:3} If any man teach otherwise, and consent not to wholesomewords, [even] the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the doctrinewhich is according to godliness; 

{6:4} He is proud, knowing nothing,but doting about questions and strifes of words, whereof cometh envy,strife, railings, evil surmisings, 

{6:5} Perverse disputings of men ofcorrupt minds, and destitute of the truth, supposing that gain isgodliness: from such withdraw thyself. 

{6:6} But godliness withcontentment is great gain. 

{6:7} For we brought nothing into [this]world, [and it is] certain we can carry nothing out. 

{6:8} And havingfood and raiment let us be therewith content. 

{6:9} But they that willbe rich fall into temptation and a snare, and [into] many foolish andhurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction and perdition. 

{6:10} Forthe love of money is the root of all evil: which while some covetedafter, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves throughwith many sorrows. 

{6:11} But thou, O man of God, flee these things;and follow after righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience,meekness. 

{6:12} Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternallife, whereunto thou art also called, and hast professed a goodprofession before many witnesses. 

{6:13} I give thee charge in thesight of God, who quickeneth all things, and [before] Christ Jesus, whobefore Pontius Pilate witnessed a good confession; 

{6:14} That thoukeep [this] commandment without spot, unrebukeable, until the appearingof our Lord Jesus Christ: 

{6:15} Which in his times he shall shew, [whois] the blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings, and Lord oflords; 

{6:16} Who only hath immortality, dwelling in the light which noman can approach unto; whom no man hath seen, nor can see: to whom [be]honour and power everlasting. Amen. 

{6:17} Charge them that are rich inthis world, that they be not highminded, nor trust in uncertain riches,but in the living God, who giveth us richly all things to enjoy; 

{6:18}That they do good, that they be rich in good works, ready todistribute, willing to communicate; 

{6:19} Laying up in store forthemselves a good foundation against the time to come, that they maylay hold on eternal life. 

{6:20} O Timothy, keep that which iscommitted to thy trust, avoiding profane [and] vain babblings, andoppositions of science falsely so called: 

{6:21} Which some professinghave erred concerning the faith. Grace [be] with thee. Amen.
