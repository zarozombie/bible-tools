{Malachi   

{1:1} The burden of the word of the LORD to Israel by Malachi. 

{1:2}I have loved you, saith the LORD. Yet ye say, Wherein hast thou lovedus? [Was] not Esau Jacob's brother? saith the LORD: yet I loved Jacob,

{1:3} And I hated Esau, and laid his mountains and his heritage wastefor the dragons of the wilderness. 

{1:4} Whereas Edom saith, We areimpoverished, but we will return and build the desolate places; thussaith the LORD of hosts, They shall build, but I will throw down; andthey shall call them, The border of wickedness, and, The people againstwhom the LORD hath indignation for ever. 

{1:5} And your eyes shall see,and ye shall say, The LORD will be magnified from the border of Israel.   

{1:6} A son honoureth [his] father, and a servant his master: ifthen I [be] a father, where [is] mine honour? and if I [be] a master,where [is] my fear? saith the LORD of hosts unto you, O priests, thatdespise my name. And ye say, Wherein have we despised thy name? 

{1:7}Ye offer polluted bread upon mine altar; and ye say, Wherein have wepolluted thee? In that ye say, The table of the LORD [is] contemptible.

{1:8} And if ye offer the blind for sacrifice, [is it] not evil? and ifye offer the lame and sick, [is it] not evil? offer it now unto thygovernor; will he be pleased with thee, or accept thy person? saith theLORD of hosts. 

{1:9} And now, I pray you, beseech God that he will begracious unto us: this hath been by your means: will he regard yourpersons? saith the LORD of hosts. 

{1:10} Who [is there] even among youthat would shut the doors [for nought?] neither do ye kindle [fire] onmine altar for nought. I have no pleasure in you, saith the LORD ofhosts, neither will I accept an offering at your hand. 

{1:11} For fromthe rising of the sun even unto the going down of the same my name[shall be] great among the Gentiles; and in every place incense [shallbe] offered unto my name, and a pure offering: for my name [shall be]great among the heathen, saith the LORD of hosts.   

{1:12} But ye have profaned it, in that ye say, The table of theLORD [is] polluted; and the fruit thereof, [even] his meat, [is]contemptible. 

{1:13} Ye said also, Behold, what a weariness [is it!]and ye have snuffed at it, saith the LORD of hosts; and ye brought[that which was] torn, and the lame, and the sick; thus ye brought anoffering: should I accept this of your hand? saith the LORD. 

{1:14} Butcursed [be] the deceiver, which hath in his flock a male, and voweth,and sacrificeth unto the LORD a corrupt thing: for I [am] a great King,saith the LORD of hosts, and my name [is] dreadful among the heathen.   

{2:1} And now, O ye priests, this commandment [is] for you. 

{2:2} Ifye will not hear, and if ye will not lay [it] to heart, to give gloryunto my name, saith the LORD of hosts, I will even send a curse uponyou, and I will curse your blessings: yea, I have cursed them already,because ye do not lay [it] to heart. 

{2:3} Behold, I will corrupt yourseed, and spread dung upon your faces, [even] the dung of your solemnfeasts; and [one] shall take you away with it. 

{2:4} And ye shall knowthat I have sent this commandment unto you, that my covenant might bewith Levi, saith the LORD of hosts. 

{2:5} My covenant was with him oflife and peace; and I gave them to him [for] the fear wherewith hefeared me, and was afraid before my name. 

{2:6} The law of truth was inhis mouth, and iniquity was not found in his lips: he walked with me inpeace and equity, and did turn many away from iniquity. 

{2:7} For thepriest's lips should keep knowledge, and they should seek the law athis mouth: for he [is] the messenger of the LORD of hosts. 

{2:8} But yeare departed out of the way; ye have caused many to stumble at the law;ye have corrupted the covenant of Levi, saith the LORD of hosts. 

{2:9}Therefore have I also made you contemptible and base before all thepeople, according as ye have not kept my ways, but have been partial inthe law. 

{2:10} Have we not all one father? hath not one God createdus? why do we deal treacherously every man against his brother, byprofaning the covenant of our fathers?   

{2:11} Judah hath dealt treacherously, and an abomination iscommitted in Israel and in Jerusalem; for Judah hath profaned theholiness of the LORD which he loved, and hath married the daughter of astrange god. 

{2:12} The LORD will cut off the man that doeth this, themaster and the scholar, out of the tabernacles of Jacob, and him thatoffereth an offering unto the LORD of hosts. 

{2:13} And this have yedone again, covering the altar of the LORD with tears, with weeping,and with crying out, insomuch that he regardeth not the offering anymore, or receiveth [it] with good will at your hand.   

{2:14} Yet ye say, Wherefore? Because the LORD hath been witnessbetween thee and the wife of thy youth, against whom thou hast dealttreacherously: yet [is] she thy companion, and the wife of thycovenant. 

{2:15} And did not he make one? Yet had he the residue of thespirit. And wherefore one? That he might seek a godly seed. Thereforetake heed to your spirit, and let none deal treacherously against thewife of his youth. 

{2:16} For the LORD, the God of Israel, saith thathe hateth putting away: for [one] covereth violence with his garment,saith the LORD of hosts: therefore take heed to your spirit, that yedeal not treacherously.   

{2:17} Ye have wearied the LORD with your words. Yet ye say, Whereinhave we wearied [him?] When ye say, Every one that doeth evil [is] goodin the sight of the LORD, and he delighteth in them; or, Where [is] theGod of judgment?   

{3:1} Behold, I will send my messenger, and he shall prepare the waybefore me: and the Lord, whom ye seek, shall suddenly come to histemple, even the messenger of the covenant, whom ye delight in: behold,he shall come, saith the LORD of hosts. 

{3:2} But who may abide the dayof his coming? and who shall stand when he appeareth? for he [is] likea refiner's fire, and like fullers' sope: 

{3:3} And he shall sit [as] arefiner and purifier of silver: and he shall purify the sons of Levi,and purge them as gold and silver, that they may offer unto the LORD anoffering in righteousness. 

{3:4} Then shall the offering of Judah andJerusalem be pleasant unto the LORD, as in the days of old, and as informer years. 

{3:5} And I will come near to you to judgment; and I willbe a swift witness against the sorcerers, and against the adulterers,and against false swearers, and against those that oppress the hirelingin [his] wages, the widow, and the fatherless, and that turn aside thestranger [from his right,] and fear not me, saith the LORD of hosts.

{3:6} For I [am] the LORD, I change not; therefore ye sons of Jacob arenot consumed.   

{3:7} Even from the days of your fathers ye are gone away from mineordinances, and have not kept [them.] Return unto me, and I will returnunto you, saith the LORD of hosts. But ye said, Wherein shall we return?   

{3:8} Will a man rob God? Yet ye have robbed me. But ye say, Whereinhave we robbed thee? In tithes and offerings. 

{3:9} Ye [are] cursedwith a curse: for ye have robbed me, [even] this whole nation. 

{3:10}Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be meat inmine house, and prove me now herewith, saith the LORD of hosts, if Iwill not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing,that [there shall] not [be room] enough [to receive it. ]

{3:11} And Iwill rebuke the devourer for your sakes, and he shall not destroy thefruits of your ground; neither shall your vine cast her fruit beforethe time in the field, saith the LORD of hosts. 

{3:12} And all nationsshall call you blessed: for ye shall be a delightsome land, saith theLORD of hosts.   

{3:13} Your words have been stout against me, saith the LORD. Yet yesay, What have we spoken [so much] against thee? 

{3:14} Ye have said,It [is] vain to serve God: and what profit [is it] that we have kepthis ordinance, and that we have walked mournfully before the LORD ofhosts? 

{3:15} And now we call the proud happy; yea, they that workwickedness are set up; yea, [they that] tempt God are even delivered.   

{3:16} Then they that feared the LORD spake often one to another:and the LORD hearkened, and heard [it,] and a book of remembrance waswritten before him for them that feared the LORD, and that thought uponhis name. 

{3:17} And they shall be mine, saith the LORD of hosts, inthat day when I make up my jewels; and I will spare them, as a manspareth his own son that serveth him. 

{3:18} Then shall ye return, anddiscern between the righteous and the wicked, between him that servethGod and him that serveth him not.   

{4:1} For, behold, the day cometh, that shall burn as an oven; andall the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly, shall be stubble: and theday that cometh shall burn them up, saith the LORD of hosts, that itshall leave them neither root nor branch.   

{4:2} But unto you that fear my name shall the Sun of righteousnessarise with healing in his wings; and ye shall go forth, and grow up ascalves of the stall. 

{4:3} And ye shall tread down the wicked; for theyshall be ashes under the soles of your feet in the day that I shall do[this,] saith the LORD of hosts.   

{4:4} Remember ye the law of Moses my servant, which I commandedunto him in Horeb for all Israel, [with] the statutes and judgments.   

{4:5} Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the comingof the great and dreadful day of the LORD: 

{4:6} And he shall turn theheart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children totheir fathers, lest I come and smite the earth with a curse.
