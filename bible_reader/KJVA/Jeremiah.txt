{The Book of the Prophet Jeremiah   

{1:1} The words of Jeremiah the son of Hilkiah, of the priests that[were] in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin: 

{1:2} To whom the word ofthe LORD came in the days of Josiah the son of Amon king of Judah, inthe thirteenth year of his reign. 

{1:3} It came also in the days ofJehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, unto the end of the eleventhyear of Zedekiah the son of Josiah king of Judah, unto the carryingaway of Jerusalem captive in the fifth month. 

{1:4} Then the word ofthe LORD came unto me, saying, 

{1:5} Before I formed thee in the bellyI knew thee; and before thou camest forth out of the womb I sanctifiedthee, [and] I ordained thee a prophet unto the nations. 

{1:6} Then saidI, Ah, Lord GOD! behold, I cannot speak: for I [am] a child.   

{1:7} But the LORD said unto me, Say not, I [am] a child: for thoushalt go to all that I shall send thee, and whatsoever I command theethou shalt speak. 

{1:8} Be not afraid of their faces: for I [am] withthee to deliver thee, saith the LORD. 

{1:9} Then the LORD put forth hishand, and touched my mouth. And the LORD said unto me, Behold, I haveput my words in thy mouth. 

{1:10} See, I have this day set thee overthe nations and over the kingdoms, to root out, and to pull down, andto destroy, and to throw down, to build, and to plant.   

{1:11} Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, Jeremiah,what seest thou? And I said, I see a rod of an almond tree. 

{1:12} Thensaid the LORD unto me, Thou hast well seen: for I will hasten my wordto perform it. 

{1:13} And the word of the LORD came unto me the secondtime, saying, What seest thou? And I said, I see a seething pot; andthe face thereof [is] toward the north. 

{1:14} Then the LORD said untome, Out of the north an evil shall break forth upon all the inhabitantsof the land. 

{1:15} For, lo, I will call all the families of thekingdoms of the north, saith the LORD; and they shall come, and theyshall set every one his throne at the entering of the gates ofJerusalem, and against all the walls thereof round about, and againstall the cities of Judah. 

{1:16} And I will utter my judgments againstthem touching all their wickedness, who have forsaken me, and haveburned incense unto other gods, and worshipped the works of their ownhands.   

{1:17} Thou therefore gird up thy loins, and arise, and speak untothem all that I command thee: be not dismayed at their faces, lest Iconfound thee before them. 

{1:18} For, behold, I have made thee thisday a defenced city, and an iron pillar, and brasen walls against thewhole land, against the kings of Judah, against the princes thereof,against the priests thereof, and against the people of the land. 

{1:19}And they shall fight against thee; but they shall not prevail againstthee; for I [am] with thee, saith the LORD, to deliver thee.   

{2:1} Moreover the word of the LORD came to me, saying, 

{2:2} Go andcry in the ears of Jerusalem, saying, Thus saith the LORD; I rememberthee, the kindness of thy youth, the love of thine espousals, when thouwentest after me in the wilderness, in a land [that was] not sown.

{2:3} Israel [was] holiness unto the LORD, [and] the firstfruits of hisincrease: all that devour him shall offend; evil shall come upon them,saith the LORD. 

{2:4} Hear ye the word of the LORD, O house of Jacob,and all the families of the house of Israel:   

{2:5} Thus saith the LORD, What iniquity have your fathers found inme, that they are gone far from me, and have walked after vanity, andare become vain? 

{2:6} Neither said they, Where [is] the LORD thatbrought us up out of the land of Egypt, that led us through thewilderness, through a land of deserts and of pits, through a land ofdrought, and of the shadow of death, through a land that no man passedthrough, and where no man dwelt? 

{2:7} And I brought you into aplentiful country, to eat the fruit thereof and the goodness thereof;but when ye entered, ye defiled my land, and made mine heritage anabomination. 

{2:8} The priests said not, Where [is] the LORD? and theythat handle the law knew me not: the pastors also transgressed againstme, and the prophets prophesied by Baal, and walked after [things that]do not profit.   

{2:9} Wherefore I will yet plead with you, saith the LORD, and withyour children's children will I plead. 

{2:10} For pass over the islesof Chittim, and see; and send unto Kedar, and consider diligently, andsee if there be such a thing. 

{2:11} Hath a nation changed [their]gods, which [are] yet no gods? but my people have changed their gloryfor [that which] doth not profit. 

{2:12} Be astonished, O ye heavens,at this, and be horribly afraid, be ye very desolate, saith the LORD.

{2:13} For my people have committed two evils; they have forsaken methe fountain of living waters, [and] hewed them out cisterns, brokencisterns, that can hold no water.   

{2:14} [Is] Israel a servant? [is] he a homeborn [slave?] why is hespoiled? 

{2:15} The young lions roared upon him, [and] yelled, and theymade his land waste: his cities are burned without inhabitant. 

{2:16}Also the children of Noph and Tahapanes have broken the crown of thyhead. 

{2:17} Hast thou not procured this unto thyself, in that thouhast forsaken the LORD thy God, when he led thee by the way? 

{2:18} Andnow what hast thou to do in the way of Egypt, to drink the waters ofSihor? or what hast thou to do in the way of Assyria, to drink thewaters of the river? 

{2:19} Thine own wickedness shall correct thee,and thy backslidings shall reprove thee: know therefore and see that[it is] an evil [thing] and bitter, that thou hast forsaken the LORDthy God, and that my fear [is] not in thee, saith the Lord GOD of hosts.   

{2:20} For of old time I have broken thy yoke, [and] burst thybands; and thou saidst, I will not transgress; when upon every highhill and under every green tree thou wanderest, playing the harlot.

{2:21} Yet I had planted thee a noble vine, wholly a right seed: howthen art thou turned into the degenerate plant of a strange vine untome? 

{2:22} For though thou wash thee with nitre, and take thee muchsope, [yet] thine iniquity is marked before me, saith the Lord GOD.

{2:23} How canst thou say, I am not polluted, I have not gone afterBaalim? see thy way in the valley, know what thou hast done: [thou art]a swift dromedary traversing her ways; 

{2:24} A wild ass used to thewilderness, [that] snuffeth up the wind at her pleasure; in heroccasion who can turn her away? all they that seek her will not wearythemselves; in her month they shall find her. 

{2:25} Withhold thy footfrom being unshod, and thy throat from thirst: but thou saidst, Thereis no hope: no; for I have loved strangers, and after them will I go.

{2:26} As the thief is ashamed when he is found, so is the house ofIsrael ashamed; they, their kings, their princes, and their priests,and their prophets, 

{2:27} Saying to a stock, Thou [art] my father; andto a stone, Thou hast brought me forth: for they have turned [their]back unto me, and not [their] face: but in the time of their troublethey will say, Arise, and save us. 

{2:28} But where [are] thy gods thatthou hast made thee? let them arise, if they can save thee in the timeof thy trouble: for [according to] the number of thy cities are thygods, O Judah. 

{2:29} Wherefore will ye plead with me? ye all havetransgressed against me, saith the LORD. 

{2:30} In vain have I smittenyour children; they received no correction: your own sword hathdevoured your prophets, like a destroying lion.   

{2:31} O generation, see ye the word of the LORD. Have I been awilderness unto Israel? a land of darkness? wherefore say my people, Weare lords; we will come no more unto thee? 

{2:32} Can a maid forget herornaments, [or] a bride her attire? yet my people have forgotten medays without number. 

{2:33} Why trimmest thou thy way to seek love?therefore hast thou also taught the wicked ones thy ways. 

{2:34} Alsoin thy skirts is found the blood of the souls of the poor innocents: Ihave not found it by secret search, but upon all these. 

{2:35} Yet thousayest, Because I am innocent, surely his anger shall turn from me.Behold, I will plead with thee, because thou sayest, I have not sinned.

{2:36} Why gaddest thou about so much to change thy way? thou alsoshalt be ashamed of Egypt, as thou wast ashamed of Assyria. 

{2:37} Yea,thou shalt go forth from him, and thine hands upon thine head: for theLORD hath rejected thy confidences, and thou shalt not prosper in them.   

{3:1} They say, If a man put away his wife, and she go from him, andbecome another man's, shall he return unto her again? shall not thatland be greatly polluted? but thou hast played the harlot with manylovers; yet return again to me, saith the LORD. 

{3:2} Lift up thineeyes unto the high places, and see where thou hast not been lien with.In the ways hast thou sat for them, as the Arabian in the wilderness;and thou hast polluted the land with thy whoredoms and with thywickedness. 

{3:3} Therefore the showers have been withholden, and therehath been no latter rain; and thou hadst a whore's forehead, thourefusedst to be ashamed. 

{3:4} Wilt thou not from this time cry untome, My father, thou art the guide of my youth? 

{3:5} Will he reserve[his anger] for ever? will he keep [it] to the end? Behold, thou hastspoken and done evil things as thou couldest.   

{3:6} The LORD said also unto me in the days of Josiah the king,Hast thou seen [that] which backsliding Israel hath done? she is goneup upon every high mountain and under every green tree, and there hathplayed the harlot. 

{3:7} And I said after she had done all these[things,] Turn thou unto me. But she returned not. And her treacheroussister Judah saw [it. ]

{3:8} And I saw, when for all the causes wherebybacksliding Israel committed adultery I had put her away, and given hera bill of divorce; yet her treacherous sister Judah feared not, butwent and played the harlot also. 

{3:9} And it came to pass through thelightness of her whoredom, that she defiled the land, and committedadultery with stones and with stocks. 

{3:10} And yet for all this hertreacherous sister Judah hath not turned unto me with her whole heart,but feignedly, saith the LORD. 

{3:11} And the LORD said unto me, Thebacksliding Israel hath justified herself more than treacherous Judah.   

{3:12} Go and proclaim these words toward the north, and say,Return, thou backsliding Israel, saith the LORD; [and] I will not causemine anger to fall upon you: for I [am] merciful, saith the LORD, [and]I will not keep [anger] for ever. 

{3:13} Only acknowledge thineiniquity, that thou hast transgressed against the LORD thy God, andhast scattered thy ways to the strangers under every green tree, and yehave not obeyed my voice, saith the LORD. 

{3:14} Turn, O backslidingchildren, saith the LORD; for I am married unto you: and I will takeyou one of a city, and two of a family, and I will bring you to Zion:

{3:15} And I will give you pastors according to mine heart, which shallfeed you with knowledge and understanding. 

{3:16} And it shall come topass, when ye be multiplied and increased in the land, in those days,saith the LORD, they shall say no more, The ark of the covenant of theLORD: neither shall it come to mind: neither shall they remember it;neither shall they visit [it;] neither shall [that] be done any more.

{3:17} At that time they shall call Jerusalem the throne of the LORD;and all the nations shall be gathered unto it, to the name of the LORD,to Jerusalem: neither shall they walk any more after the imagination oftheir evil heart. 

{3:18} In those days the house of Judah shall walkwith the house of Israel, and they shall come together out of the landof the north to the land that I have given for an inheritance unto yourfathers. 

{3:19} But I said, How shall I put thee among the children,and give thee a pleasant land, a goodly heritage of the hosts ofnations? and I said, Thou shalt call me, My father; and shalt not turnaway from me.   

{3:20} Surely [as] a wife treacherously departeth from her husband,so have ye dealt treacherously with me, O house of Israel, saith theLORD. 

{3:21} A voice was heard upon the high places, weeping [and]supplications of the children of Israel: for they have perverted theirway, [and] they have forgotten the LORD their God. 

{3:22} Return, yebacksliding children, [and] I will heal your backslidings. Behold, wecome unto thee; for thou [art] the LORD our God. 

{3:23} Truly in vain[is salvation hoped for] from the hills, [and from] the multitude ofmountains: truly in the LORD our God [is] the salvation of Israel.

{3:24} For shame hath devoured the labour of our fathers from ouryouth; their flocks and their herds, their sons and their daughters.

{3:25} We lie down in our shame, and our confusion covereth us: for wehave sinned against the LORD our God, we and our fathers, from ouryouth even unto this day, and have not obeyed the voice of the LORD ourGod.   

{4:1} If thou wilt return, O Israel, saith the LORD, return unto me:and if thou wilt put away thine abominations out of my sight, thenshalt thou not remove. 

{4:2} And thou shalt swear, The LORD liveth, intruth, in judgment, and in righteousness; and the nations shall blessthemselves in him, and in him shall they glory.   

{4:3} For thus saith the LORD to the men of Judah and Jerusalem,Break up your fallow ground, and sow not among thorns. 

{4:4} Circumciseyourselves to the LORD, and take away the foreskins of your heart, yemen of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem: lest my fury come forth likefire, and burn that none can quench [it,] because of the evil of yourdoings. 

{4:5} Declare ye in Judah, and publish in Jerusalem; and say,Blow ye the trumpet in the land: cry, gather together, and say,Assemble yourselves, and let us go into the defenced cities. 

{4:6} Setup the standard toward Zion: retire, stay not: for I will bring evilfrom the north, and a great destruction. 

{4:7} The lion is come up fromhis thicket, and the destroyer of the Gentiles is on his way; he isgone forth from his place to make thy land desolate; [and] thy citiesshall be laid waste, without an inhabitant. 

{4:8} For this gird youwith sackcloth, lament and howl: for the fierce anger of the LORD isnot turned back from us. 

{4:9} And it shall come to pass at that day,saith the LORD, [that] the heart of the king shall perish, and theheart of the princes; and the priests shall be astonished, and theprophets shall wonder. 

{4:10} Then said I, Ah, Lord GOD! surely thouhast greatly deceived this people and Jerusalem, saying, Ye shall havepeace; whereas the sword reacheth unto the soul. 

{4:11} At that timeshall it be said to this people and to Jerusalem, A dry wind of thehigh places in the wilderness toward the daughter of my people, not tofan, nor to cleanse, 

{4:12} [Even ]a full wind from those [places]shall come unto me: now also will I give sentence against them. 

{4:13}Behold, he shall come up as clouds, and his chariots [shall be] as awhirlwind: his horses are swifter than eagles. Woe unto us! for we arespoiled. 

{4:14} O Jerusalem, wash thine heart from wickedness, thatthou mayest be saved. How long shall thy vain thoughts lodge withinthee? 

{4:15} For a voice declareth from Dan, and publisheth afflictionfrom mount Ephraim. 

{4:16} Make ye mention to the nations; behold,publish against Jerusalem, [that] watchers come from a far country, andgive out their voice against the cities of Judah. 

{4:17} As keepers ofa field, are they against her round about; because she hath beenrebellious against me, saith the LORD. 

{4:18} Thy way and thy doingshave procured these [things] unto thee; this [is] thy wickedness,because it is bitter, because it reacheth unto thine heart.   

{4:19} My bowels, my bowels! I am pained at my very heart; my heartmaketh a noise in me; I cannot hold my peace, because thou hast heard,O my soul, the sound of the trump, the alarm of war. 

{4:20} Destructionupon destruction is cried; for the whole land is spoiled: suddenly aremy tents spoiled, [and] my curtains in a moment. 

{4:21} How long shallI see the standard, [and] hear the sound of the trumpet? 

{4:22} For mypeople [is] foolish, they have not known me; they [are] sottishchildren, and they have none understanding: they [are] wise to do evil,but to do good they have no knowledge. 

{4:23} I beheld the earth, and,lo, [it was] without form, and void; and the heavens, and they [had] nolight. 

{4:24} I beheld the mountains, and, lo, they trembled, and allthe hills moved lightly. 

{4:25} I beheld, and, lo, [there was] no man,and all the birds of the heavens were fled. 

{4:26} I beheld, and, lo,the fruitful place [was] a wilderness, and all the cities thereof werebroken down at the presence of the LORD, [and] by his fierce anger.

{4:27} For thus hath the LORD said, The whole land shall be desolate;yet will I not make a full end. 

{4:28} For this shall the earth mourn,and the heavens above be black: because I have spoken [it,] I havepurposed [it,] and will not repent, neither will I turn back from it.

{4:29} The whole city shall flee for the noise of the horsemen andbowmen; they shall go into thickets, and climb up upon the rocks: everycity [shall be] forsaken, and not a man dwell therein. 

{4:30} And[when] thou [art] spoiled, what wilt thou do? Though thou clothestthyself with crimson, though thou deckest thee with ornaments of gold,though thou rentest thy face with painting, in vain shalt thou makethyself fair; [thy] lovers will despise thee, they will seek thy life.

{4:31} For I have heard a voice as of a woman in travail, [and] theanguish as of her that bringeth forth her first child, the voice of thedaughter of Zion, [that] bewaileth herself, [that] spreadeth her hands,[saying,] Woe [is] me now! for my soul is wearied because of murderers.   

{5:1} Run ye to and fro through the streets of Jerusalem, and seenow, and know, and seek in the broad places thereof, if ye can find aman, if there be [any] that executeth judgment, that seeketh the truth;and I will pardon it. 

{5:2} And though they say, The LORD liveth;surely they swear falsely. 

{5:3} O LORD, [are] not thine eyes upon thetruth? thou hast stricken them, but they have not grieved; thou hastconsumed them, [but] they have refused to receive correction: they havemade their faces harder than a rock; they have refused to return. 

{5:4}Therefore I said, Surely these [are] poor; they are foolish: for theyknow not the way of the LORD, [nor] the judgment of their God. 

{5:5} Iwill get me unto the great men, and will speak unto them; for they haveknown the way of the LORD, [and] the judgment of their God: but thesehave altogether broken the yoke, [and] burst the bonds. 

{5:6} Whereforea lion out of the forest shall slay them, [and] a wolf of the eveningsshall spoil them, a leopard shall watch over their cities: every onethat goeth out thence shall be torn in pieces: because theirtransgressions are many, [and] their backslidings are increased.   

{5:7} How shall I pardon thee for this? thy children have forsakenme, and sworn by [them that are] no gods: when I had fed them to thefull, they then committed adultery, and assembled themselves by troopsin the harlots' houses. 

{5:8} They were [as] fed horses in the morning:every one neighed after his neighbour's wife. 

{5:9} Shall I not visitfor these [things?] saith the LORD: and shall not my soul be avenged onsuch a nation as this?   

{5:10} Go ye up upon her walls, and destroy; but make not a fullend: take away her battlements; for they [are] not the LORD'S. 

{5:11}For the house of Israel and the house of Judah have dealt verytreacherously against me, saith the LORD. 

{5:12} They have belied theLORD, and said, [It is] not he; neither shall evil come upon us;neither shall we see sword nor famine: 

{5:13} And the prophets shallbecome wind, and the word [is] not in them: thus shall it be done untothem. 

{5:14} Wherefore thus saith the LORD God of hosts, Because yespeak this word, behold, I will make my words in thy mouth fire, andthis people wood, and it shall devour them. 

{5:15} Lo, I will bring anation upon you from far, O house of Israel, saith the LORD: it [is] amighty nation, it [is] an ancient nation, a nation whose language thouknowest not, neither understandest what they say. 

{5:16} Their quiver[is] as an open sepulchre, they [are] all mighty men. 

{5:17} And theyshall eat up thine harvest, and thy bread, [which] thy sons and thydaughters should eat: they shall eat up thy flocks and thine herds:they shall eat up thy vines and thy fig trees: they shall impoverishthy fenced cities, wherein thou trustedst, with the sword. 

{5:18}Nevertheless in those days, saith the LORD, I will not make a full endwith you.   

{5:19} And it shall come to pass, when ye shall say, Wherefore doeththe LORD our God all these [things] unto us? then shalt thou answerthem, Like as ye have forsaken me, and served strange gods in yourland, so shall ye serve strangers in a land [that is] not yours. 

{5:20}Declare this in the house of Jacob, and publish it in Judah, saying,

{5:21} Hear now this, O foolish people, and without understanding;which have eyes, and see not; which have ears, and hear not: 

{5:22}Fear ye not me? saith the LORD: will ye not tremble at my presence,which have placed the sand [for] the bound of the sea by a perpetualdecree, that it cannot pass it: and though the waves thereof tossthemselves, yet can they not prevail; though they roar, yet can theynot pass over it? 

{5:23} But this people hath a revolting and arebellious heart; they are revolted and gone. 

{5:24} Neither say theyin their heart, Let us now fear the LORD our God, that giveth rain,both the former and the latter, in his season: he reserveth unto us theappointed weeks of the harvest.   

{5:25} Your iniquities have turned away these [things,] and yoursins have withholden good [things] from you. 

{5:26} For among my peopleare found wicked [men:] they lay wait, as he that setteth snares; theyset a trap, they catch men. 

{5:27} As a cage is full of birds, so [are]their houses full of deceit: therefore they are become great, and waxenrich. 

{5:28} They are waxen fat, they shine: yea, they overpass thedeeds of the wicked: they judge not the cause, the cause of thefatherless, yet they prosper; and the right of the needy do they notjudge. 

{5:29} Shall I not visit for these [things?] saith the LORD:shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this?   

{5:30} A wonderful and horrible thing is committed in the land;

{5:31} The prophets prophesy falsely, and the priests bear rule bytheir means; and my people love [to have it] so: and what will ye do inthe end thereof?   

{6:1} O ye children of Benjamin, gather yourselves to flee out ofthe midst of Jerusalem, and blow the trumpet in Tekoa, and set up asign of fire in Beth-haccerem: for evil appeareth out of the north, andgreat destruction. 

{6:2} I have likened the daughter of Zion to acomely and delicate [woman. ]

{6:3} The shepherds with their flocksshall come unto her; they shall pitch [their] tents against her roundabout; they shall feed every one in his place. 

{6:4} Prepare ye waragainst her; arise, and let us go up at noon. Woe unto us! for the daygoeth away, for the shadows of the evening are stretched out. 

{6:5}Arise, and let us go by night, and let us destroy her palaces.   

{6:6} For thus hath the LORD of hosts said, Hew ye down trees, andcast a mount against Jerusalem: this [is] the city to be visited; she[is] wholly oppression in the midst of her. 

{6:7} As a fountain castethout her waters, so she casteth out her wickedness: violence and spoilis heard in her; before me continually is grief and wounds. 

{6:8} Bethou instructed, O Jerusalem, lest my soul depart from thee; lest Imake thee desolate, a land not inhabited.   

{6:9} Thus saith the LORD of hosts, They shall throughly glean theremnant of Israel as a vine: turn back thine hand as a grapegathererinto the baskets. 

{6:10} To whom shall I speak, and give warning, thatthey may hear? behold, their ear [is] uncircumcised, and they cannothearken: behold, the word of the LORD is unto them a reproach; theyhave no delight in it. 

{6:11} Therefore I am full of the fury of theLORD; I am weary with holding in: I will pour it out upon the childrenabroad, and upon the assembly of young men together: for even thehusband with the wife shall be taken, the aged with [him that is] fullof days. 

{6:12} And their houses shall be turned unto others, [withtheir] fields and wives together: for I will stretch out my hand uponthe inhabitants of the land, saith the LORD. 

{6:13} For from the leastof them even unto the greatest of them every one [is] given tocovetousness; and from the prophet even unto the priest every onedealeth falsely. 

{6:14} They have healed also the hurt [of thedaughter] of my people slightly, saying, Peace, peace; when [there is]no peace. 

{6:15} Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination?nay, they were not at all ashamed, neither could they blush: thereforethey shall fall among them that fall: at the time [that] I visit themthey shall be cast down, saith the LORD. 

{6:16} Thus saith the LORD,Stand ye in the ways, and see, and ask for the old paths, where is thegood way, and walk therein, and ye shall find rest for your souls. Butthey said, We will not walk [therein. ]

{6:17} Also I set watchmen overyou, [saying,] Hearken to the sound of the trumpet. But they said, Wewill not hearken.   

{6:18} Therefore hear, ye nations, and know, O congregation, what[is] among them. 

{6:19} Hear, O earth: behold, I will bring evil uponthis people, [even] the fruit of their thoughts, because they have nothearkened unto my words, nor to my law, but rejected it. 

{6:20} To whatpurpose cometh there to me incense from Sheba, and the sweet cane froma far country? your burnt offerings [are] not acceptable, nor yoursacrifices sweet unto me. 

{6:21} Therefore thus saith the LORD, Behold,I will lay stumblingblocks before this people, and the fathers and thesons together shall fall upon them; the neighbour and his friend shallperish. 

{6:22} Thus saith the LORD, Behold, a people cometh from thenorth country, and a great nation shall be raised from the sides of theearth. 

{6:23} They shall lay hold on bow and spear; they [are] cruel,and have no mercy; their voice roareth like the sea; and they ride uponhorses, set in array as men for war against thee, O daughter of Zion.

{6:24} We have heard the fame thereof: our hands wax feeble: anguishhath taken hold of us, [and] pain, as of a woman in travail. 

{6:25} Gonot forth into the field, nor walk by the way; for the sword of theenemy [and] fear [is] on every side.   

{6:26} O daughter of my people, gird [thee] with sackcloth, andwallow thyself in ashes: make thee mourning, [as for] an only son, mostbitter lamentation: for the spoiler shall suddenly come upon us. 

{6:27}I have set thee [for] a tower [and] a fortress among my people, thatthou mayest know and try their way. 

{6:28} They [are] all grievousrevolters, walking with slanders: [they are] brass and iron; they [are]all corrupters. 

{6:29} The bellows are burned, the lead is consumed ofthe fire; the founder melteth in vain: for the wicked are not pluckedaway. 

{6:30} Reprobate silver shall [men] call them, because the LORDhath rejected them.   

{7:1} The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying, 

{7:2}Stand in the gate of the LORD'S house, and proclaim there this word,and say, Hear the word of the LORD, all [ye of] Judah, that enter in atthese gates to worship the LORD. 

{7:3} Thus saith the LORD of hosts,the God of Israel, Amend your ways and your doings, and I will causeyou to dwell in this place. 

{7:4} Trust ye not in lying words, saying,The temple of the LORD, The temple of the LORD, The temple of the LORD,[are] these. 

{7:5} For if ye throughly amend your ways and your doings;if ye throughly execute judgment between a man and his neighbour; 

{7:6}[If] ye oppress not the stranger, the fatherless, and the widow, andshed not innocent blood in this place, neither walk after other gods toyour hurt: 

{7:7} Then will I cause you to dwell in this place, in theland that I gave to your fathers, for ever and ever.   

{7:8} Behold, ye trust in lying words, that cannot profit. 

{7:9}Will ye steal, murder, and commit adultery, and swear falsely, and burnincense unto Baal, and walk after other gods whom ye know not; 

{7:10}And come and stand before me in this house, which is called by my name,and say, We are delivered to do all these abominations? 

{7:11} Is thishouse, which is called by my name, become a den of robbers in youreyes? Behold, even I have seen [it,] saith the LORD. 

{7:12} But go yenow unto my place which [was] in Shiloh, where I set my name at thefirst, and see what I did to it for the wickedness of my people Israel.

{7:13} And now, because ye have done all these works, saith the LORD,and I spake unto you, rising up early and speaking, but ye heard not;and I called you, but ye answered not; 

{7:14} Therefore will I do unto[this] house, which is called by my name, wherein ye trust, and untothe place which I gave to you and to your fathers, as I have done toShiloh. 

{7:15} And I will cast you out of my sight, as I have cast outall your brethren, [even] the whole seed of Ephraim. 

{7:16} Thereforepray not thou for this people, neither lift up cry nor prayer for them,neither make intercession to me: for I will not hear thee.   

{7:17} Seest thou not what they do in the cities of Judah and in thestreets of Jerusalem? 

{7:18} The children gather wood, and the fatherskindle the fire, and the women knead [their] dough, to make cakes tothe queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings unto other gods,that they may provoke me to anger. 

{7:19} Do they provoke me to anger?saith the LORD: [do they] not [provoke] themselves to the confusion oftheir own faces? 

{7:20} Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, mineanger and my fury shall be poured out upon this place, upon man, andupon beast, and upon the trees of the field, and upon the fruit of theground; and it shall burn, and shall not be quenched.   

{7:21} Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Put yourburnt offerings unto your sacrifices, and eat flesh. 

{7:22} For I spakenot unto your fathers, nor commanded them in the day that I broughtthem out of the land of Egypt, concerning burnt offerings orsacrifices: 

{7:23} But this thing commanded I them, saying, Obey myvoice, and I will be your God, and ye shall be my people: and walk yein all the ways that I have commanded you, that it may be well untoyou. 

{7:24} But they hearkened not, nor inclined their ear, but walkedin the counsels [and] in the imagination of their evil heart, and wentbackward, and not forward. 

{7:25} Since the day that your fathers cameforth out of the land of Egypt unto this day I have even sent unto youall my servants the prophets, daily rising up early and sending [them:]

{7:26} Yet they hearkened not unto me, nor inclined their ear, buthardened their neck: they did worse than their fathers. 

{7:27}Therefore thou shalt speak all these words unto them; but they will nothearken to thee: thou shalt also call unto them; but they will notanswer thee. 

{7:28} But thou shalt say unto them, This [is] a nationthat obeyeth not the voice of the LORD their God, nor receivethcorrection: truth is perished, and is cut off from their mouth.   

{7:29} Cut off thine hair, [O Jerusalem,] and cast [it] away, andtake up a lamentation on high places; for the LORD hath rejected andforsaken the generation of his wrath. 

{7:30} For the children of Judahhave done evil in my sight, saith the LORD: they have set theirabominations in the house which is called by my name, to pollute it.

{7:31} And they have built the high places of Tophet, which is in thevalley of the son of Hinnom, to burn their sons and their daughters inthe fire; which I commanded [them] not, neither came it into my heart.   

{7:32} Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that itshall no more be called Tophet, nor the valley of the son of Hinnom,but the valley of slaughter: for they shall bury in Tophet, till therebe no place. 

{7:33} And the carcases of this people shall be meat forthe fowls of the heaven, and for the beasts of the earth; and noneshall fray [them] away. 

{7:34} Then will I cause to cease from thecities of Judah, and from the streets of Jerusalem, the voice of mirth,and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voiceof the bride: for the land shall be desolate.   

{8:1} At that time, saith the LORD, they shall bring out the bonesof the kings of Judah, and the bones of his princes, and the bones ofthe priests, and the bones of the prophets, and the bones of theinhabitants of Jerusalem, out of their graves: 

{8:2} And they shallspread them before the sun, and the moon, and all the host of heaven,whom they have loved, and whom they have served, and after whom theyhave walked, and whom they have sought, and whom they have worshipped:they shall not be gathered, nor be buried; they shall be for dung uponthe face of the earth. 

{8:3} And death shall be chosen rather than lifeby all the residue of them that remain of this evil family, whichremain in all the places whither I have driven them, saith the LORD ofhosts.   

{8:4} Moreover thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the LORD; Shallthey fall, and not arise? shall he turn away, and not return? 

{8:5} Why[then] is this people of Jerusalem slidden back by a perpetualbacksliding? they hold fast deceit, they refuse to return. 

{8:6} Ihearkened and heard, [but] they spake not aright: no man repented himof his wickedness, saying, What have I done? every one turned to hiscourse, as the horse rusheth into the battle. 

{8:7} Yea, the stork inthe heaven knoweth her appointed times; and the turtle and the craneand the swallow observe the time of their coming; but my people knownot the judgment of the LORD. 

{8:8} How do ye say, We [are] wise, andthe law of the LORD [is] with us? Lo, certainly in vain made he [it;]the pen of the scribes [is] in vain. 

{8:9} The wise [men] are ashamed,they are dismayed and taken: lo, they have rejected the word of theLORD; and what wisdom [is] in them? 

{8:10} Therefore will I give theirwives unto others, [and] their fields to them that shall inherit[them:] for every one from the least even unto the greatest is given tocovetousness, from the prophet even unto the priest every one dealethfalsely. 

{8:11} For they have healed the hurt of the daughter of mypeople slightly, saying, Peace, peace; when [there is] no peace. 

{8:12}Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination? nay, they werenot at all ashamed, neither could they blush: therefore shall they fallamong them that fall: in the time of their visitation they shall becast down, saith the LORD.   

{8:13} I will surely consume them, saith the LORD: [there shall be]no grapes on the vine, nor figs on the fig tree, and the leaf shallfade; and [the things that] I have given them shall pass away fromthem. 

{8:14} Why do we sit still? assemble yourselves, and let us enterinto the defenced cities, and let us be silent there: for the LORD ourGod hath put us to silence, and given us water of gall to drink,because we have sinned against the LORD. 

{8:15} We looked for peace,but no good [came; and] for a time of health, and behold trouble!

{8:16} The snorting of his horses was heard from Dan: the whole landtrembled at the sound of the neighing of his strong ones; for they arecome, and have devoured the land, and all that is in it; the city, andthose that dwell therein. 

{8:17} For, behold, I will send serpents,cockatrices, among you, which [will] not [be] charmed, and they shallbite you, saith the LORD.   

{8:18} [When] I would comfort myself against sorrow, my heart [is]faint in me. 

{8:19} Behold the voice of the cry of the daughter of mypeople because of them that dwell in a far country: [Is] not the LORDin Zion? [is] not her king in her? Why have they provoked me to angerwith their graven images, [and] with strange vanities? 

{8:20} Theharvest is past, the summer is ended, and we are not saved. 

{8:21} Forthe hurt of the daughter of my people am I hurt; I am black;astonishment hath taken hold on me. 

{8:22} [Is there] no balm inGilead; [is there] no physician there? why then is not the health ofthe daughter of my people recovered?   

{9:1} Oh that my head were waters, and mine eyes a fountain oftears, that I might weep day and night for the slain of the daughter ofmy people! 

{9:2} Oh that I had in the wilderness a lodging place ofwayfaring men; that I might leave my people, and go from them! for they[be] all adulterers, an assembly of treacherous men. 

{9:3} And theybend their tongues [like] their bow [for] lies: but they are notvaliant for the truth upon the earth; for they proceed from evil toevil, and they know not me, saith the LORD. 

{9:4} Take ye heed everyone of his neighbour, and trust ye not in any brother: for everybrother will utterly supplant, and every neighbour will walk withslanders. 

{9:5} And they will deceive every one his neighbour, and willnot speak the truth: they have taught their tongue to speak lies, [and]weary themselves to commit iniquity. 

{9:6} Thine habitation [is] in themidst of deceit; through deceit they refuse to know me, saith the LORD.

{9:7} Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, Behold, I will melt them,and try them; for how shall I do for the daughter of my people? 

{9:8}Their tongue [is as] an arrow shot out; it speaketh deceit: [one]speaketh peaceably to his neighbour with his mouth, but in heart helayeth his wait.   

{9:9} Shall I not visit them for these [things?] saith the LORD:shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this? 

{9:10} For themountains will I take up a weeping and wailing, and for the habitationsof the wilderness a lamentation, because they are burned up, so thatnone can pass through [them;] neither can [men] hear the voice of thecattle; both the fowl of the heavens and the beast are fled; they aregone. 

{9:11} And I will make Jerusalem heaps, [and] a den of dragons;and I will make the cities of Judah desolate, without an inhabitant.   

{9:12} Who [is] the wise man, that may understand this? and [who ishe] to whom the mouth of the LORD hath spoken, that he may declare it,for what the land perisheth [and] is burned up like a wilderness, thatnone passeth through? 

{9:13} And the LORD saith, Because they haveforsaken my law which I set before them, and have not obeyed my voice,neither walked therein; 

{9:14} But have walked after the imagination oftheir own heart, and after Baalim, which their fathers taught them:

{9:15} Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel;Behold, I will feed them, [even] this people, with wormwood, and givethem water of gall to drink. 

{9:16} I will scatter them also among theheathen, whom neither they nor their fathers have known: and I willsend a sword after them, till I have consumed them.   

{9:17} Thus saith the LORD of hosts, Consider ye, and call for themourning women, that they may come; and send for cunning [women,] thatthey may come: 

{9:18} And let them make haste, and take up a wailingfor us, that our eyes may run down with tears, and our eyelids gush outwith waters. 

{9:19} For a voice of wailing is heard out of Zion, Howare we spoiled! we are greatly confounded, because we have forsaken theland, because our dwellings have cast [us] out. 

{9:20} Yet hear theword of the LORD, O ye women, and let your ear receive the word of hismouth, and teach your daughters wailing, and every one her neighbourlamentation. 

{9:21} For death is come up into our windows, [and] isentered into our palaces, to cut off the children from without, [and]the young men from the streets. 

{9:22} Speak, Thus saith the LORD, Eventhe carcases of men shall fall as dung upon the open field, and as thehandful after the harvestman, and none shall gather [them.]   

{9:23} Thus saith the LORD, Let not the wise [man] glory in hiswisdom, neither let the mighty [man] glory in his might, let not therich [man] glory in his riches: 

{9:24} But let him that glorieth gloryin this, that he understandeth and knoweth me, that I [am] the LORDwhich exercise lovingkindness, judgment, and righteousness, in theearth: for in these [things] I delight, saith the LORD.   

{9:25} Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will punish all[them which are] circumcised with the uncircumcised; 

{9:26} Egypt, andJudah, and Edom, and the children of Ammon, and Moab, and all [thatare] in the utmost corners, that dwell in the wilderness: for all[these] nations [are] uncircumcised, and all the house of Israel [are]uncircumcised in the heart.   

{10:1} Hear ye the word which the LORD speaketh unto you, O house ofIsrael: 

{10:2} Thus saith the LORD, Learn not the way of the heathen,and be not dismayed at the signs of heaven; for the heathen aredismayed at them. 

{10:3} For the customs of the people [are] vain: for[one] cutteth a tree out of the forest, the work of the hands of theworkman, with the axe. 

{10:4} They deck it with silver and with gold;they fasten it with nails and with hammers, that it move not. 

{10:5}They [are] upright as the palm tree, but speak not: they must needs beborne, because they cannot go. Be not afraid of them; for they cannotdo evil, neither also [is it] in them to do good. 

{10:6} Forasmuch as[there is] none like unto thee, O LORD; thou [art] great, and thy nameis great in might. 

{10:7} Who would not fear thee, O King of nations?for to thee doth it appertain: forasmuch as among all the wise [men] ofthe nations, and in all their kingdoms, [there is] none like unto thee.

{10:8} But they are altogether brutish and foolish: the stock [is] adoctrine of vanities. 

{10:9} Silver spread into plates is brought fromTarshish, and gold from Uphaz, the work of the workman, and of thehands of the founder: blue and purple is their clothing: they [are] allthe work of cunning [men. ]

{10:10} But the LORD [is] the true God, he[is] the living God, and an everlasting king: at his wrath the earthshall tremble, and the nations shall not be able to abide hisindignation. 

{10:11} Thus shall ye say unto them, The gods that havenot made the heavens and the earth, [even] they shall perish from theearth, and from under these heavens. 

{10:12} He hath made the earth byhis power, he hath established the world by his wisdom, and hathstretched out the heavens by his discretion. 

{10:13} When he utterethhis voice, [there is] a multitude of waters in the heavens, and hecauseth the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth; he makethlightnings with rain, and bringeth forth the wind out of his treasures.

{10:14} Every man is brutish in [his] knowledge: every founder isconfounded by the graven image: for his molten image is falsehood, and[there is] no breath in them. 

{10:15} They [are] vanity, [and] the workof errors: in the time of their visitation they shall perish. 

{10:16}The portion of Jacob [is] not like them: for he [is] the former of all[things;] and Israel [is] the rod of his inheritance: The LORD of hosts[is] his name.   

{10:17} Gather up thy wares out of the land, O inhabitant of thefortress. 

{10:18} For thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will sling out theinhabitants of the land at this once, and will distress them, that theymay find [it] so.   

{10:19} Woe is me for my hurt! my wound is grievous: but I said,Truly this [is] a grief, and I must bear it. 

{10:20} My tabernacle isspoiled, and all my cords are broken: my children are gone forth of me,and they [are] not: [there is] none to stretch forth my tent any more,and to set up my curtains. 

{10:21} For the pastors are become brutish,and have not sought the LORD: therefore they shall not prosper, and alltheir flocks shall be scattered. 

{10:22} Behold, the noise of the bruitis come, and a great commotion out of the north country, to make thecities of Judah desolate, [and] a den of dragons.   

{10:23} O LORD, I know that the way of man [is] not in himself: [itis] not in man that walketh to direct his steps. 

{10:24} O LORD,correct me, but with judgment; not in thine anger, lest thou bring meto nothing. 

{10:25} Pour out thy fury upon the heathen that know theenot, and upon the families that call not on thy name: for they haveeaten up Jacob, and devoured him, and consumed him, and have made hishabitation desolate.   

{11:1} The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying, 

{11:2}Hear ye the words of this covenant, and speak unto the men of Judah,and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem; 

{11:3} And say thou unto them,Thus saith the LORD God of Israel; Cursed [be] the man that obeyeth notthe words of this covenant, 

{11:4} Which I commanded your fathers inthe day [that] I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, from theiron furnace, saying, Obey my voice, and do them, according to allwhich I command you: so shall ye be my people, and I will be your God:

{11:5} That I may perform the oath which I have sworn unto yourfathers, to give them a land flowing with milk and honey, as [it is]this day. Then answered I, and said, So be it, O LORD. 

{11:6} Then theLORD said unto me, Proclaim all these words in the cities of Judah, andin the streets of Jerusalem, saying, Hear ye the words of thiscovenant, and do them. 

{11:7} For I earnestly protested unto yourfathers in the day [that] I brought them up out of the land of Egypt,[even] unto this day, rising early and protesting, saying, Obey myvoice. 

{11:8} Yet they obeyed not, nor inclined their ear, but walkedevery one in the imagination of their evil heart: therefore I willbring upon them all the words of this covenant, which I commanded[them] to do; but they did [them] not. 

{11:9} And the LORD said untome, A conspiracy is found among the men of Judah, and among theinhabitants of Jerusalem. 

{11:10} They are turned back to theiniquities of their forefathers, which refused to hear my words; andthey went after other gods to serve them: the house of Israel and thehouse of Judah have broken my covenant which I made with their fathers.   

{11:11} Therefore thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will bring evilupon them, which they shall not be able to escape; and though theyshall cry unto me, I will not hearken unto them. 

{11:12} Then shall thecities of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem go, and cry unto the godsunto whom they offer incense: but they shall not save them at all inthe time of their trouble. 

{11:13} For [according to] the number of thycities were thy gods, O Judah; and [according to] the number of thestreets of Jerusalem have ye set up altars to [that] shameful thing,[even] altars to burn incense unto Baal. 

{11:14} Therefore pray notthou for this people, neither lift up a cry or prayer for them: for Iwill not hear [them] in the time that they cry unto me for theirtrouble. 

{11:15} What hath my beloved to do in mine house, [seeing] shehath wrought lewdness with many, and the holy flesh is passed fromthee? when thou doest evil, then thou rejoicest. 

{11:16} The LORDcalled thy name, A green olive tree, fair, [and] of goodly fruit: withthe noise of a great tumult he hath kindled fire upon it, and thebranches of it are broken. 

{11:17} For the LORD of hosts, that plantedthee, hath pronounced evil against thee, for the evil of the house ofIsrael and of the house of Judah, which they have done againstthemselves to provoke me to anger in offering incense unto Baal.   

{11:18} And the LORD hath given me knowledge [of it,] and I know[it:] then thou shewedst me their doings. 

{11:19} But I [was] like alamb [or] an ox [that] is brought to the slaughter; and I knew not thatthey had devised devices against me, [saying,] Let us destroy the treewith the fruit thereof, and let us cut him off from the land of theliving, that his name may be no more remembered. 

{11:20} But, O LORD ofhosts, that judgest righteously, that triest the reins and the heart,let me see thy vengeance on them: for unto thee have I revealed mycause. 

{11:21} Therefore thus saith the LORD of the men of Anathoth,that seek thy life, saying, Prophesy not in the name of the LORD, thatthou die not by our hand: 

{11:22} Therefore thus saith the LORD ofhosts, Behold, I will punish them: the young men shall die by thesword; their sons and their daughters shall die by famine: 

{11:23} Andthere shall be no remnant of them: for I will bring evil upon the menof Anathoth, [even] the year of their visitation.   

{12:1} Righteous [art] thou, O LORD, when I plead with thee: yet letme talk with thee of [thy] judgments: Wherefore doth the way of thewicked prosper? [wherefore] are all they happy that deal verytreacherously? 

{12:2} Thou hast planted them, yea, they have takenroot: they grow, yea, they bring forth fruit: thou [art] near in theirmouth, and far from their reins. 

{12:3} But thou, O LORD, knowest me:thou hast seen me, and tried mine heart toward thee: pull them out likesheep for the slaughter, and prepare them for the day of slaughter.

{12:4} How long shall the land mourn, and the herbs of every fieldwither, for the wickedness of them that dwell therein? the beasts areconsumed, and the birds; because they said, He shall not see our lastend. 

{12:5} If thou hast run with the footmen, and they have weariedthee, then how canst thou contend with horses? and [if] in the land ofpeace, [wherein] thou trustedst, [they wearied thee,] then how wiltthou do in the swelling of Jordan? 

{12:6} For even thy brethren, andthe house of thy father, even they have dealt treacherously with thee;yea, they have called a multitude after thee: believe them not, thoughthey speak fair words unto thee.   

{12:7} I have forsaken mine house, I have left mine heritage; I havegiven the dearly beloved of my soul into the hand of her enemies.

{12:8} Mine heritage is unto me as a lion in the forest; it crieth outagainst me: therefore have I hated it. 

{12:9} Mine heritage [is] untome [as] a speckled bird, the birds round about [are] against her; comeye, assemble all the beasts of the field, come to devour. 

{12:10} Manypastors have destroyed my vineyard, they have trodden my portion underfoot, they have made my pleasant portion a desolate wilderness. 

{12:11}They have made it desolate, [and being] desolate it mourneth unto me;the whole land is made desolate, because no man layeth [it] to heart.

{12:12} The spoilers are come upon all high places through thewilderness: for the sword of the LORD shall devour from the [one] endof the land even to the [other] end of the land: no flesh shall havepeace. 

{12:13} They have sown wheat, but shall reap thorns: they haveput themselves to pain, [but] shall not profit: and they shall beashamed of your revenues because of the fierce anger of the LORD.   

{12:14} Thus saith the LORD against all mine evil neighbours, thattouch the inheritance which I have caused my people Israel to inherit;Behold, I will pluck them out of their land, and pluck out the house ofJudah from among them. 

{12:15} And it shall come to pass, after that Ihave plucked them out I will return, and have compassion on them, andwill bring them again, every man to his heritage, and every man to hisland. 

{12:16} And it shall come to pass, if they will diligently learnthe ways of my people, to swear by my name, The LORD liveth; as theytaught my people to swear by Baal; then shall they be built in themidst of my people. 

{12:17} But if they will not obey, I will utterlypluck up and destroy that nation, saith the LORD.   

{13:1} Thus saith the LORD unto me, Go and get thee a linen girdle,and put it upon thy loins, and put it not in water. 

{13:2} So I got agirdle according to the word of the LORD, and put [it] on my loins.

{13:3} And the word of the LORD came unto me the second time, saying,

{13:4} Take the girdle that thou hast got, which [is] upon thy loins,and arise, go to Euphrates, and hide it there in a hole of the rock.

{13:5} So I went, and hid it by Euphrates, as the LORD commanded me.

{13:6} And it came to pass after many days, that the LORD said unto me,Arise, go to Euphrates, and take the girdle from thence, which Icommanded thee to hide there. 

{13:7} Then I went to Euphrates, anddigged, and took the girdle from the place where I had hid it: and,behold, the girdle was marred, it was profitable for nothing. 

{13:8}Then the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 

{13:9} Thus saith theLORD, After this manner will I mar the pride of Judah, and the greatpride of Jerusalem. 

{13:10} This evil people, which refuse to hear mywords, which walk in the imagination of their heart, and walk afterother gods, to serve them, and to worship them, shall even be as thisgirdle, which is good for nothing. 

{13:11} For as the girdle cleavethto the loins of a man, so have I caused to cleave unto me the wholehouse of Israel and the whole house of Judah, saith the LORD; that theymight be unto me for a people, and for a name, and for a praise, andfor a glory: but they would not hear.   

{13:12} Therefore thou shalt speak unto them this word; Thus saiththe LORD God of Israel, Every bottle shall be filled with wine: andthey shall say unto thee, Do we not certainly know that every bottleshall be filled with wine? 

{13:13} Then shalt thou say unto them, Thussaith the LORD, Behold, I will fill all the inhabitants of this land,even the kings that sit upon David's throne, and the priests, and theprophets, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, with drunkenness.

{13:14} And I will dash them one against another, even the fathers andthe sons together, saith the LORD: I will not pity, nor spare, nor havemercy, but destroy them.   

{13:15} Hear ye, and give ear; be not proud: for the LORD hathspoken. 

{13:16} Give glory to the LORD your God, before he causedarkness, and before your feet stumble upon the dark mountains, and,while ye look for light, he turn it into the shadow of death, [and]make [it] gross darkness. 

{13:17} But if ye will not hear it, my soulshall weep in secret places for [your] pride; and mine eye shall weepsore, and run down with tears, because the LORD'S flock is carried awaycaptive. 

{13:18} Say unto the king and to the queen, Humble yourselves,sit down: for your principalities shall come down, [even] the crown ofyour glory. 

{13:19} The cities of the south shall be shut up, and noneshall open [them:] Judah shall be carried away captive all of it, itshall be wholly carried away captive. 

{13:20} Lift up your eyes, andbehold them that come from the north: where [is] the flock [that] wasgiven thee, thy beautiful flock? 

{13:21} What wilt thou say when heshall punish thee? for thou hast taught them [to be] captains, [and] aschief over thee: shall not sorrows take thee, as a woman in travail?   

{13:22} And if thou say in thine heart, Wherefore come these thingsupon me? For the greatness of thine iniquity are thy skirts discovered,[and] thy heels made bare. 

{13:23} Can the Ethiopian change his skin,or the leopard his spots? [then] may ye also do good, that areaccustomed to do evil. 

{13:24} Therefore will I scatter them as thestubble that passeth away by the wind of the wilderness. 

{13:25} This[is] thy lot, the portion of thy measures from me, saith the LORD;because thou hast forgotten me, and trusted in falsehood. 

{13:26}Therefore will I discover thy skirts upon thy face, that thy shame mayappear. 

{13:27} I have seen thine adulteries, and thy neighings, thelewdness of thy whoredom, [and] thine abominations on the hills in thefields. Woe unto thee, O Jerusalem! wilt thou not be made clean? when[shall it] once [be?]   

{14:1} The word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah concerning thedearth. 

{14:2} Judah mourneth, and the gates thereof languish; they areblack unto the ground; and the cry of Jerusalem is gone up. 

{14:3} Andtheir nobles have sent their little ones to the waters: they came tothe pits, [and] found no water; they returned with their vessels empty;they were ashamed and confounded, and covered their heads. 

{14:4}Because the ground is chapt, for there was no rain in the earth, theplowmen were ashamed, they covered their heads. 

{14:5} Yea, the hindalso calved in the field, and forsook [it,] because there was no grass.

{14:6} And the wild asses did stand in the high places, they snuffed upthe wind like dragons; their eyes did fail, because [there was] nograss.   

{14:7} O LORD, though our iniquities testify against us, do thou[it] for thy name's sake: for our backslidings are many; we have sinnedagainst thee. 

{14:8} O the hope of Israel, the saviour thereof in timeof trouble, why shouldest thou be as a stranger in the land, and as awayfaring man [that] turneth aside to tarry for a night? 

{14:9} Whyshouldest thou be as a man astonied, as a mighty man [that] cannotsave? yet thou, O LORD, [art] in the midst of us, and we are called bythy name; leave us not.   

{14:10} Thus saith the LORD unto this people, Thus have they lovedto wander, they have not refrained their feet, therefore the LORD dothnot accept them; he will now remember their iniquity, and visit theirsins. 

{14:11} Then said the LORD unto me, Pray not for this people for[their] good. 

{14:12} When they fast, I will not hear their cry; andwhen they offer burnt offering and an oblation, I will not accept them:but I will consume them by the sword, and by the famine, and by thepestilence.   

{14:13} Then said I, Ah, Lord GOD! behold, the prophets say untothem, Ye shall not see the sword, neither shall ye have famine; but Iwill give you assured peace in this place. 

{14:14} Then the LORD saidunto me, The prophets prophesy lies in my name: I sent them not,neither have I commanded them, neither spake unto them: they prophesyunto you a false vision and divination, and a thing of nought, and thedeceit of their heart. 

{14:15} Therefore thus saith the LORD concerningthe prophets that prophesy in my name, and I sent them not, yet theysay, Sword and famine shall not be in this land; By sword and famineshall those prophets be consumed. 

{14:16} And the people to whom theyprophesy shall be cast out in the streets of Jerusalem because of thefamine and the sword; and they shall have none to bury them, them,their wives, nor their sons, nor their daughters: for I will pour theirwickedness upon them.   

{14:17} Therefore thou shalt say this word unto them; Let mine eyesrun down with tears night and day, and let them not cease: for thevirgin daughter of my people is broken with a great breach, with a verygrievous blow. 

{14:18} If I go forth into the field, then behold theslain with the sword! and if I enter into the city, then behold themthat are sick with famine! yea, both the prophet and the priest goabout into a land that they know not. 

{14:19} Hast thou utterlyrejected Judah? hath thy soul lothed Zion? why hast thou smitten us,and [there is] no healing for us? we looked for peace, and [there is]no good; and for the time of healing, and behold trouble! 

{14:20} Weacknowledge, O LORD, our wickedness, [and] the iniquity of our fathers:for we have sinned against thee. 

{14:21} Do not abhor [us,] for thyname's sake, do not disgrace the throne of thy glory: remember, breaknot thy covenant with us. 

{14:22} Are there [any] among the vanities ofthe Gentiles that can cause rain? or can the heavens give showers?[art] not thou he, O LORD our God? therefore we will wait upon thee:for thou hast made all these [things.]   

{15:1} Then said the LORD unto me, Though Moses and Samuel stoodbefore me, [yet] my mind [could] not [be] toward this people: cast[them] out of my sight, and let them go forth. 

{15:2} And it shall cometo pass, if they say unto thee, Whither shall we go forth? then thoushalt tell them, Thus saith the LORD; Such as [are] for death, todeath; and such as [are] for the sword, to the sword; and such as [are]for the famine, to the famine; and such as [are] for the captivity, tothe captivity. 

{15:3} And I will appoint over them four kinds, saiththe LORD: the sword to slay, and the dogs to tear, and the fowls of theheaven, and the beasts of the earth, to devour and destroy. 

{15:4} AndI will cause them to be removed into all kingdoms of the earth, becauseof Manasseh the son of Hezekiah king of Judah, for [that] which he didin Jerusalem. 

{15:5} For who shall have pity upon thee, O Jerusalem? orwho shall bemoan thee? or who shall go aside to ask how thou doest?

{15:6} Thou hast forsaken me, saith the LORD, thou art gone backward:therefore will I stretch out my hand against thee, and destroy thee; Iam weary with repenting. 

{15:7} And I will fan them with a fan in thegates of the land; I will bereave [them] of children, I will destroy mypeople, [since] they return not from their ways. 

{15:8} Their widowsare increased to me above the sand of the seas: I have brought uponthem against the mother of the young men a spoiler at noonday: I havecaused [him] to fall upon it suddenly, and terrors upon the city.

{15:9} She that hath borne seven languisheth: she hath given up theghost; her sun is gone down while [it was] yet day: she hath beenashamed and confounded: and the residue of them will I deliver to thesword before their enemies, saith the LORD.   

{15:10} Woe is me, my mother, that thou hast borne me a man ofstrife and a man of contention to the whole earth! I have neither lenton usury, nor men have lent to me on usury; [yet] every one of themdoth curse me. 

{15:11} The LORD said, Verily it shall be well with thyremnant; verily I will cause the enemy to entreat thee [well] in thetime of evil and in the time of affliction. 

{15:12} Shall iron breakthe northern iron and the steel? 

{15:13} Thy substance and thytreasures will I give to the spoil without price, and [that] for allthy sins, even in all thy borders. 

{15:14} And I will make [thee] topass with thine enemies into a land [which] thou knowest not: for afire is kindled in mine anger, [which] shall burn upon you.   

{15:15} O LORD, thou knowest: remember me, and visit me, and revengeme of my persecutors; take me not away in thy longsuffering: know thatfor thy sake I have suffered rebuke. 

{15:16} Thy words were found, andI did eat them; and thy word was unto me the joy and rejoicing of mineheart: for I am called by thy name, O LORD God of hosts. 

{15:17} I satnot in the assembly of the mockers, nor rejoiced; I sat alone becauseof thy hand: for thou hast filled me with indignation. 

{15:18} Why ismy pain perpetual, and my wound incurable, [which] refuseth to behealed? wilt thou be altogether unto me as a liar, [and as] waters[that] fail?   

{15:19} Therefore thus saith the LORD, If thou return, then will Ibring thee again, [and] thou shalt stand before me: and if thou takeforth the precious from the vile, thou shalt be as my mouth: let themreturn unto thee; but return not thou unto them. 

{15:20} And I willmake thee unto this people a fenced brasen wall: and they shall fightagainst thee, but they shall not prevail against thee: for I [am] withthee to save thee and to deliver thee, saith the LORD. 

{15:21} And Iwill deliver thee out of the hand of the wicked, and I will redeem theeout of the hand of the terrible.   

{16:1} The word of the LORD came also unto me, saying, 

{16:2} Thoushalt not take thee a wife, neither shalt thou have sons or daughtersin this place. 

{16:3} For thus saith the LORD concerning the sons andconcerning the daughters that are born in this place, and concerningtheir mothers that bare them, and concerning their fathers that begatthem in this land; 

{16:4} They shall die of grievous deaths; they shallnot be lamented; neither shall they be buried; [but] they shall be asdung upon the face of the earth: and they shall be consumed by thesword, and by famine; and their carcases shall be meat for the fowls ofheaven, and for the beasts of the earth. 

{16:5} For thus saith theLORD, Enter not into the house of mourning, neither go to lament norbemoan them: for I have taken away my peace from this people, saith theLORD, [even] lovingkindness and mercies. 

{16:6} Both the great and thesmall shall die in this land: they shall not be buried, neither shall[men] lament for them, nor cut themselves, nor make themselves bald forthem: 

{16:7} Neither shall [men] tear [themselves] for them inmourning, to comfort them for the dead; neither shall [men] give themthe cup of consolation to drink for their father or for their mother.

{16:8} Thou shalt not also go into the house of feasting, to sit withthem to eat and to drink. 

{16:9} For thus saith the LORD of hosts, theGod of Israel; Behold, I will cause to cease out of this place in youreyes, and in your days, the voice of mirth, and the voice of gladness,the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride.   

{16:10} And it shall come to pass, when thou shalt shew this peopleall these words, and they shall say unto thee, Wherefore hath the LORDpronounced all this great evil against us? or what [is] our iniquity?or what [is] our sin that we have committed against the LORD our God?

{16:11} Then shalt thou say unto them, Because your fathers haveforsaken me, saith the LORD, and have walked after other gods, and haveserved them, and have worshipped them, and have forsaken me, and havenot kept my law; 

{16:12} And ye have done worse than your fathers; for,behold, ye walk every one after the imagination of his evil heart, thatthey may not hearken unto me: 

{16:13} Therefore will I cast you out ofthis land into a land that ye know not, [neither] ye nor your fathers;and there shall ye serve other gods day and night; where I will notshew you favour.   

{16:14} Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that itshall no more be said, The LORD liveth, that brought up the children ofIsrael out of the land of Egypt; 

{16:15} But, The LORD liveth, thatbrought up the children of Israel from the land of the north, and fromall the lands whither he had driven them: and I will bring them againinto their land that I gave unto their fathers.   

{16:16} Behold, I will send for many fishers, saith the LORD, andthey shall fish them; and after will I send for many hunters, and theyshall hunt them from every mountain, and from every hill, and out ofthe holes of the rocks. 

{16:17} For mine eyes [are] upon all theirways: they are not hid from my face, neither is their iniquity hid frommine eyes. 

{16:18} And first I will recompense their iniquity and theirsin double; because they have defiled my land, they have filled mineinheritance with the carcases of their detestable and abominablethings. 

{16:19} O LORD, my strength, and my fortress, and my refuge inthe day of affliction, the Gentiles shall come unto thee from the endsof the earth, and shall say, Surely our fathers have inherited lies,vanity, and [things] wherein [there is] no profit. 

{16:20} Shall a manmake gods unto himself, and they [are] no gods? 

{16:21} Therefore,behold, I will this once cause them to know, I will cause them to knowmine hand and my might; and they shall know that my name [is] The LORD.   

{17:1} The sin of Judah [is] written with a pen of iron, [and] withthe point of a diamond: [it is] graven upon the table of their heart,and upon the horns of your altars; 

{17:2} Whilst their childrenremember their altars and their groves by the green trees upon the highhills. 

{17:3} O my mountain in the field, I will give thy substance[and] all thy treasures to the spoil, [and] thy high places for sin,throughout all thy borders. 

{17:4} And thou, even thyself, shaltdiscontinue from thine heritage that I gave thee; and I will cause theeto serve thine enemies in the land which thou knowest not: for ye havekindled a fire in mine anger, [which] shall burn for ever.   

{17:5} Thus saith the LORD; Cursed be the man that trusteth in man,and maketh flesh his arm, and whose heart departeth from the LORD.

{17:6} For he shall be like the heath in the desert, and shall not seewhen good cometh; but shall inhabit the parched places in thewilderness, [in] a salt land and not inhabited. 

{17:7} Blessed [is] theman that trusteth in the LORD, and whose hope the LORD is. 

{17:8} Forhe shall be as a tree planted by the waters, and [that] spreadeth outher roots by the river, and shall not see when heat cometh, but herleaf shall be green; and shall not be careful in the year of drought,neither shall cease from yielding fruit.   

{17:9} The heart [is] deceitful above all [things,] and desperatelywicked: who can know it? 

{17:10} I the LORD search the heart, [I] trythe reins, even to give every man according to his ways, [and]according to the fruit of his doings. 

{17:11} As the partridge sitteth[on eggs,] and hatcheth [them] not; [so] he that getteth riches, andnot by right, shall leave them in the midst of his days, and at his endshall be a fool.   

{17:12} A glorious high throne from the beginning [is] the place ofour sanctuary. 

{17:13} O LORD, the hope of Israel, all that forsakethee shall be ashamed, [and] they that depart from me shall be writtenin the earth, because they have forsaken the LORD, the fountain ofliving waters. 

{17:14} Heal me, O LORD, and I shall be healed; save me,and I shall be saved: for thou [art] my praise.   

{17:15} Behold, they say unto me, Where [is] the word of the LORD?let it come now. 

{17:16} As for me, I have not hastened from [being] apastor to follow thee: neither have I desired the woeful day; thouknowest: that which came out of my lips was [right] before thee.

{17:17} Be not a terror unto me: thou [art] my hope in the day of evil.

{17:18} Let them be confounded that persecute me, but let not me beconfounded: let them be dismayed, but let not me be dismayed: bringupon them the day of evil, and destroy them with double destruction.   

{17:19} Thus said the LORD unto me; Go and stand in the gate of thechildren of the people, whereby the kings of Judah come in, and by thewhich they go out, and in all the gates of Jerusalem; 

{17:20} And sayunto them, Hear ye the word of the LORD, ye kings of Judah, and allJudah, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, that enter in by thesegates: 

{17:21} Thus saith the LORD; Take heed to yourselves, and bearno burden on the sabbath day, nor bring [it] in by the gates ofJerusalem; 

{17:22} Neither carry forth a burden out of your houses onthe sabbath day, neither do ye any work, but hallow ye the sabbath day,as I commanded your fathers. 

{17:23} But they obeyed not, neitherinclined their ear, but made their neck stiff, that they might nothear, nor receive instruction. 

{17:24} And it shall come to pass, if yediligently hearken unto me, saith the LORD, to bring in no burdenthrough the gates of this city on the sabbath day, but hallow thesabbath day, to do no work therein; 

{17:25} Then shall there enter intothe gates of this city kings and princes sitting upon the throne ofDavid, riding in chariots and on horses, they, and their princes, themen of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem: and this city shallremain for ever. 

{17:26} And they shall come from the cities of Judah,and from the places about Jerusalem, and from the land of Benjamin, andfrom the plain, and from the mountains, and from the south, bringingburnt offerings, and sacrifices, and meat offerings, and incense, andbringing sacrifices of praise, unto the house of the LORD. 

{17:27} Butif ye will not hearken unto me to hallow the sabbath day, and not tobear a burden, even entering in at the gates of Jerusalem on thesabbath day; then will I kindle a fire in the gates thereof, and itshall devour the palaces of Jerusalem, and it shall not be quenched.   

{18:1} The word which came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying, 

{18:2}Arise, and go down to the potter's house, and there I will cause theeto hear my words. 

{18:3} Then I went down to the potter's house, and,behold, he wrought a work on the wheels. 

{18:4} And the vessel that hemade of clay was marred in the hand of the potter: so he made it againanother vessel, as seemed good to the potter to make [it. ]

{18:5} Thenthe word of the LORD came to me, saying, 

{18:6} O house of Israel,cannot I do with you as this potter? saith the LORD. Behold, as theclay [is] in the potter's hand, so [are] ye in mine hand, O house ofIsrael. 

{18:7} [At what] instant I shall speak concerning a nation, andconcerning a kingdom, to pluck up, and to pull down, and to destroy[it; ]

{18:8} If that nation, against whom I have pronounced, turn fromtheir evil, I will repent of the evil that I thought to do unto them.

{18:9} And [at what] instant I shall speak concerning a nation, andconcerning a kingdom, to build and to plant [it; ]

{18:10} If it do evilin my sight, that it obey not my voice, then I will repent of the good,wherewith I said I would benefit them.   

{18:11} Now therefore go to, speak to the men of Judah, and to theinhabitants of Jerusalem, saying, Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I frameevil against you, and devise a device against you: return ye now everyone from his evil way, and make your ways and your doings good. 

{18:12}And they said, There is no hope: but we will walk after our owndevices, and we will every one do the imagination of his evil heart.

{18:13} Therefore thus saith the LORD; Ask ye now among the heathen,who hath heard such things: the virgin of Israel hath done a veryhorrible thing. 

{18:14} Will [a man] leave the snow of Lebanon [whichcometh] from the rock of the field? [or] shall the cold flowing watersthat come from another place be forsaken? 

{18:15} Because my peoplehath forgotten me, they have burned incense to vanity, and they havecaused them to stumble in their ways [from] the ancient paths, to walkin paths, [in] a way not cast up; 

{18:16} To make their land desolate,[and] a perpetual hissing; every one that passeth thereby shall beastonished, and wag his head. 

{18:17} I will scatter them as with aneast wind before the enemy; I will shew them the back, and not theface, in the day of their calamity.   

{18:18} Then said they, Come, and let us devise devices againstJeremiah; for the law shall not perish from the priest, nor counselfrom the wise, nor the word from the prophet. Come, and let us smitehim with the tongue, and let us not give heed to any of his words.

{18:19} Give heed to me, O LORD, and hearken to the voice of them thatcontend with me. 

{18:20} Shall evil be recompensed for good? for theyhave digged a pit for my soul. Remember that I stood before thee tospeak good for them, [and] to turn away thy wrath from them. 

{18:21}Therefore deliver up their children to the famine, and pour out their[blood] by the force of the sword; and let their wives be bereaved oftheir children, and [be] widows; and let their men be put to death;[let] their young men [be] slain by the sword in battle. 

{18:22} Let acry be heard from their houses, when thou shalt bring a troop suddenlyupon them: for they have digged a pit to take me, and hid snares for myfeet. 

{18:23} Yet, LORD, thou knowest all their counsel against me toslay [me:] forgive not their iniquity, neither blot out their sin fromthy sight, but let them be overthrown before thee; deal [thus] withthem in the time of thine anger.   

{19:1} Thus saith the LORD, Go and get a potter's earthen bottle,and [take] of the ancients of the people, and of the ancients of thepriests; 

{19:2} And go forth unto the valley of the son of Hinnom,which [is] by the entry of the east gate, and proclaim there the wordsthat I shall tell thee, 

{19:3} And say, Hear ye the word of the LORD, Okings of Judah, and inhabitants of Jerusalem; Thus saith the LORD ofhosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will bring evil upon this place,the which whosoever heareth, his ears shall tingle. 

{19:4} Because theyhave forsaken me, and have estranged this place, and have burnedincense in it unto other gods, whom neither they nor their fathers haveknown, nor the kings of Judah, and have filled this place with theblood of innocents; 

{19:5} They have built also the high places ofBaal, to burn their sons with fire [for] burnt offerings unto Baal,which I commanded not, nor spake [it,] neither came [it] into my mind:

{19:6} Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that thisplace shall no more be called Tophet, nor The valley of the son ofHinnom, but The valley of slaughter. 

{19:7} And I will make void thecounsel of Judah and Jerusalem in this place; and I will cause them tofall by the sword before their enemies, and by the hands of them thatseek their lives: and their carcases will I give to be meat for thefowls of the heaven, and for the beasts of the earth. 

{19:8} And I willmake this city desolate, and an hissing; every one that passeth therebyshall be astonished and hiss because of all the plagues thereof. 

{19:9}And I will cause them to eat the flesh of their sons and the flesh oftheir daughters, and they shall eat every one the flesh of his friendin the siege and straitness, wherewith their enemies, and they thatseek their lives, shall straiten them. 

{19:10} Then shalt thou breakthe bottle in the sight of the men that go with thee, 

{19:11} And shaltsay unto them, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Even so will I break thispeople and this city, as [one] breaketh a potter's vessel, that cannotbe made whole again: and they shall bury [them] in Tophet, till [therebe] no place to bury. 

{19:12} Thus will I do unto this place, saith theLORD, and to the inhabitants thereof, and [even] make this city asTophet: 

{19:13} And the houses of Jerusalem, and the houses of thekings of Judah, shall be defiled as the place of Tophet, because of allthe houses upon whose roofs they have burned incense unto all the hostof heaven, and have poured out drink offerings unto other gods. 

{19:14}Then came Jeremiah from Tophet, whither the LORD had sent him toprophesy; and he stood in the court of the LORD'S house; and said toall the people, 

{19:15} Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God ofIsrael; Behold, I will bring upon this city and upon all her towns allthe evil that I have pronounced against it, because they have hardenedtheir necks, that they might not hear my words.   

{20:1} Now Pashur the son of Immer the priest, who [was] also chiefgovernor in the house of the LORD, heard that Jeremiah prophesied thesethings. 

{20:2} Then Pashur smote Jeremiah the prophet, and put him inthe stocks that [were] in the high gate of Benjamin, which [was] by thehouse of the LORD. 

{20:3} And it came to pass on the morrow, thatPashur brought forth Jeremiah out of the stocks. Then said Jeremiahunto him, The LORD hath not called thy name Pashur, but Magor-missabib.

{20:4} For thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will make thee a terror tothyself, and to all thy friends: and they shall fall by the sword oftheir enemies, and thine eyes shall behold [it:] and I will give allJudah into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall carry themcaptive into Babylon, and shall slay them with the sword. 

{20:5}Moreover I will deliver all the strength of this city, and all thelabours thereof, and all the precious things thereof, and all thetreasures of the kings of Judah will I give into the hand of theirenemies, which shall spoil them, and take them, and carry them toBabylon. 

{20:6} And thou, Pashur, and all that dwell in thine houseshall go into captivity: and thou shalt come to Babylon, and there thoushalt die, and shalt be buried there, thou, and all thy friends, towhom thou hast prophesied lies.   

{20:7} O LORD, thou hast deceived me, and I was deceived: thou artstronger than I, and hast prevailed: I am in derision daily, every onemocketh me. 

{20:8} For since I spake, I cried out, I cried violence andspoil; because the word of the LORD was made a reproach unto me, and aderision, daily. 

{20:9} Then I said, I will not make mention of him,nor speak any more in his name. But [his word] was in mine heart as aburning fire shut up in my bones, and I was weary with forbearing, andI could not [stay.]   

{20:10} For I heard the defaming of many, fear on every side.Report, [say they,] and we will report it. All my familiars watched formy halting, [saying,] Peradventure he will be enticed, and we shallprevail against him, and we shall take our revenge on him. 

{20:11} Butthe LORD [is] with me as a mighty terrible one: therefore mypersecutors shall stumble, and they shall not prevail: they shall begreatly ashamed; for they shall not prosper: [their] everlastingconfusion shall never be forgotten. 

{20:12} But, O LORD of hosts, thattriest the righteous, [and] seest the reins and the heart, let me seethy vengeance on them: for unto thee have I opened my cause. 

{20:13}Sing unto the LORD, praise ye the LORD: for he hath delivered the soulof the poor from the hand of evildoers.   

{20:14} Cursed [be] the day wherein I was born: let not the daywherein my mother bare me be blessed. 

{20:15} Cursed [be] the man whobrought tidings to my father, saying, A man child is born unto thee;making him very glad. 

{20:16} And let that man be as the cities whichthe LORD overthrew, and repented not: and let him hear the cry in themorning, and the shouting at noontide; 

{20:17} Because he slew me notfrom the womb; or that my mother might have been my grave, and her womb[to be] always great [with me. ]

{20:18} Wherefore came I forth out ofthe womb to see labour and sorrow, that my days should be consumed withshame?   

{21:1} The word which came unto Jeremiah from the LORD, when kingZedekiah sent unto him Pashur the son of Melchiah, and Zephaniah theson of Maaseiah the priest, saying, 

{21:2} Enquire, I pray thee, of theLORD for us; for Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon maketh war against us;if so be that the LORD will deal with us according to all his wondrousworks, that he may go up from us. 

{21:3} Then said Jeremiah unto them,Thus shall ye say to Zedekiah: 

{21:4} Thus saith the LORD God ofIsrael; Behold, I will turn back the weapons of war that [are] in yourhands, wherewith ye fight [against] the king of Babylon, and againstthe Chaldeans, which besiege you without the walls, and I will assemblethem into the midst of this city. 

{21:5} And I myself will fightagainst you with an outstretched hand and with a strong arm, even inanger, and in fury, and in great wrath. 

{21:6} And I will smite theinhabitants of this city, both man and beast: they shall die of a greatpestilence. 

{21:7} And afterward, saith the LORD, I will deliverZedekiah king of Judah, and his servants, and the people, and such asare left in this city from the pestilence, from the sword, and from thefamine, into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and into thehand of their enemies, and into the hand of those that seek their life:and he shall smite them with the edge of the sword; he shall not sparethem, neither have pity, nor have mercy.   

{21:8} And unto this people thou shalt say, Thus saith the LORD;Behold, I set before you the way of life, and the way of death. 

{21:9}He that abideth in this city shall die by the sword, and by the famine,and by the pestilence: but he that goeth out, and falleth to theChaldeans that besiege you, he shall live, and his life shall be untohim for a prey. 

{21:10} For I have set my face against this city forevil, and not for good, saith the LORD: it shall be given into the handof the king of Babylon, and he shall burn it with fire.   

{21:11} And touching the house of the king of Judah, say, Hear yethe word of the LORD; 

{21:12} O house of David, thus saith the LORD;Execute judgment in the morning, and deliver [him that is] spoiled outof the hand of the oppressor, lest my fury go out like fire, and burnthat none can quench [it,] because of the evil of your doings. 

{21:13}Behold, I [am] against thee, O inhabitant of the valley, [and] rock ofthe plain, saith the LORD; which say, Who shall come down against us?or who shall enter into our habitations? 

{21:14} But I will punish youaccording to the fruit of your doings, saith the LORD: and I willkindle a fire in the forest thereof, and it shall devour all thingsround about it.   

{22:1} Thus saith the LORD; Go down to the house of the king ofJudah, and speak there this word, 

{22:2} And say, Hear the word of theLORD, O king of Judah, that sittest upon the throne of David, thou, andthy servants, and thy people that enter in by these gates: 

{22:3} Thussaith the LORD; Execute ye judgment and righteousness, and deliver thespoiled out of the hand of the oppressor: and do no wrong, do noviolence to the stranger, the fatherless, nor the widow, neither shedinnocent blood in this place. 

{22:4} For if ye do this thing indeed,then shall there enter in by the gates of this house kings sitting uponthe throne of David, riding in chariots and on horses, he, and hisservants, and his people. 

{22:5} But if ye will not hear these words, Iswear by myself, saith the LORD, that this house shall become adesolation. 

{22:6} For thus saith the LORD unto the king's house ofJudah; Thou [art] Gilead unto me, [and] the head of Lebanon: [yet]surely I will make thee a wilderness, [and] cities [which] are notinhabited. 

{22:7} And I will prepare destroyers against thee, every onewith his weapons: and they shall cut down thy choice cedars, and cast[them] into the fire. 

{22:8} And many nations shall pass by this city,and they shall say every man to his neighbour, Wherefore hath the LORDdone thus unto this great city? 

{22:9} Then they shall answer, Becausethey have forsaken the covenant of the LORD their God, and worshippedother gods, and served them.   

{22:10} Weep ye not for the dead, neither bemoan him: [but] weepsore for him that goeth away: for he shall return no more, nor see hisnative country. 

{22:11} For thus saith the LORD touching Shallum theson of Josiah king of Judah, which reigned instead of Josiah hisfather, which went forth out of this place; He shall not return thitherany more: 

{22:12} But he shall die in the place whither they have ledhim captive, and shall see this land no more.   

{22:13} Woe unto him that buildeth his house by unrighteousness, andhis chambers by wrong; [that] useth his neighbour's service withoutwages, and giveth him not for his work; 

{22:14} That saith, I willbuild me a wide house and large chambers, and cutteth him out windows;and [it is] cieled with cedar, and painted with vermilion. 

{22:15}Shalt thou reign, because thou closest [thyself] in cedar? did not thyfather eat and drink, and do judgment and justice, [and] then [it was]well with him? 

{22:16} He judged the cause of the poor and needy; then[it was] well [with him: was] not this to know me? saith the LORD.

{22:17} But thine eyes and thine heart [are] not but for thycovetousness, and for to shed innocent blood, and for oppression, andfor violence, to do [it. ]

{22:18} Therefore thus saith the LORDconcerning Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah; They shall notlament for him, [saying,] Ah my brother! or, Ah sister! they shall notlament for him, [saying,] Ah lord! or, Ah his glory! 

{22:19} He shallbe buried with the burial of an ass, drawn and cast forth beyond thegates of Jerusalem.   

{22:20} Go up to Lebanon, and cry; and lift up thy voice in Bashan,and cry from the passages: for all thy lovers are destroyed. 

{22:21} Ispake unto thee in thy prosperity; [but] thou saidst, I will not hear.This [hath been] thy manner from thy youth, that thou obeyedst not myvoice. 

{22:22} The wind shall eat up all thy pastors, and thy loversshall go into captivity: surely then shalt thou be ashamed andconfounded for all thy wickedness. 

{22:23} O inhabitant of Lebanon,that makest thy nest in the cedars, how gracious shalt thou be whenpangs come upon thee, the pain as of a woman in travail! 

{22:24} [As] Ilive, saith the LORD, though Coniah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judahwere the signet upon my right hand, yet would I pluck thee thence;

{22:25} And I will give thee into the hand of them that seek thy life,and into the hand [of them] whose face thou fearest, even into the handof Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand of the Chaldeans.

{22:26} And I will cast thee out, and thy mother that bare thee, intoanother country, where ye were not born; and there shall ye die.

{22:27} But to the land whereunto they desire to return, thither shallthey not return. 

{22:28} [Is] this man Coniah a despised broken idol?[is he] a vessel wherein [is] no pleasure? wherefore are they cast out,he and his seed, and are cast into a land which they know not? 

{22:29}O earth, earth, earth, hear the word of the LORD. 

{22:30} Thus saiththe LORD, Write ye this man childless, a man [that] shall not prosperin his days: for no man of his seed shall prosper, sitting upon thethrone of David, and ruling any more in Judah.   

{23:1} Woe be unto the pastors that destroy and scatter the sheep ofmy pasture! saith the LORD. 

{23:2} Therefore thus saith the LORD God ofIsrael against the pastors that feed my people; Ye have scattered myflock, and driven them away, and have not visited them: behold, I willvisit upon you the evil of your doings, saith the LORD. 

{23:3} And Iwill gather the remnant of my flock out of all countries whither I havedriven them, and will bring them again to their folds; and they shallbe fruitful and increase. 

{23:4} And I will set up shepherds over themwhich shall feed them: and they shall fear no more, nor be dismayed,neither shall they be lacking, saith the LORD.   

{23:5} Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will raise untoDavid a righteous Branch, and a King shall reign and prosper, and shallexecute judgment and justice in the earth. 

{23:6} In his days Judahshall be saved, and Israel shall dwell safely: and this [is] his namewhereby he shall be called, THE LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS. 

{23:7}Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that they shall nomore say, The LORD liveth, which brought up the children of Israel outof the land of Egypt; 

{23:8} But, The LORD liveth, which brought up andwhich led the seed of the house of Israel out of the north country, andfrom all countries whither I had driven them; and they shall dwell intheir own land.   

{23:9} Mine heart within me is broken because of the prophets; allmy bones shake; I am like a drunken man, and like a man whom wine hathovercome, because of the LORD, and because of the words of hisholiness. 

{23:10} For the land is full of adulterers; for because ofswearing the land mourneth; the pleasant places of the wilderness aredried up, and their course is evil, and their force [is] not right.

{23:11} For both prophet and priest are profane; yea, in my house haveI found their wickedness, saith the LORD. 

{23:12} Wherefore their wayshall be unto them as slippery [ways] in the darkness: they shall bedriven on, and fall therein: for I will bring evil upon them, [even]the year of their visitation, saith the LORD. 

{23:13} And I have seenfolly in the prophets of Samaria; they prophesied in Baal, and causedmy people Israel to err. 

{23:14} I have seen also in the prophets ofJerusalem an horrible thing: they commit adultery, and walk in lies:they strengthen also the hands of evildoers, that none doth return fromhis wickedness: they are all of them unto me as Sodom, and theinhabitants thereof as Gomorrah. 

{23:15} Therefore thus saith the LORDof hosts concerning the prophets; Behold, I will feed them withwormwood, and make them drink the water of gall: for from the prophetsof Jerusalem is profaneness gone forth into all the land. 

{23:16} Thussaith the LORD of hosts, Hearken not unto the words of the prophetsthat prophesy unto you: they make you vain: they speak a vision oftheir own heart, [and] not out of the mouth of the LORD. 

{23:17} Theysay still unto them that despise me, The LORD hath said, Ye shall havepeace; and they say unto every one that walketh after the imaginationof his own heart, No evil shall come upon you. 

{23:18} For who hathstood in the counsel of the LORD, and hath perceived and heard hisword? who hath marked his word, and heard [it? ]

{23:19} Behold, awhirlwind of the LORD is gone forth in fury, even a grievous whirlwind:it shall fall grievously upon the head of the wicked. 

{23:20} The angerof the LORD shall not return, until he have executed, and till he haveperformed the thoughts of his heart: in the latter days ye shallconsider it perfectly. 

{23:21} I have not sent these prophets, yet theyran: I have not spoken to them, yet they prophesied. 

{23:22} But ifthey had stood in my counsel, and had caused my people to hear mywords, then they should have turned them from their evil way, and fromthe evil of their doings. 

{23:23} [Am] I a God at hand, saith the LORD,and not a God afar off? 

{23:24} Can any hide himself in secret placesthat I shall not see him? saith the LORD. Do not I fill heaven andearth? saith the LORD. 

{23:25} I have heard what the prophets said,that prophesy lies in my name, saying, I have dreamed, I have dreamed.

{23:26} How long shall [this] be in the heart of the prophets thatprophesy lies? yea, [they are] prophets of the deceit of their ownheart; 

{23:27} Which think to cause my people to forget my name bytheir dreams which they tell every man to his neighbour, as theirfathers have forgotten my name for Baal. 

{23:28} The prophet that hatha dream, let him tell a dream; and he that hath my word, let him speakmy word faithfully. What [is] the chaff to the wheat? saith the LORD.

{23:29} [Is] not my word like as a fire? saith the LORD; and like ahammer [that] breaketh the rock in pieces? 

{23:30} Therefore, behold, I[am] against the prophets, saith the LORD, that steal my words everyone from his neighbour. 

{23:31} Behold, I [am] against the prophets,saith the LORD, that use their tongues, and say, He saith. 

{23:32}Behold, I [am] against them that prophesy false dreams, saith the LORD,and do tell them, and cause my people to err by their lies, and bytheir lightness; yet I sent them not, nor commanded them: thereforethey shall not profit this people at all, saith the LORD.   

{23:33} And when this people, or the prophet, or a priest, shall askthee, saying, What [is] the burden of the LORD? thou shalt then sayunto them, What burden? I will even forsake you, saith the LORD.

{23:34} And [as for] the prophet, and the priest, and the people, thatshall say, The burden of the LORD, I will even punish that man and hishouse. 

{23:35} Thus shall ye say every one to his neighbour, and everyone to his brother, What hath the LORD answered? and, What hath theLORD spoken? 

{23:36} And the burden of the LORD shall ye mention nomore: for every man's word shall be his burden; for ye have pervertedthe words of the living God, of the LORD of hosts our God. 

{23:37} Thusshalt thou say to the prophet, What hath the LORD answered thee? and,What hath the LORD spoken? 

{23:38} But since ye say, The burden of theLORD; therefore thus saith the LORD; Because ye say this word, Theburden of the LORD, and I have sent unto you, saying, Ye shall not say,The burden of the LORD; 

{23:39} Therefore, behold, I, even I, willutterly forget you, and I will forsake you, and the city that I gaveyou and your fathers, [and cast you] out of my presence: 

{23:40} And Iwill bring an everlasting reproach upon you, and a perpetual shame,which shall not be forgotten.   

{24:1} The LORD shewed me, and, behold, two baskets of figs [were]set before the temple of the LORD, after that Nebuchadrezzar king ofBabylon had carried away captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim king ofJudah, and the princes of Judah, with the carpenters and smiths, fromJerusalem, and had brought them to Babylon. 

{24:2} One basket [had]very good figs, [even] like the figs [that are] first ripe: and theother basket [had] very naughty figs, which could not be eaten, theywere so bad. 

{24:3} Then said the LORD unto me, What seest thou,Jeremiah? And I said, Figs; the good figs, very good; and the evil,very evil, that cannot be eaten, they are so evil.   

{24:4} Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 

{24:5} Thussaith the LORD, the God of Israel; Like these good figs, so will Iacknowledge them that are carried away captive of Judah, whom I havesent out of this place into the land of the Chaldeans for [their] good.

{24:6} For I will set mine eyes upon them for good, and I will bringthem again to this land: and I will build them, and not pull [them]down; and I will plant them, and not pluck [them] up. 

{24:7} And I willgive them an heart to know me, that I [am] the LORD: and they shall bemy people, and I will be their God: for they shall return unto me withtheir whole heart.   

{24:8} And as the evil figs, which cannot be eaten, they are soevil; surely thus saith the LORD, So will I give Zedekiah the king ofJudah, and his princes, and the residue of Jerusalem, that remain inthis land, and them that dwell in the land of Egypt: 

{24:9} And I willdeliver them to be removed into all the kingdoms of the earth for[their] hurt, [to be] a reproach and a proverb, a taunt and a curse, inall places whither I shall drive them. 

{24:10} And I will send thesword, the famine, and the pestilence, among them, till they beconsumed from off the land that I gave unto them and to their fathers.   

{25:1} The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the people ofJudah in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah,that [was] the first year of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon; 

{25:2} Thewhich Jeremiah the prophet spake unto all the people of Judah, and toall the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying, 

{25:3} From the thirteenthyear of Josiah the son of Amon king of Judah, even unto this day, that[is] the three and twentieth year, the word of the LORD hath come untome, and I have spoken unto you, rising early and speaking; but ye havenot hearkened. 

{25:4} And the LORD hath sent unto you all his servantsthe prophets, rising early and sending [them;] but ye have nothearkened, nor inclined your ear to hear. 

{25:5} They said, Turn yeagain now every one from his evil way, and from the evil of yourdoings, and dwell in the land that the LORD hath given unto you and toyour fathers for ever and ever: 

{25:6} And go not after other gods toserve them, and to worship them, and provoke me not to anger with theworks of your hands; and I will do you no hurt. 

{25:7} Yet ye have nothearkened unto me, saith the LORD; that ye might provoke me to angerwith the works of your hands to your own hurt.   

{25:8} Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts; Because ye have notheard my words, 

{25:9} Behold, I will send and take all the families ofthe north, saith the LORD, and Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon, myservant, and will bring them against this land, and against theinhabitants thereof, and against all these nations round about, andwill utterly destroy them, and make them an astonishment, and anhissing, and perpetual desolations. 

{25:10} Moreover I will take fromthem the voice of mirth, and the voice of gladness, the voice of thebridegroom, and the voice of the bride, the sound of the millstones,and the light of the candle. 

{25:11} And this whole land shall be adesolation, [and] an astonishment; and these nations shall serve theking of Babylon seventy years.   

{25:12} And it shall come to pass, when seventy years areaccomplished, [that] I will punish the king of Babylon, and thatnation, saith the LORD, for their iniquity, and the land of theChaldeans, and will make it perpetual desolations. 

{25:13} And I willbring upon that land all my words which I have pronounced against it,[even] all that is written in this book, which Jeremiah hath prophesiedagainst all the nations. 

{25:14} For many nations and great kings shallserve themselves of them also: and I will recompense them according totheir deeds, and according to the works of their own hands.   

{25:15} For thus saith the LORD God of Israel unto me; Take the winecup of this fury at my hand, and cause all the nations, to whom I sendthee, to drink it. 

{25:16} And they shall drink, and be moved, and bemad, because of the sword that I will send among them. 

{25:17} Thentook I the cup at the LORD'S hand, and made all the nations to drink,unto whom the LORD had sent me: 

{25:18} [To wit,] Jerusalem, and thecities of Judah, and the kings thereof, and the princes thereof, tomake them a desolation, an astonishment, an hissing, and a curse; as[it is] this day; 

{25:19} Pharaoh king of Egypt, and his servants, andhis princes, and all his people; 

{25:20} And all the mingled people,and all the kings of the land of Uz, and all the kings of the land ofthe Philistines, and Ashkelon, and Azzah, and Ekron, and the remnant ofAshdod, 

{25:21} Edom, and Moab, and the children of Ammon, 

{25:22} Andall the kings of Tyrus, and all the kings of Zidon, and the kings ofthe isles which are beyond the sea, 

{25:23} Dedan, and Tema, and Buz,and all [that are] in the utmost corners, 

{25:24} And all the kings ofArabia, and all the kings of the mingled people that dwell in thedesert, 

{25:25} And all the kings of Zimri, and all the kings of Elam,and all the kings of the Medes, 

{25:26} And all the kings of the north,far and near, one with another, and all the kingdoms of the world,which [are] upon the face of the earth: and the king of Sheshach shalldrink after them. 

{25:27} Therefore thou shalt say unto them, Thussaith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Drink ye, and be drunken,and spue, and fall, and rise no more, because of the sword which I willsend among you. 

{25:28} And it shall be, if they refuse to take the cupat thine hand to drink, then shalt thou say unto them, Thus saith theLORD of hosts; Ye shall certainly drink. 

{25:29} For, lo, I begin tobring evil on the city which is called by my name, and should ye beutterly unpunished? Ye shall not be unpunished: for I will call for asword upon all the inhabitants of the earth, saith the LORD of hosts.

{25:30} Therefore prophesy thou against them all these words, and sayunto them, The LORD shall roar from on high, and utter his voice fromhis holy habitation; he shall mightily roar upon his habitation; heshall give a shout, as they that tread [the grapes,] against all theinhabitants of the earth. 

{25:31} A noise shall come [even] to the endsof the earth; for the LORD hath a controversy with the nations, he willplead with all flesh; he will give them [that are] wicked to the sword,saith the LORD. 

{25:32} Thus saith the LORD of hosts, Behold, evilshall go forth from nation to nation, and a great whirlwind shall beraised up from the coasts of the earth. 

{25:33} And the slain of theLORD shall be at that day from [one] end of the earth even unto the[other] end of the earth: they shall not be lamented, neither gathered,nor buried; they shall be dung upon the ground.   

{25:34} Howl, ye shepherds, and cry; and wallow yourselves [in theashes,] ye principal of the flock: for the days of your slaughter andof your dispersions are accomplished; and ye shall fall like a pleasantvessel. 

{25:35} And the shepherds shall have no way to flee, nor theprincipal of the flock to escape. 

{25:36} A voice of the cry of theshepherds, and an howling of the principal of the flock, [shall beheard:] for the LORD hath spoiled their pasture. 

{25:37} And thepeaceable habitations are cut down because of the fierce anger of theLORD. 

{25:38} He hath forsaken his covert, as the lion: for their landis desolate because of the fierceness of the oppressor, and because ofhis fierce anger.   

{26:1} In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiahking of Judah came this word from the LORD, saying, 

{26:2} Thus saiththe LORD; Stand in the court of the LORD'S house, and speak unto allthe cities of Judah, which come to worship in the LORD'S house, all thewords that I command thee to speak unto them; diminish not a word:

{26:3} If so be they will hearken, and turn every man from his evilway, that I may repent me of the evil, which I purpose to do unto thembecause of the evil of their doings. 

{26:4} And thou shalt say untothem, Thus saith the LORD; If ye will not hearken to me, to walk in mylaw, which I have set before you, 

{26:5} To hearken to the words of myservants the prophets, whom I sent unto you, both rising up early, andsending [them,] but ye have not hearkened; 

{26:6} Then will I make thishouse like Shiloh, and will make this city a curse to all the nationsof the earth. 

{26:7} So the priests and the prophets and all the peopleheard Jeremiah speaking these words in the house of the LORD.   

{26:8} Now it came to pass, when Jeremiah had made an end ofspeaking all that the LORD had commanded [him] to speak unto all thepeople, that the priests and the prophets and all the people took him,saying, Thou shalt surely die. 

{26:9} Why hast thou prophesied in thename of the LORD, saying, This house shall be like Shiloh, and thiscity shall be desolate without an inhabitant? And all the people weregathered against Jeremiah in the house of the LORD.   

{26:10} When the princes of Judah heard these things, then they cameup from the king's house unto the house of the LORD, and sat down inthe entry of the new gate of the LORD'S [house. ]

{26:11} Then spake thepriests and the prophets unto the princes and to all the people,saying, This man [is] worthy to die; for he hath prophesied againstthis city, as ye have heard with your ears.   

{26:12} Then spake Jeremiah unto all the princes and to all thepeople, saying, The LORD sent me to prophesy against this house andagainst this city all the words that ye have heard. 

{26:13} Thereforenow amend your ways and your doings, and obey the voice of the LORDyour God; and the LORD will repent him of the evil that he hathpronounced against you. 

{26:14} As for me, behold, I [am] in your hand:do with me as seemeth good and meet unto you. 

{26:15} But know ye forcertain, that if ye put me to death, ye shall surely bring innocentblood upon yourselves, and upon this city, and upon the inhabitantsthereof: for of a truth the LORD hath sent me unto you to speak allthese words in your ears.   

{26:16} Then said the princes and all the people unto the priestsand to the prophets; This man [is] not worthy to die: for he hathspoken to us in the name of the LORD our God. 

{26:17} Then rose upcertain of the elders of the land, and spake to all the assembly of thepeople, saying, 

{26:18} Micah the Morasthite prophesied in the days ofHezekiah king of Judah, and spake to all the people of Judah, saying,Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Zion shall be plowed [like] a field, andJerusalem shall become heaps, and the mountain of the house as the highplaces of a forest. 

{26:19} Did Hezekiah king of Judah and all Judahput him at all to death? did he not fear the LORD, and besought theLORD, and the LORD repented him of the evil which he had pronouncedagainst them? Thus might we procure great evil against our souls.

{26:20} And there was also a man that prophesied in the name of theLORD, Urijah the son of Shemaiah of Kirjath-jearim, who prophesiedagainst this city and against this land according to all the words ofJeremiah: 

{26:21} And when Jehoiakim the king, with all his mighty men,and all the princes, heard his words, the king sought to put him todeath: but when Urijah heard it, he was afraid, and fled, and went intoEgypt; 

{26:22} And Jehoiakim the king sent men into Egypt, [namely,]Elnathan the son of Achbor, and [certain] men with him into Egypt.

{26:23} And they fetched forth Urijah out of Egypt, and brought himunto Jehoiakim the king; who slew him with the sword, and cast his deadbody into the graves of the common people. 

{26:24} Nevertheless thehand of Ahikam the son of Shaphan was with Jeremiah, that they shouldnot give him into the hand of the people to put him to death.   

{27:1} In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiahking of Judah came this word unto Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,

{27:2} Thus saith the LORD to me; Make thee bonds and yokes, and putthem upon thy neck, 

{27:3} And send them to the king of Edom, and tothe king of Moab, and to the king of the Ammonites, and to the king ofTyrus, and to the king of Zidon, by the hand of the messengers whichcome to Jerusalem unto Zedekiah king of Judah; 

{27:4} And command themto say unto their masters, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God ofIsrael; Thus shall ye say unto your masters; 

{27:5} I have made theearth, the man and the beast that [are] upon the ground, by my greatpower and by my outstretched arm, and have given it unto whom it seemedmeet unto me. 

{27:6} And now have I given all these lands into the handof Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, my servant; and the beasts ofthe field have I given him also to serve him. 

{27:7} And all nationsshall serve him, and his son, and his son's son, until the very time ofhis land come: and then many nations and great kings shall servethemselves of him. 

{27:8} And it shall come to pass, [that] the nationand kingdom which will not serve the same Nebuchadnezzar the king ofBabylon, and that will not put their neck under the yoke of the king ofBabylon, that nation will I punish, saith the LORD, with the sword, andwith the famine, and with the pestilence, until I have consumed them byhis hand. 

{27:9} Therefore hearken not ye to your prophets, nor to yourdiviners, nor to your dreamers, nor to your enchanters, nor to yoursorcerers, which speak unto you, saying, Ye shall not serve the king ofBabylon: 

{27:10} For they prophesy a lie unto you, to remove you farfrom your land; and that I should drive you out, and ye should perish.

{27:11} But the nations that bring their neck under the yoke of theking of Babylon, and serve him, those will I let remain still in theirown land, saith the LORD; and they shall till it, and dwell therein.   

{27:12} I spake also to Zedekiah king of Judah according to allthese words, saying, Bring your necks under the yoke of the king ofBabylon, and serve him and his people, and live. 

{27:13} Why will yedie, thou and thy people, by the sword, by the famine, and by thepestilence, as the LORD hath spoken against the nation that will notserve the king of Babylon? 

{27:14} Therefore hearken not unto the wordsof the prophets that speak unto you, saying, Ye shall not serve theking of Babylon: for they prophesy a lie unto you. 

{27:15} For I havenot sent them, saith the LORD, yet they prophesy a lie in my name; thatI might drive you out, and that ye might perish, ye, and the prophetsthat prophesy unto you. 

{27:16} Also I spake to the priests and to allthis people, saying, Thus saith the LORD; Hearken not to the words ofyour prophets that prophesy unto you, saying, Behold, the vessels ofthe LORD'S house shall now shortly be brought again from Babylon: forthey prophesy a lie unto you. 

{27:17} Hearken not unto them; serve theking of Babylon, and live: wherefore should this city be laid waste?

{27:18} But if they [be] prophets, and if the word of the LORD be withthem, let them now make intercession to the LORD of hosts, that thevessels which are left in the house of the LORD, and [in] the house ofthe king of Judah, and at Jerusalem, go not to Babylon.   

{27:19} For thus saith the LORD of hosts concerning the pillars, andconcerning the sea, and concerning the bases, and concerning theresidue of the vessels that remain in this city, 

{27:20} WhichNebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took not, when he carried away captiveJeconiah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah from Jerusalem to Babylon,and all the nobles of Judah and Jerusalem; 

{27:21} Yea, thus saith theLORD of hosts, the God of Israel, concerning the vessels that remain[in] the house of the LORD, and [in] the house of the king of Judah andof Jerusalem; 

{27:22} They shall be carried to Babylon, and there shallthey be until the day that I visit them, saith the LORD; then will Ibring them up, and restore them to this place.   

{28:1} And it came to pass the same year, in the beginning of thereign of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the fourth year, [and] in the fifthmonth, [that] Hananiah the son of Azur the prophet, which [was] ofGibeon, spake unto me in the house of the LORD, in the presence of thepriests and of all the people, saying, 

{28:2} Thus speaketh the LORD ofhosts, the God of Israel, saying, I have broken the yoke of the king ofBabylon. 

{28:3} Within two full years will I bring again into thisplace all the vessels of the LORD'S house, that Nebuchadnezzar king ofBabylon took away from this place, and carried them to Babylon: 

{28:4}And I will bring again to this place Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim kingof Judah, with all the captives of Judah, that went into Babylon, saiththe LORD: for I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon.   

{28:5} Then the prophet Jeremiah said unto the prophet Hananiah inthe presence of the priests, and in the presence of all the people thatstood in the house of the LORD, 

{28:6} Even the prophet Jeremiah said,Amen: the LORD do so: the LORD perform thy words which thou hastprophesied, to bring again the vessels of the LORD'S house, and allthat is carried away captive, from Babylon into this place. 

{28:7}Nevertheless hear thou now this word that I speak in thine ears, and inthe ears of all the people; 

{28:8} The prophets that have been beforeme and before thee of old prophesied both against many countries, andagainst great kingdoms, of war, and of evil, and of pestilence. 

{28:9}The prophet which prophesieth of peace, when the word of the prophetshall come to pass, [then] shall the prophet be known, that the LORDhath truly sent him.   

{28:10} Then Hananiah the prophet took the yoke from off the prophetJeremiah's neck, and brake it. 

{28:11} And Hananiah spake in thepresence of all the people, saying, Thus saith the LORD; Even so will Ibreak the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon from the neck of allnations within the space of two full years. And the prophet Jeremiahwent his way.   

{28:12} Then the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah [the prophet,]after that Hananiah the prophet had broken the yoke from off the neckof the prophet Jeremiah, saying, 

{28:13} Go and tell Hananiah, saying,Thus saith the LORD; Thou hast broken the yokes of wood; but thou shaltmake for them yokes of iron. 

{28:14} For thus saith the LORD of hosts,the God of Israel; I have put a yoke of iron upon the neck of all thesenations, that they may serve Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon; and theyshall serve him: and I have given him the beasts of the field also.   

{28:15} Then said the prophet Jeremiah unto Hananiah the prophet,Hear now, Hananiah; The LORD hath not sent thee; but thou makest thispeople to trust in a lie. 

{28:16} Therefore thus saith the LORD;Behold, I will cast thee from off the face of the earth: this year thoushalt die, because thou hast taught rebellion against the LORD. 

{28:17}So Hananiah the prophet died the same year in the seventh month.   

{29:1} Now these [are] the words of the letter that Jeremiah theprophet sent from Jerusalem unto the residue of the elders which werecarried away captives, and to the priests, and to the prophets, and toall the people whom Nebuchadnezzar had carried away captive fromJerusalem to Babylon; 

{29:2} (After that Jeconiah the king, and thequeen, and the eunuchs, the princes of Judah and Jerusalem, and thecarpenters, and the smiths, were departed from Jerusalem;) 

{29:3} Bythe hand of Elasah the son of Shaphan, and Gemariah the son of Hilkiah,(whom Zedekiah king of Judah sent unto Babylon to Nebuchadnezzar kingof Babylon) saying, 

{29:4} Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God ofIsrael, unto all that are carried away captives, whom I have caused tobe carried away from Jerusalem unto Babylon; 

{29:5} Build ye houses,and dwell [in them;] and plant gardens, and eat the fruit of them;

{29:6} Take ye wives, and beget sons and daughters; and take wives foryour sons, and give your daughters to husbands, that they may bear sonsand daughters; that ye may be increased there, and not diminished.

{29:7} And seek the peace of the city whither I have caused you to becarried away captives, and pray unto the LORD for it: for in the peacethereof shall ye have peace.   

{29:8} For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Let notyour prophets and your diviners, that [be] in the midst of you, deceiveyou, neither hearken to your dreams which ye cause to be dreamed.

{29:9} For they prophesy falsely unto you in my name: I have not sentthem, saith the LORD.   

{29:10} For thus saith the LORD, That after seventy years beaccomplished at Babylon I will visit you, and perform my good wordtoward you, in causing you to return to this place. 

{29:11} For I knowthe thoughts that I think toward you, saith the LORD, thoughts ofpeace, and not of evil, to give you an expected end. 

{29:12} Then shallye call upon me, and ye shall go and pray unto me, and I will hearkenunto you. 

{29:13} And ye shall seek me, and find [me,] when ye shallsearch for me with all your heart. 

{29:14} And I will be found of you,saith the LORD: and I will turn away your captivity, and I will gatheryou from all the nations, and from all the places whither I have drivenyou, saith the LORD; and I will bring you again into the place whence Icaused you to be carried away captive.   

{29:15} Because ye have said, The LORD hath raised us up prophets inBabylon; 

{29:16} [Know] that thus saith the LORD of the king thatsitteth upon the throne of David, and of all the people that dwellethin this city, [and] of your brethren that are not gone forth with youinto captivity; 

{29:17} Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Behold, I willsend upon them the sword, the famine, and the pestilence, and will makethem like vile figs, that cannot be eaten, they are so evil. 

{29:18}And I will persecute them with the sword, with the famine, and with thepestilence, and will deliver them to be removed to all the kingdoms ofthe earth, to be a curse, and an astonishment, and an hissing, and areproach, among all the nations whither I have driven them: 

{29:19}Because they have not hearkened to my words, saith the LORD, which Isent unto them by my servants the prophets, rising up early and sending[them;] but ye would not hear, saith the LORD.   

{29:20} Hear ye therefore the word of the LORD, all ye of thecaptivity, whom I have sent from Jerusalem to Babylon: 

{29:21} Thussaith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, of Ahab the son of Kolaiah,and of Zedekiah the son of Maaseiah, which prophesy a lie unto you inmy name; Behold, I will deliver them into the hand of Nebuchadrezzarking of Babylon; and he shall slay them before your eyes; 

{29:22} Andof them shall be taken up a curse by all the captivity of Judah which[are] in Babylon, saying, The LORD make thee like Zedekiah and likeAhab, whom the king of Babylon roasted in the fire; 

{29:23} Becausethey have committed villany in Israel, and have committed adultery withtheir neighbours' wives, and have spoken lying words in my name, whichI have not commanded them; even I know, and [am] a witness, saith theLORD.   

{29:24} [Thus] shalt thou also speak to Shemaiah the Nehelamite,saying, 

{29:25} Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel,saying, Because thou hast sent letters in thy name unto all the peoplethat [are] at Jerusalem, and to Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah thepriest, and to all the priests, saying, 

{29:26} The LORD hath made theepriest in the stead of Jehoiada the priest, that ye should be officersin the house of the LORD, for every man [that is] mad, and makethhimself a prophet, that thou shouldest put him in prison, and in thestocks. 

{29:27} Now therefore why hast thou not reproved Jeremiah ofAnathoth, which maketh himself a prophet to you? 

{29:28} For thereforehe sent unto us [in] Babylon, saying, This [captivity is] long: buildye houses, and dwell [in them;] and plant gardens, and eat the fruit ofthem. 

{29:29} And Zephaniah the priest read this letter in the ears ofJeremiah the prophet.   

{29:30} Then came the word of the LORD unto Jeremiah, saying,

{29:31} Send to all them of the captivity, saying, Thus saith the LORDconcerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite; Because that Shemaiah hathprophesied unto you, and I sent him not, and he caused you to trust ina lie: 

{29:32} Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will punishShemaiah the Nehelamite, and his seed: he shall not have a man to dwellamong this people; neither shall he behold the good that I will do formy people, saith the LORD; because he hath taught rebellion against theLORD.   

{30:1} The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying, 

{30:2}Thus speaketh the LORD God of Israel, saying, Write thee all the wordsthat I have spoken unto thee in a book. 

{30:3} For, lo, the days come,saith the LORD, that I will bring again the captivity of my peopleIsrael and Judah, saith the LORD: and I will cause them to return tothe land that I gave to their fathers, and they shall possess it.   

{30:4} And these [are] the words that the LORD spake concerningIsrael and concerning Judah. 

{30:5} For thus saith the LORD; We haveheard a voice of trembling, of fear, and not of peace. 

{30:6} Ask yenow, and see whether a man doth travail with child? wherefore do I seeevery man with his hands on his loins, as a woman in travail, and allfaces are turned into paleness? 

{30:7} Alas! for that day [is] great,so that none [is] like it: it [is] even the time of Jacob's trouble;but he shall be saved out of it. 

{30:8} For it shall come to pass inthat day, saith the LORD of hosts, [that] I will break his yoke fromoff thy neck, and will burst thy bonds, and strangers shall no moreserve themselves of him: 

{30:9} But they shall serve the LORD theirGod, and David their king, whom I will raise up unto them.   

{30:10} Therefore fear thou not, O my servant Jacob, saith the LORD;neither be dismayed, O Israel: for, lo, I will save thee from afar, andthy seed from the land of their captivity; and Jacob shall return, andshall be in rest, and be quiet, and none shall make [him] afraid.

{30:11} For I [am] with thee, saith the LORD, to save thee: though Imake a full end of all nations whither I have scattered thee, yet willI not make a full end of thee: but I will correct thee in measure, andwill not leave thee altogether unpunished. 

{30:12} For thus saith theLORD, Thy bruise [is] incurable, [and] thy wound [is] grievous. 

{30:13}[There is] none to plead thy cause, that thou mayest be bound up: thouhast no healing medicines. 

{30:14} All thy lovers have forgotten thee;they seek thee not; for I have wounded thee with the wound of an enemy,with the chastisement of a cruel one, for the multitude of thineiniquity; [because] thy sins were increased. 

{30:15} Why criest thoufor thine affliction? thy sorrow [is] incurable for the multitude ofthine iniquity: [because] thy sins were increased, I have done thesethings unto thee. 

{30:16} Therefore all they that devour thee shall bedevoured; and all thine adversaries, every one of them, shall go intocaptivity; and they that spoil thee shall be a spoil, and all that preyupon thee will I give for a prey. 

{30:17} For I will restore healthunto thee, and I will heal thee of thy wounds, saith the LORD; becausethey called thee an Outcast, [saying,] This [is] Zion, whom no manseeketh after.   

{30:18} Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will bring again thecaptivity of Jacob's tents, and have mercy on his dwellingplaces; andthe city shall be builded upon her own heap, and the palace shallremain after the manner thereof. 

{30:19} And out of them shall proceedthanksgiving and the voice of them that make merry: and I will multiplythem, and they shall not be few; I will also glorify them, and theyshall not be small. 

{30:20} Their children also shall be as aforetime,and their congregation shall be established before me, and I willpunish all that oppress them. 

{30:21} And their nobles shall be ofthemselves, and their governor shall proceed from the midst of them;and I will cause him to draw near, and he shall approach unto me: forwho [is] this that engaged his heart to approach unto me? saith theLORD. 

{30:22} And ye shall be my people, and I will be your God.

{30:23} Behold, the whirlwind of the LORD goeth forth with fury, acontinuing whirlwind: it shall fall with pain upon the head of thewicked. 

{30:24} The fierce anger of the LORD shall not return, until hehave done [it,] and until he have performed the intents of his heart:in the latter days ye shall consider it.   

{31:1} At the same time, saith the LORD, will I be the God of allthe families of Israel, and they shall be my people. 

{31:2} Thus saiththe LORD, The people [which were] left of the sword found grace in thewilderness; [even] Israel, when I went to cause him to rest. 

{31:3} TheLORD hath appeared of old unto me, [saying,] Yea, I have loved theewith an everlasting love: therefore with lovingkindness have I drawnthee. 

{31:4} Again I will build thee, and thou shalt be built, O virginof Israel: thou shalt again be adorned with thy tabrets, and shalt goforth in the dances of them that make merry. 

{31:5} Thou shalt yetplant vines upon the mountains of Samaria: the planters shall plant,and shall eat [them] as common things. 

{31:6} For there shall be a day,[that] the watchmen upon the mount Ephraim shall cry, Arise ye, and letus go up to Zion unto the LORD our God. 

{31:7} For thus saith the LORD;Sing with gladness for Jacob, and shout among the chief of the nations:publish ye, praise ye, and say, O LORD, save thy people, the remnant ofIsrael. 

{31:8} Behold, I will bring them from the north country, andgather them from the coasts of the earth, [and] with them the blind andthe lame, the woman with child and her that travaileth with childtogether: a great company shall return thither. 

{31:9} They shall comewith weeping, and with supplications will I lead them: I will causethem to walk by the rivers of waters in a straight way, wherein theyshall not stumble: for I am a father to Israel, and Ephraim [is] myfirstborn.   

{31:10} Hear the word of the LORD, O ye nations, and declare [it] inthe isles afar off, and say, He that scattered Israel will gather him,and keep him, as a shepherd [doth] his flock. 

{31:11} For the LORD hathredeemed Jacob, and ransomed him from the hand of [him that was]stronger than he. 

{31:12} Therefore they shall come and sing in theheight of Zion, and shall flow together to the goodness of the LORD,for wheat, and for wine, and for oil, and for the young of the flockand of the herd: and their soul shall be as a watered garden; and theyshall not sorrow any more at all. 

{31:13} Then shall the virgin rejoicein the dance, both young men and old together: for I will turn theirmourning into joy, and will comfort them, and make them rejoice fromtheir sorrow. 

{31:14} And I will satiate the soul of the priests withfatness, and my people shall be satisfied with my goodness, saith theLORD.   

{31:15} Thus saith the LORD; A voice was heard in Ramah,lamentation, [and] bitter weeping; Rahel weeping for her childrenrefused to be comforted for her children, because they [were] not.

{31:16} Thus saith the LORD; Refrain thy voice from weeping, and thineeyes from tears: for thy work shall be rewarded, saith the LORD; andthey shall come again from the land of the enemy. 

{31:17} And there ishope in thine end, saith the LORD, that thy children shall come againto their own border.   

{31:18} I have surely heard Ephraim bemoaning himself [thus;] Thouhast chastised me, and I was chastised, as a bullock unaccustomed [tothe yoke:] turn thou me, and I shall be turned; for thou [art] the LORDmy God. 

{31:19} Surely after that I was turned, I repented; and afterthat I was instructed, I smote upon [my] thigh: I was ashamed, yea,even confounded, because I did bear the reproach of my youth. 

{31:20}[Is] Ephraim my dear son? [is he] a pleasant child? for since I spakeagainst him, I do earnestly remember him still: therefore my bowels aretroubled for him; I will surely have mercy upon him, saith the LORD.

{31:21} Set thee up waymarks, make thee high heaps: set thine hearttoward the highway, [even] the way [which] thou wentest: turn again, Ovirgin of Israel, turn again to these thy cities.   

{31:22} How long wilt thou go about, O thou backsliding daughter?for the LORD hath created a new thing in the earth, A woman shallcompass a man. 

{31:23} Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel;As yet they shall use this speech in the land of Judah and in thecities thereof, when I shall bring again their captivity; The LORDbless thee, O habitation of justice, [and] mountain of holiness.

{31:24} And there shall dwell in Judah itself, and in all the citiesthereof together, husbandmen, and they [that] go forth with flocks.

{31:25} For I have satiated the weary soul, and I have replenishedevery sorrowful soul. 

{31:26} Upon this I awaked, and beheld; and mysleep was sweet unto me.   

{31:27} Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will sow thehouse of Israel and the house of Judah with the seed of man, and withthe seed of beast. 

{31:28} And it shall come to pass, [that] like as Ihave watched over them, to pluck up, and to break down, and to throwdown, and to destroy, and to afflict; so will I watch over them, tobuild, and to plant, saith the LORD. 

{31:29} In those days they shallsay no more, The fathers have eaten a sour grape, and the children'steeth are set on edge. 

{31:30} But every one shall die for his owniniquity: every man that eateth the sour grape, his teeth shall be seton edge.   

{31:31} Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will make anew covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah:

{31:32} Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers inthe day [that] I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land ofEgypt; which my covenant they brake, although I was an husband untothem, saith the LORD: 

{31:33} But this [shall be] the covenant that Iwill make with the house of Israel; After those days, saith the LORD, Iwill put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts;and will be their God, and they shall be my people. 

{31:34} And theyshall teach no more every man his neighbour, and every man his brother,saying, Know the LORD: for they shall all know me, from the least ofthem unto the greatest of them, saith the LORD; for I will forgivetheir iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more.   

{31:35} Thus saith the LORD, which giveth the sun for a light byday, [and] the ordinances of the moon and of the stars for a light bynight, which divideth the sea when the waves thereof roar; The LORD ofhosts [is] his name: 

{31:36} If those ordinances depart from before me,saith the LORD, [then] the seed of Israel also shall cease from being anation before me for ever. 

{31:37} Thus saith the LORD; If heaven abovecan be measured, and the foundations of the earth searched out beneath,I will also cast off all the seed of Israel for all that they havedone, saith the LORD.   

{31:38} Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that the city shallbe built to the LORD from the tower of Hananeel unto the gate of thecorner. 

{31:39} And the measuring line shall yet go forth over againstit upon the hill Gareb, and shall compass about to Goath. 

{31:40} Andthe whole valley of the dead bodies, and of the ashes, and all thefields unto the brook of Kidron, unto the corner of the horse gatetoward the east, [shall be] holy unto the LORD; it shall not be pluckedup, nor thrown down any more for ever.   

{32:1} The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD in the tenthyear of Zedekiah king of Judah, which [was] the eighteenth year ofNebuchadrezzar. 

{32:2} For then the king of Babylon's army besiegedJerusalem: and Jeremiah the prophet was shut up in the court of theprison, which [was] in the king of Judah's house. 

{32:3} For Zedekiahking of Judah had shut him up, saying, Wherefore dost thou prophesy,and say, Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will give this city into thehand of the king of Babylon, and he shall take it; 

{32:4} And Zedekiahking of Judah shall not escape out of the hand of the Chaldeans, butshall surely be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon, andshall speak with him mouth to mouth, and his eyes shall behold hiseyes; 

{32:5} And he shall lead Zedekiah to Babylon, and there shall hebe until I visit him, saith the LORD: though ye fight with theChaldeans, ye shall not prosper?   

{32:6} And Jeremiah said, The word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

{32:7} Behold, Hanameel the son of Shallum thine uncle shall come untothee, saying, Buy thee my field that [is] in Anathoth: for the right ofredemption [is] thine to buy [it. ]

{32:8} So Hanameel mine uncle's soncame to me in the court of the prison according to the word of theLORD, and said unto me, Buy my field, I pray thee, that [is] inAnathoth, which [is] in the country of Benjamin: for the right ofinheritance [is] thine, and the redemption [is] thine; buy [it] forthyself. Then I knew that this [was] the word of the LORD. 

{32:9} And Ibought the field of Hanameel my uncle's son, that [was] in Anathoth,and weighed him the money, [even] seventeen shekels of silver. 

{32:10}And I subscribed the evidence, and sealed [it,] and took witnesses, andweighed [him] the money in the balances. 

{32:11} So I took the evidenceof the purchase, [both] that which was sealed [according] to the lawand custom, and that which was open: 

{32:12} And I gave the evidence ofthe purchase unto Baruch the son of Neriah, the son of Maaseiah, in thesight of Hanameel mine uncle's [son,] and in the presence of thewitnesses that subscribed the book of the purchase, before all the Jewsthat sat in the court of the prison.   

{32:13} And I charged Baruch before them, saying, 

{32:14} Thus saiththe LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Take these evidences, thisevidence of the purchase, both which is sealed, and this evidence whichis open; and put them in an earthen vessel, that they may continue manydays. 

{32:15} For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel;Houses and fields and vineyards shall be possessed again in this land.   

{32:16} Now when I had delivered the evidence of the purchase untoBaruch the son of Neriah, I prayed unto the LORD, saying, 

{32:17} AhLord GOD! behold, thou hast made the heaven and the earth by thy greatpower and stretched out arm, [and] there is nothing too hard for thee:

{32:18} Thou shewest lovingkindness unto thousands, and recompensestthe iniquity of the fathers into the bosom of their children afterthem: the Great, the Mighty God, the LORD of hosts, [is] his name,

{32:19} Great in counsel, and mighty in work: for thine eyes [are] openupon all the ways of the sons of men: to give every one according tohis ways, and according to the fruit of his doings: 

{32:20} Which hastset signs and wonders in the land of Egypt, [even] unto this day, andin Israel, and among [other] men; and hast made thee a name, as at thisday; 

{32:21} And hast brought forth thy people Israel out of the landof Egypt with signs, and with wonders, and with a strong hand, and witha stretched out arm, and with great terror; 

{32:22} And hast given themthis land, which thou didst swear to their fathers to give them, a landflowing with milk and honey; 

{32:23} And they came in, and possessedit; but they obeyed not thy voice, neither walked in thy law; they havedone nothing of all that thou commandedst them to do: therefore thouhast caused all this evil to come upon them: 

{32:24} Behold the mounts,they are come unto the city to take it; and the city is given into thehand of the Chaldeans, that fight against it, because of the sword, andof the famine, and of the pestilence: and what thou hast spoken is cometo pass; and, behold, thou seest [it. ]

{32:25} And thou hast said untome, O Lord GOD, Buy thee the field for money, and take witnesses; forthe city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans.   

{32:26} Then came the word of the LORD unto Jeremiah, saying,

{32:27} Behold, I [am] the LORD, the God of all flesh: is there anything too hard for me? 

{32:28} Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, Iwill give this city into the hand of the Chaldeans, and into the handof Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and he shall take it: 

{32:29} Andthe Chaldeans, that fight against this city, shall come and set fire onthis city, and burn it with the houses, upon whose roofs they haveoffered incense unto Baal, and poured out drink offerings unto othergods, to provoke me to anger. 

{32:30} For the children of Israel andthe children of Judah have only done evil before me from their youth:for the children of Israel have only provoked me to anger with the workof their hands, saith the LORD. 

{32:31} For this city hath been to me[as] a provocation of mine anger and of my fury from the day that theybuilt it even unto this day; that I should remove it from before myface, 

{32:32} Because of all the evil of the children of Israel and ofthe children of Judah, which they have done to provoke me to anger,they, their kings, their princes, their priests, and their prophets,and the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem. 

{32:33} Andthey have turned unto me the back, and not the face: though I taughtthem, rising up early and teaching [them,] yet they have not hearkenedto receive instruction. 

{32:34} But they set their abominations in thehouse, which is called by my name, to defile it. 

{32:35} And they builtthe high places of Baal, which [are] in the valley of the son ofHinnom, to cause their sons and their daughters to pass through [thefire] unto Molech; which I commanded them not, neither came it into mymind, that they should do this abomination, to cause Judah to sin.   

{32:36} And now therefore thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel,concerning this city, whereof ye say, It shall be delivered into thehand of the king of Babylon by the sword, and by the famine, and by thepestilence; 

{32:37} Behold, I will gather them out of all countries,whither I have driven them in mine anger, and in my fury, and in greatwrath; and I will bring them again unto this place, and I will causethem to dwell safely: 

{32:38} And they shall be my people, and I willbe their God: 

{32:39} And I will give them one heart, and one way, thatthey may fear me for ever, for the good of them, and of their childrenafter them: 

{32:40} And I will make an everlasting covenant with them,that I will not turn away from them, to do them good; but I will put myfear in their hearts, that they shall not depart from me. 

{32:41} Yea,I will rejoice over them to do them good, and I will plant them in thisland assuredly with my whole heart and with my whole soul. 

{32:42} Forthus saith the LORD; Like as I have brought all this great evil uponthis people, so will I bring upon them all the good that I havepromised them. 

{32:43} And fields shall be bought in this land, whereofye say, [It is] desolate without man or beast; it is given into thehand of the Chaldeans. 

{32:44} Men shall buy fields for money, andsubscribe evidences, and seal [them,] and take witnesses in the land ofBenjamin, and in the places about Jerusalem, and in the cities ofJudah, and in the cities of the mountains, and in the cities of thevalley, and in the cities of the south: for I will cause theircaptivity to return, saith the LORD.   

{33:1} Moreover the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah the secondtime, while he was yet shut up in the court of the prison, saying,

{33:2} Thus saith the LORD the maker thereof, the LORD that formed it,to establish it; the LORD [is] his name; 

{33:3} Call unto me, and Iwill answer thee, and shew thee great and mighty things, which thouknowest not. 

{33:4} For thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel,concerning the houses of this city, and concerning the houses of thekings of Judah, which are thrown down by the mounts, and by the sword;

{33:5} They come to fight with the Chaldeans, but [it is] fill themwith the dead bodies of men, whom I have slain in mine anger and in myfury, and for all whose wickedness I have hid my face from this city.

{33:6} Behold, I will bring it health and cure, and I will cure them,and will reveal unto them the abundance of peace and truth. 

{33:7} AndI will cause the captivity of Judah and the captivity of Israel toreturn, and will build them, as at the first. 

{33:8} And I will cleansethem from all their iniquity, whereby they have sinned against me; andI will pardon all their iniquities, whereby they have sinned, andwhereby they have transgressed against me.   

{33:9} And it shall be to me a name of joy, a praise and an honourbefore all the nations of the earth, which shall hear all the good thatI do unto them: and they shall fear and tremble for all the goodnessand for all the prosperity that I procure unto it. 

{33:10} Thus saiththe LORD; Again there shall be heard in this place, which ye say [shallbe] desolate without man and without beast, [even] in the cities ofJudah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, that are desolate, without man,and without inhabitant, and without beast, 

{33:11} The voice of joy,and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voiceof the bride, the voice of them that shall say, Praise the LORD ofhosts: for the LORD [is] good; for his mercy [endureth] for ever: [and]of them that shall bring the sacrifice of praise into the house of theLORD. For I will cause to return the captivity of the land, as at thefirst, saith the LORD. 

{33:12} Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Again inthis place, which is desolate without man and without beast, and in allthe cities thereof, shall be an habitation of shepherds causing [their]flocks to lie down. 

{33:13} In the cities of the mountains, in thecities of the vale, and in the cities of the south, and in the land ofBenjamin, and in the places about Jerusalem, and in the cities ofJudah, shall the flocks pass again under the hands of him that telleth[them,] saith the LORD. 

{33:14} Behold, the days come, saith the LORD,that I will perform that good thing which I have promised unto thehouse of Israel and to the house of Judah.   

{33:15} In those days, and at that time, will I cause the Branch ofrighteousness to grow up unto David; and he shall execute judgment andrighteousness in the land. 

{33:16} In those days shall Judah be saved,and Jerusalem shall dwell safely: and this [is the name] wherewith sheshall be called, The LORD our righteousness.   

{33:17} For thus saith the LORD; David shall never want a man to situpon the throne of the house of Israel; 

{33:18} Neither shall thepriests the Levites want a man before me to offer burnt offerings, andto kindle meat offerings, and to do sacrifice continually.   

{33:19} And the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah, saying, 

{33:20}Thus saith the LORD; If ye can break my covenant of the day, and mycovenant of the night, and that there should not be day and night intheir season; 

{33:21} [Then] may also my covenant be broken with Davidmy servant, that he should not have a son to reign upon his throne; andwith the Levites the priests, my ministers. 

{33:22} As the host ofheaven cannot be numbered, neither the sand of the sea measured: sowill I multiply the seed of David my servant, and the Levites thatminister unto me. 

{33:23} Moreover the word of the LORD came toJeremiah, saying, 

{33:24} Considerest thou not what this people havespoken, saying, The two families which the LORD hath chosen, he hatheven cast them off? thus they have despised my people, that they shouldbe no more a nation before them. 

{33:25} Thus saith the LORD; If mycovenant be not with day and night, [and if] I have not appointed theordinances of heaven and earth; 

{33:26} Then will I cast away the seedof Jacob, and David my servant, so that I will not take [any] of hisseed [to be] rulers over the seed of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob: for Iwill cause their captivity to return, and have mercy on them.   

{34:1} The word which came unto Jeremiah from the LORD, whenNebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and all his army, and all the kingdomsof the earth of his dominion, and all the people, fought againstJerusalem, and against all the cities thereof, saying, 

{34:2} Thussaith the LORD, the God of Israel; Go and speak to Zedekiah king ofJudah, and tell him, Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will give this cityinto the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall burn it with fire:

{34:3} And thou shalt not escape out of his hand, but shalt surely betaken, and delivered into his hand; and thine eyes shall behold theeyes of the king of Babylon, and he shall speak with thee mouth tomouth, and thou shalt go to Babylon. 

{34:4} Yet hear the word of theLORD, O Zedekiah king of Judah; Thus saith the LORD of thee, Thou shaltnot die by the sword: 

{34:5} [But] thou shalt die in peace: and withthe burnings of thy fathers, the former kings which were before thee,so shall they burn [odours] for thee; and they will lament thee,[saying,] Ah lord! for I have pronounced the word, saith the LORD.

{34:6} Then Jeremiah the prophet spake all these words unto Zedekiahking of Judah in Jerusalem, 

{34:7} When the king of Babylon's armyfought against Jerusalem, and against all the cities of Judah that wereleft, against Lachish, and against Azekah: for these defenced citiesremained of the cities of Judah.   

{34:8} [This is] the word that came unto Jeremiah from the LORD,after that the king Zedekiah had made a covenant with all the peoplewhich [were] at Jerusalem, to proclaim liberty unto them; 

{34:9} Thatevery man should let his manservant, and every man his maidservant,[being] an Hebrew or an Hebrewess, go free; that none should servehimself of them, [to wit,] of a Jew his brother. 

{34:10} Now when allthe princes, and all the people, which had entered into the covenant,heard that every one should let his manservant, and every one hismaidservant, go free, that none should serve themselves of them anymore, then they obeyed, and let [them] go. 

{34:11} But afterward theyturned, and caused the servants and the handmaids, whom they had let gofree, to return, and brought them into subjection for servants and forhandmaids.   

{34:12} Therefore the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah from theLORD, saying, 

{34:13} Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel; I made acovenant with your fathers in the day that I brought them forth out ofthe land of Egypt, out of the house of bondmen, saying, 

{34:14} At theend of seven years let ye go every man his brother an Hebrew, whichhath been sold unto thee; and when he hath served thee six years, thoushalt let him go free from thee: but your fathers hearkened not untome, neither inclined their ear. 

{34:15} And ye were now turned, and haddone right in my sight, in proclaiming liberty every man to hisneighbour; and ye had made a covenant before me in the house which iscalled by my name: 

{34:16} But ye turned and polluted my name, andcaused every man his servant, and every man his handmaid, whom ye hadset at liberty at their pleasure, to return, and brought them intosubjection, to be unto you for servants and for handmaids. 

{34:17}Therefore thus saith the LORD; Ye have not hearkened unto me, inproclaiming liberty, every one to his brother, and every man to hisneighbour: behold, I proclaim a liberty for you, saith the LORD, to thesword, to the pestilence, and to the famine; and I will make you to beremoved into all the kingdoms of the earth. 

{34:18} And I will give themen that have transgressed my covenant, which have not performed thewords of the covenant which they had made before me, when they cut thecalf in twain, and passed between the parts thereof, 

{34:19} Theprinces of Judah, and the princes of Jerusalem, the eunuchs, and thepriests, and all the people of the land, which passed between the partsof the calf; 

{34:20} I will even give them into the hand of theirenemies, and into the hand of them that seek their life: and their deadbodies shall be for meat unto the fowls of the heaven, and to thebeasts of the earth. 

{34:21} And Zedekiah king of Judah and his princeswill I give into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of themthat seek their life, and into the hand of the king of Babylon's army,which are gone up from you. 

{34:22} Behold, I will command, saith theLORD, and cause them to return to this city; and they shall fightagainst it, and take it, and burn it with fire: and I will make thecities of Judah a desolation without an inhabitant.   

{35:1} The word which came unto Jeremiah from the LORD in the daysof Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, saying, 

{35:2} Go untothe house of the Rechabites, and speak unto them, and bring them intothe house of the LORD, into one of the chambers, and give them wine todrink. 

{35:3} Then I took Jaazaniah the son of Jeremiah, the son ofHabaziniah, and his brethren, and all his sons, and the whole house ofthe Rechabites; 

{35:4} And I brought them into the house of the LORD,into the chamber of the sons of Hanan, the son of Igdaliah, a man ofGod, which [was] by the chamber of the princes, which [was] above thechamber of Maaseiah the son of Shallum, the keeper of the door: 

{35:5}And I set before the sons of the house of the Rechabites pots full ofwine, and cups, and I said unto them, Drink ye wine. 

{35:6} But theysaid, We will drink no wine: for Jonadab the son of Rechab our fathercommanded us, saying, Ye shall drink no wine, [neither] ye, nor yoursons for ever: 

{35:7} Neither shall ye build house, nor sow seed, norplant vineyard, nor have [any:] but all your days ye shall dwell intents; that ye may live many days in the land where ye [be] strangers.

{35:8} Thus have we obeyed the voice of Jonadab the son of Rechab ourfather in all that he hath charged us, to drink no wine all our days,we, our wives, our sons, nor our daughters; 

{35:9} Nor to build housesfor us to dwell in: neither have we vineyard, nor field, nor seed:

{35:10} But we have dwelt in tents, and have obeyed, and done accordingto all that Jonadab our father commanded us. 

{35:11} But it came topass, when Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon came up into the land, thatwe said, Come, and let us go to Jerusalem for fear of the army of theChaldeans, and for fear of the army of the Syrians: so we dwell atJerusalem.   

{35:12} Then came the word of the LORD unto Jeremiah, saying,

{35:13} Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Go and tellthe men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, Will ye not receiveinstruction to hearken to my words? saith the LORD. 

{35:14} The wordsof Jonadab the son of Rechab, that he commanded his sons not to drinkwine, are performed; for unto this day they drink none, but obey theirfather's commandment: notwithstanding I have spoken unto you, risingearly and speaking; but ye hearkened not unto me. 

{35:15} I have sentalso unto you all my servants the prophets, rising up early and sending[them,] saying, Return ye now every man from his evil way, and amendyour doings, and go not after other gods to serve them, and ye shalldwell in the land which I have given to you and to your fathers: but yehave not inclined your ear, nor hearkened unto me. 

{35:16} Because thesons of Jonadab the son of Rechab have performed the commandment oftheir father, which he commanded them; but this people hath nothearkened unto me: 

{35:17} Therefore thus saith the LORD God of hosts,the God of Israel; Behold, I will bring upon Judah and upon all theinhabitants of Jerusalem all the evil that I have pronounced againstthem: because I have spoken unto them, but they have not heard; and Ihave called unto them, but they have not answered.   

{35:18} And Jeremiah said unto the house of the Rechabites, Thussaith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Because ye have obeyed thecommandment of Jonadab your father, and kept all his precepts, and doneaccording unto all that he hath commanded you: 

{35:19} Therefore thussaith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Jonadab the son of Rechabshall not want a man to stand before me for ever.   

{36:1} And it came to pass in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the sonof Josiah king of Judah, [that] this word came unto Jeremiah from theLORD, saying, 

{36:2} Take thee a roll of a book, and write therein allthe words that I have spoken unto thee against Israel, and againstJudah, and against all the nations, from the day I spake unto thee,from the days of Josiah, even into this day. 

{36:3} It may be that thehouse of Judah will hear all the evil which I purpose to do unto them;that they may return every man from his evil way; that I may forgivetheir iniquity and their sin. 

{36:4} Then Jeremiah called Baruch theson of Neriah: and Baruch wrote from the mouth of Jeremiah all thewords of the LORD, which he had spoken unto him, upon a roll of a book.

{36:5} And Jeremiah commanded Baruch, saying, I [am] shut up; I cannotgo into the house of the LORD: 

{36:6} Therefore go thou, and read inthe roll, which thou hast written from my mouth, the words of the LORDin the ears of the people in the LORD'S house upon the fasting day: andalso thou shalt read them in the ears of all Judah that come out oftheir cities. 

{36:7} It may be they will present their supplicationbefore the LORD, and will return every one from his evil way: for great[is] the anger and the fury that the LORD hath pronounced against thispeople. 

{36:8} And Baruch the son of Neriah did according to all thatJeremiah the prophet commanded him, reading in the book the words ofthe LORD in the LORD'S house. 

{36:9} And it came to pass in the fifthyear of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, in the ninth month,[that] they proclaimed a fast before the LORD to all the people inJerusalem, and to all the people that came from the cities of Judahunto Jerusalem. 

{36:10} Then read Baruch in the book the words ofJeremiah in the house of the LORD, in the chamber of Gemariah the sonof Shaphan the scribe, in the higher court, at the entry of the newgate of the LORD'S house, in the ears of all the people.   

{36:11} When Michaiah the son of Gemariah, the son of Shaphan, hadheard out of the book all the words of the LORD, 

{36:12} Then he wentdown into the king's house, into the scribe's chamber: and, lo, all theprinces sat there, [even] Elishama the scribe, and Delaiah the son ofShemaiah, and Elnathan the son of Achbor, and Gemariah the son ofShaphan, and Zedekiah the son of Hananiah, and all the princes. 

{36:13}Then Michaiah declared unto them all the words that he had heard, whenBaruch read the book in the ears of the people. 

{36:14} Therefore allthe princes sent Jehudi the son of Nethaniah, the son of Shelemiah, theson of Cushi, unto Baruch, saying, Take in thine hand the roll whereinthou hast read in the ears of the people, and come. So Baruch the sonof Neriah took the roll in his hand, and came unto them. 

{36:15} Andthey said unto him, Sit down now, and read it in our ears. So Baruchread [it] in their ears. 

{36:16} Now it came to pass, when they hadheard all the words, they were afraid both one and other, and said untoBaruch, We will surely tell the king of all these words. 

{36:17} Andthey asked Baruch, saying, Tell us now, How didst thou write all thesewords at his mouth? 

{36:18} Then Baruch answered them, He pronouncedall these words unto me with his mouth, and I wrote [them] with ink inthe book. 

{36:19} Then said the princes unto Baruch, Go, hide thee,thou and Jeremiah; and let no man know where ye be.   

{36:20} And they went in to the king into the court, but they laidup the roll in the chamber of Elishama the scribe, and told all thewords in the ears of the king. 

{36:21} So the king sent Jehudi to fetchthe roll: and he took it out of Elishama the scribe's chamber. AndJehudi read it in the ears of the king, and in the ears of all theprinces which stood beside the king. 

{36:22} Now the king sat in thewinterhouse in the ninth month: and [there was a fire] on the hearthburning before him. 

{36:23} And it came to pass, [that] when Jehudi hadread three or four leaves, he cut it with the penknife, and cast [it]into the fire that [was] on the hearth, until all the roll was consumedin the fire that [was] on the hearth. 

{36:24} Yet they were not afraid,nor rent their garments, [neither] the king, nor any of his servantsthat heard all these words. 

{36:25} Nevertheless Elnathan and Delaiahand Gemariah had made intercession to the king that he would not burnthe roll: but he would not hear them. 

{36:26} But the king commandedJerahmeel the son of Hammelech, and Seraiah the son of Azriel, andShelemiah the son of Abdeel, to take Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah theprophet: but the LORD hid them.   

{36:27} Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, after that theking had burned the roll, and the words which Baruch wrote at the mouthof Jeremiah, saying, 

{36:28} Take thee again another roll, and write init all the former words that were in the first roll, which Jehoiakimthe king of Judah hath burned. 

{36:29} And thou shalt say to Jehoiakimthe king of Judah, Thus saith the LORD; Thou hast burned this roll,saying, Why hast thou written therein, saying, The king of Babylonshall certainly come and destroy this land, and shall cause to ceasefrom thence man and beast? 

{36:30} Therefore thus saith the LORD ofJehoiakim king of Judah; He shall have none to sit upon the throne ofDavid: and his dead body shall be cast out in the day to the heat, andin the night to the frost. 

{36:31} And I will punish him and his seedand his servants for their iniquity; and I will bring upon them, andupon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and upon the men of Judah, all theevil that I have pronounced against them; but they hearkened not.   

{36:32} Then took Jeremiah another roll, and gave it to Baruch thescribe, the son of Neriah; who wrote therein from the mouth of Jeremiahall the words of the book which Jehoiakim king of Judah had burned inthe fire: and there were added besides unto them many like words.   

{37:1} And king Zedekiah the son of Josiah reigned instead of Coniahthe son of Jehoiakim, whom Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon made king inthe land of Judah. 

{37:2} But neither he, nor his servants, nor thepeople of the land, did hearken unto the words of the LORD, which hespake by the prophet Jeremiah. 

{37:3} And Zedekiah the king sentJehucal the son of Shelemiah and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah thepriest to the prophet Jeremiah, saying, Pray now unto the LORD our Godfor us. 

{37:4} Now Jeremiah came in and went out among the people: forthey had not put him into prison. 

{37:5} Then Pharaoh's army was comeforth out of Egypt: and when the Chaldeans that besieged Jerusalemheard tidings of them, they departed from Jerusalem.   

{37:6} Then came the word of the LORD unto the prophet Jeremiah,saying, 

{37:7} Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel; Thus shall yesay to the king of Judah, that sent you unto me to enquire of me;Behold, Pharaoh's army, which is come forth to help you, shall returnto Egypt into their own land. 

{37:8} And the Chaldeans shall comeagain, and fight against this city, and take it, and burn it with fire.

{37:9} Thus saith the LORD; Deceive not yourselves, saying, TheChaldeans shall surely depart from us: for they shall not depart.

{37:10} For though ye had smitten the whole army of the Chaldeans thatfight against you, and there remained [but] wounded men among them,[yet] should they rise up every man in his tent, and burn this citywith fire.   

{37:11} And it came to pass, that when the army of the Chaldeans wasbroken up from Jerusalem for fear of Pharaoh's army, 

{37:12} ThenJeremiah went forth out of Jerusalem to go into the land of Benjamin,to separate himself thence in the midst of the people. 

{37:13} And whenhe was in the gate of Benjamin, a captain of the ward [was] there,whose name [was] Irijah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Hananiah; andhe took Jeremiah the prophet, saying, Thou fallest away to theChaldeans. 

{37:14} Then said Jeremiah, [It is] false; I fall not awayto the Chaldeans. But he hearkened not to him: so Irijah took Jeremiah,and brought him to the princes. 

{37:15} Wherefore the princes werewroth with Jeremiah, and smote him, and put him in prison in the houseof Jonathan the scribe: for they had made that the prison.   

{37:16} When Jeremiah was entered into the dungeon, and into thecabins, and Jeremiah had remained there many days; 

{37:17} ThenZedekiah the king sent, and took him out: and the king asked himsecretly in his house, and said, Is there [any] word from the LORD? AndJeremiah said, There is: for, said he, thou shalt be delivered into thehand of the king of Babylon. 

{37:18} Moreover Jeremiah said unto kingZedekiah, What have I offended against thee, or against thy servants,or against this people, that ye have put me in prison? 

{37:19} Where[are] now your prophets which prophesied unto you, saying, The king ofBabylon shall not come against you, nor against this land? 

{37:20}Therefore hear now, I pray thee, O my lord the king: let mysupplication, I pray thee, be accepted before thee; that thou cause menot to return to the house of Jonathan the scribe, lest I die there.

{37:21} Then Zedekiah the king commanded that they should commitJeremiah into the court of the prison, and that they should give himdaily a piece of bread out of the bakers street, until all the bread inthe city were spent. Thus Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison.   

{38:1} Then Shephatiah the son of Mattan, and Gedaliah the son ofPashur, and Jucal the son of Shelemiah, and Pashur the son of Malchiah,heard the words that Jeremiah had spoken unto all the people, saying,

{38:2} Thus saith the LORD, He that remaineth in this city shall die bythe sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence: but he that goethforth to the Chaldeans shall live; for he shall have his life for aprey, and shall live. 

{38:3} Thus saith the LORD, This city shallsurely be given into the hand of the king of Babylon's army, whichshall take it. 

{38:4} Therefore the princes said unto the king, Webeseech thee, let this man be put to death: for thus he weakeneth thehands of the men of war that remain in this city, and the hands of allthe people, in speaking such words unto them: for this man seeketh notthe welfare of this people, but the hurt. 

{38:5} Then Zedekiah the kingsaid, Behold, he is in your hand: for the king [is] not [he that] cando [any] thing against you. 

{38:6} Then took they Jeremiah, and casthim into the dungeon of Malchiah the son of Hammelech, that [was] inthe court of the prison: and they let down Jeremiah with cords. And inthe dungeon [there was] no water, but mire: so Jeremiah sunk in themire.   

{38:7} Now when Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, one of the eunuchs whichwas in the king's house, heard that they had put Jeremiah in thedungeon; the king then sitting in the gate of Benjamin; 

{38:8}Ebed-melech went forth out of the king's house, and spake to the king,saying, 

{38:9} My lord the king, these men have done evil in all thatthey have done to Jeremiah the prophet, whom they have cast into thedungeon; and he is like to die for hunger in the place where he is: for[there is] no more bread in the city. 

{38:10} Then the king commandedEbed-melech the Ethiopian, saying, Take from hence thirty men withthee, and take up Jeremiah the prophet out of the dungeon, before hedie. 

{38:11} So Ebed- melech took the men with him, and went into thehouse of the king under the treasury, and took thence old cast cloutsand old rotten rags, and let them down by cords into the dungeon toJeremiah. 

{38:12} And Ebed-melech the Ethiopian said unto Jeremiah, Putnow [these] old cast clouts and rotten rags under thine armholes underthe cords. And Jeremiah did so. 

{38:13} So they drew up Jeremiah withcords, and took him up out of the dungeon: and Jeremiah remained in thecourt of the prison.   

{38:14} Then Zedekiah the king sent, and took Jeremiah the prophetunto him into the third entry that [is] in the house of the LORD: andthe king said unto Jeremiah, I will ask thee a thing; hide nothing fromme. 

{38:15} Then Jeremiah said unto Zedekiah, If I declare [it] untothee, wilt thou not surely put me to death? and if I give thee counsel,wilt thou not hearken unto me? 

{38:16} So Zedekiah the king swaresecretly unto Jeremiah, saying, [As] the LORD liveth, that made us thissoul, I will not put thee to death, neither will I give thee into thehand of these men that seek thy life. 

{38:17} Then said Jeremiah untoZedekiah, Thus saith the LORD, the God of hosts, the God of Israel; Ifthou wilt assuredly go forth unto the king of Babylon's princes, thenthy soul shall live, and this city shall not be burned with fire; andthou shalt live, and thine house: 

{38:18} But if thou wilt not go forthto the king of Babylon's princes, then shall this city be given intothe hand of the Chaldeans, and they shall burn it with fire, and thoushalt not escape out of their hand. 

{38:19} And Zedekiah the king saidunto Jeremiah, I am afraid of the Jews that are fallen to theChaldeans, lest they deliver me into their hand, and they mock me.

{38:20} But Jeremiah said, They shall not deliver [thee.] Obey, Ibeseech thee, the voice of the LORD, which I speak unto thee: so itshall be well unto thee, and thy soul shall live. 

{38:21} But if thourefuse to go forth, this [is] the word that the LORD hath shewed me:

{38:22} And, behold, all the women that are left in the king of Judah'shouse [shall be] brought forth to the king of Babylon's princes, andthose [women] shall say, Thy friends have set thee on, and haveprevailed against thee: thy feet are sunk in the mire, [and] they areturned away back. 

{38:23} So they shall bring out all thy wives and thychildren to the Chaldeans: and thou shalt not escape out of their hand,but shalt be taken by the hand of the king of Babylon: and thou shaltcause this city to be burned with fire.   

{38:24} Then said Zedekiah unto Jeremiah, Let no man know of thesewords, and thou shalt not die. 

{38:25} But if the princes hear that Ihave talked with thee, and they come unto thee, and say unto thee,Declare unto us now what thou hast said unto the king, hide it not fromus, and we will not put thee to death; also what the king said untothee: 

{38:26} Then thou shalt say unto them, I presented mysupplication before the king, that he would not cause me to return toJonathan's house, to die there. 

{38:27} Then came all the princes untoJeremiah, and asked him: and he told them according to all these wordsthat the king had commanded. So they left off speaking with him; forthe matter was not perceived. 

{38:28} So Jeremiah abode in the court ofthe prison until the day that Jerusalem was taken: and he was [there]when Jerusalem was taken.   

{39:1} In the ninth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the tenthmonth, came Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon and all his army againstJerusalem, and they besieged it. 

{39:2} [And] in the eleventh year ofZedekiah, in the fourth month, the ninth [day] of the month, the citywas broken up. 

{39:3} And all the princes of the king of Babylon camein, and sat in the middle gate, [even] Nergal-sharezer, Samgar-nebo,Sarsechim, Rab- saris, Nergal-sharezer, Rabmag, with all the residue ofthe princes of the king of Babylon.   

{39:4} And it came to pass, [that] when Zedekiah the king of Judahsaw them, and all the men of war, then they fled, and went forth out ofthe city by night, by the way of the king's garden, by the gate betwixtthe two walls: and he went out the way of the plain. 

{39:5} But theChaldeans' army pursued after them, and overtook Zedekiah in the plainsof Jericho: and when they had taken him, they brought him up toNebuchadnezzar king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath, wherehe gave judgment upon him. 

{39:6} Then the king of Babylon slew thesons of Zedekiah in Riblah before his eyes: also the king of Babylonslew all the nobles of Judah. 

{39:7} Moreover he put out Zedekiah'seyes, and bound him with chains, to carry him to Babylon.   

{39:8} And the Chaldeans burned the king's house, and the houses ofthe people, with fire, and brake down the walls of Jerusalem. 

{39:9}Then Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard carried away captive intoBabylon the remnant of the people that remained in the city, and thosethat fell away, that fell to him, with the rest of the people thatremained. 

{39:10} But Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard left of thepoor of the people, which had nothing, in the land of Judah, and gavethem vineyards and fields at the same time.   

{39:11} Now Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon gave charge concerningJeremiah to Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard, saying, 

{39:12} Takehim, and look well to him, and do him no harm; but do unto him even ashe shall say unto thee. 

{39:13} So Nebuzar-adan the captain of theguard sent, and Nebushasban, Rab-saris, and Nergal-sharezer, Rabmag,and all the king of Babylon's princes; 

{39:14} Even they sent, and tookJeremiah out of the court of the prison, and committed him untoGedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan, that he should carry himhome: so he dwelt among the people.   

{39:15} Now the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah, while he wasshut up in the court of the prison, saying, 

{39:16} Go and speak toEbed-melech the Ethiopian, saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, theGod of Israel; Behold, I will bring my words upon this city for evil,and not for good; and they shall be [accomplished] in that day beforethee. 

{39:17} But I will deliver thee in that day, saith the LORD: andthou shalt not be given into the hand of the men of whom thou [art]afraid. 

{39:18} For I will surely deliver thee, and thou shalt not fallby the sword, but thy life shall be for a prey unto thee: because thouhast put thy trust in me, saith the LORD.   

{40:1} The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, after thatNebuzar-adan the captain of the guard had let him go from Ramah, whenhe had taken him being bound in chains among all that were carried awaycaptive of Jerusalem and Judah, which were carried away captive untoBabylon. 

{40:2} And the captain of the guard took Jeremiah, and saidunto him, The LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place.

{40:3} Now the LORD hath brought [it,] and done according as he hathsaid: because ye have sinned against the LORD, and have not obeyed hisvoice, therefore this thing is come upon you. 

{40:4} And now, behold, Iloose thee this day from the chains which [were] upon thine hand. If itseem good unto thee to come with me into Babylon, come; and I will lookwell unto thee: but if it seem ill unto thee to come with me intoBabylon, forbear: behold, all the land [is] before thee: whither itseemeth good and convenient for thee to go, thither go. 

{40:5} Nowwhile he was not yet gone back, [he said,] Go back also to Gedaliah theson of Ahikam the son of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon hath madegovernor over the cities of Judah, and dwell with him among the people:or go wheresoever it seemeth convenient unto thee to go. So the captainof the guard gave him victuals and a reward, and let him go. 

{40:6}Then went Jeremiah unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah; and dweltwith him among the people that were left in the land.   

{40:7} Now when all the captains of the forces which [were] in thefields, [even] they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon hadmade Gedaliah the son of Ahikam governor in the land, and had committedunto him men, and women, and children, and of the poor of the land, ofthem that were not carried away captive to Babylon; 

{40:8} Then theycame to Gedaliah to Mizpah, even Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, andJohanan and Jonathan the sons of Kareah, and Seraiah the son ofTanhumeth, and the sons of Ephai the Netophathite, and Jezaniah the sonof a Maachathite, they and their men. 

{40:9} And Gedaliah the son ofAhikam the son of Shaphan sware unto them and to their men, saying,Fear not to serve the Chaldeans: dwell in the land, and serve the kingof Babylon, and it shall be well with you. 

{40:10} As for me, behold, Iwill dwell at Mizpah to serve the Chaldeans, which will come unto us:but ye, gather ye wine, and summer fruits, and oil, and put [them] inyour vessels, and dwell in your cities that ye have taken. 

{40:11}Likewise when all the Jews that [were] in Moab, and among theAmmonites, and in Edom, and that [were] in all the countries, heardthat the king of Babylon had left a remnant of Judah, and that he hadset over them Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan; 

{40:12}Even all the Jews returned out of all places whither they were driven,and came to the land of Judah, to Gedaliah, unto Mizpah, and gatheredwine and summer fruits very much.   

{40:13} Moreover Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains ofthe forces that [were] in the fields, came to Gedaliah to Mizpah,

{40:14} And said unto him, Dost thou certainly know that Baalis theking of the Ammonites hath sent Ishmael the son of Nethaniah to slaythee? But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam believed them not. 

{40:15} ThenJohanan the son of Kareah spake to Gedaliah in Mizpah secretly, saying,Let me go, I pray thee, and I will slay Ishmael the son of Nethaniah,and no man shall know [it:] wherefore should he slay thee, that all theJews which are gathered unto thee should be scattered, and the remnantin Judah perish? 

{40:16} But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam said untoJohanan the son of Kareah, Thou shalt not do this thing: for thouspeakest falsely of Ishmael.   

{41:1} Now it came to pass in the seventh month, [that] Ishmael theson of Nethaniah the son of Elishama, of the seed royal, and theprinces of the king, even ten men with him, came unto Gedaliah the sonof Ahikam to Mizpah; and there they did eat bread together in Mizpah.

{41:2} Then arose Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and the ten men thatwere with him, and smote Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphanwith the sword, and slew him, whom the king of Babylon had madegovernor over the land. 

{41:3} Ishmael also slew all the Jews that werewith him, [even] with Gedaliah, at Mizpah, and the Chaldeans that werefound there, [and] the men of war. 

{41:4} And it came to pass thesecond day after he had slain Gedaliah, and no man knew [it, ]

{41:5}That there came certain from Shechem, from Shiloh, and from Samaria,[even] fourscore men, having their beards shaven, and their clothesrent, and having cut themselves, with offerings and incense in theirhand, to bring [them] to the house of the LORD. 

{41:6} And Ishmael theson of Nethaniah went forth from Mizpah to meet them, weeping all alongas he went: and it came to pass, as he met them, he said unto them,Come to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam. 

{41:7} And it was [so,] when theycame into the midst of the city, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah slewthem, [and cast them] into the midst of the pit, he, and the men that[were] with him. 

{41:8} But ten men were found among them that saidunto Ishmael, Slay us not: for we have treasures in the field, ofwheat, and of barley, and of oil, and of honey. So he forbare, and slewthem not among their brethren. 

{41:9} Now the pit wherein Ishmael hadcast all the dead bodies of the men, whom he had slain because ofGedaliah, [was] it which Asa the king had made for fear of Baasha kingof Israel: [and] Ishmael the son of Nethaniah filled it with [them thatwere] slain. 

{41:10} Then Ishmael carried away captive all the residueof the people that [were] in Mizpah, [even] the king's daughters, andall the people that remained in Mizpah, whom Nebuzar-adan the captainof the guard had committed to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam: and Ishmaelthe son of Nethaniah carried them away captive, and departed to go overto the Ammonites.   

{41:11} But when Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains ofthe forces that [were] with him, heard of all the evil that Ishmael theson of Nethaniah had done, 

{41:12} Then they took all the men, and wentto fight with Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and found him by the greatwaters that [are] in Gibeon. 

{41:13} Now it came to pass, [that] whenall the people which [were] with Ishmael saw Johanan the son of Kareah,and all the captains of the forces that [were] with him, then they wereglad. 

{41:14} So all the people that Ishmael had carried away captivefrom Mizpah cast about and returned, and went unto Johanan the son ofKareah. 

{41:15} But Ishmael the son of Nethaniah escaped from Johananwith eight men, and went to the Ammonites. 

{41:16} Then took Johananthe son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that [were] withhim, all the remnant of the people whom he had recovered from Ishmaelthe son of Nethaniah, from Mizpah, after [that] he had slain Gedaliahthe son of Ahikam, [even] mighty men of war, and the women, and thechildren, and the eunuchs, whom he had brought again from Gibeon:

{41:17} And they departed, and dwelt in the habitation of Chimham,which is by Bethlehem, to go to enter into Egypt, 

{41:18} Because ofthe Chaldeans: for they were afraid of them, because Ishmael the son ofNethaniah had slain Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, whom the king ofBabylon made governor in the land.   

{42:1} Then all the captains of the forces, and Johanan the son ofKareah, and Jezaniah the son of Hoshaiah, and all the people from theleast even unto the greatest, came near, 

{42:2} And said unto Jeremiahthe prophet, Let, we beseech thee, our supplication be accepted beforethee, and pray for us unto the LORD thy God, [even] for all thisremnant; (for we are left [but] a few of many, as thine eyes do beholdus:) 

{42:3} That the LORD thy God may shew us the way wherein we maywalk, and the thing that we may do. 

{42:4} Then Jeremiah the prophetsaid unto them, I have heard [you;] behold, I will pray unto the LORDyour God according to your words; and it shall come to pass, [that]whatsoever thing the LORD shall answer you, I will declare [it] untoyou; I will keep nothing back from you. 

{42:5} Then they said toJeremiah, The LORD be a true and faithful witness between us, if we donot even according to all things for the which the LORD thy God shallsend thee to us. 

{42:6} Whether [it be] good, or whether [it be] evil,we will obey the voice of the LORD our God, to whom we send thee; thatit may be well with us, when we obey the voice of the LORD our God.   

{42:7} And it came to pass after ten days, that the word of the LORDcame unto Jeremiah. 

{42:8} Then called he Johanan the son of Kareah,and all the captains of the forces which [were] with him, and all thepeople from the least even to the greatest, 

{42:9} And said unto them,Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, unto whom ye sent me to presentyour supplication before him; 

{42:10} If ye will still abide in thisland, then will I build you, and not pull [you] down, and I will plantyou, and not pluck [you] up: for I repent me of the evil that I havedone unto you. 

{42:11} Be not afraid of the king of Babylon, of whom yeare afraid; be not afraid of him, saith the LORD: for I [am] with youto save you, and to deliver you from his hand. 

{42:12} And I will shewmercies unto you, that he may have mercy upon you, and cause you toreturn to your own land.   

{42:13} But if ye say, We will not dwell in this land, neither obeythe voice of the LORD your God, 

{42:14} Saying, No; but we will go intothe land of Egypt, where we shall see no war, nor hear the sound of thetrumpet, nor have hunger of bread; and there will we dwell: 

{42:15} Andnow therefore hear the word of the LORD, ye remnant of Judah; Thussaith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; If ye wholly set your facesto enter into Egypt, and go to sojourn there; 

{42:16} Then it shallcome to pass, [that] the sword, which ye feared, shall overtake youthere in the land of Egypt, and the famine, whereof ye were afraid,shall follow close after you there in Egypt; and there ye shall die.

{42:17} So shall it be with all the men that set their faces to go intoEgypt to sojourn there; they shall die by the sword, by the famine, andby the pestilence: and none of them shall remain or escape from theevil that I will bring upon them. 

{42:18} For thus saith the LORD ofhosts, the God of Israel; As mine anger and my fury hath been pouredforth upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem; so shall my fury be pouredforth upon you, when ye shall enter into Egypt: and ye shall be anexecration, and an astonishment, and a curse, and a reproach; and yeshall see this place no more.   

{42:19} The LORD hath said concerning you, O ye remnant of Judah; Goye not into Egypt: know certainly that I have admonished you this day.

{42:20} For ye dissembled in your hearts, when ye sent me unto the LORDyour God, saying, Pray for us unto the LORD our God; and according untoall that the LORD our God shall say, so declare unto us, and we will do[it. ]

{42:21} And [now] I have this day declared [it] to you; but yehave not obeyed the voice of the LORD your God, nor any [thing] for thewhich he hath sent me unto you. 

{42:22} Now therefore know certainlythat ye shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence,in the place whither ye desire to go [and] to sojourn.   

{43:1} And it came to pass, [that] when Jeremiah had made an end ofspeaking unto all the people all the words of the LORD their God, forwhich the LORD their God had sent him to them, [even] all these words,

{43:2} Then spake Azariah the son of Hoshaiah, and Johanan the son ofKareah, and all the proud men, saying unto Jeremiah, Thou speakestfalsely: the LORD our God hath not sent thee to say, Go not into Egyptto sojourn there: 

{43:3} But Baruch the son of Neriah setteth thee onagainst us, for to deliver us into the hand of the Chaldeans, that theymight put us to death, and carry us away captives into Babylon. 

{43:4}So Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces, andall the people, obeyed not the voice of the LORD, to dwell in the landof Judah. 

{43:5} But Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains ofthe forces, took all the remnant of Judah, that were returned from allnations, whither they had been driven, to dwell in the land of Judah;

{43:6} [Even] men, and women, and children, and the king's daughters,and every person that Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard had leftwith Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Jeremiah theprophet, and Baruch the son of Neriah. 

{43:7} So they came into theland of Egypt: for they obeyed not the voice of the LORD: thus camethey [even] to Tahpanhes.   

{43:8} Then came the word of the LORD unto Jeremiah in Tahpanhes,saying, 

{43:9} Take great stones in thine hand, and hide them in theclay in the brickkiln, which [is] at the entry of Pharaoh's house inTahpanhes, in the sight of the men of Judah; 

{43:10} And say unto them,Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will sendand take Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon, my servant, and will sethis throne upon these stones that I have hid; and he shall spread hisroyal pavilion over them. 

{43:11} And when he cometh, he shall smitethe land of Egypt, [and deliver] such [as are] for death to death; andsuch [as are] for captivity to captivity; and such [as are] for thesword to the sword. 

{43:12} And I will kindle a fire in the houses ofthe gods of Egypt; and he shall burn them, and carry them awaycaptives: and he shall array himself with the land of Egypt, as ashepherd putteth on his garment; and he shall go forth from thence inpeace. 

{43:13} He shall break also the images of Beth-shemesh, that[is] in the land of Egypt; and the houses of the gods of the Egyptiansshall he burn with fire.   

{44:1} The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the Jews whichdwell in the land of Egypt, which dwell at Migdol, and at Tahpanhes,and at Noph, and in the country of Pathros, saying, 

{44:2} Thus saiththe LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Ye have seen all the evil that Ihave brought upon Jerusalem, and upon all the cities of Judah; and,behold, this day they [are] a desolation, and no man dwelleth therein,

{44:3} Because of their wickedness which they have committed to provokeme to anger, in that they went to burn incense, [and] to serve othergods, whom they knew not, [neither] they, ye, nor your fathers. 

{44:4}Howbeit I sent unto you all my servants the prophets, rising early andsending [them,] saying, Oh, do not this abominable thing that I hate.

{44:5} But they hearkened not, nor inclined their ear to turn fromtheir wickedness, to burn no incense unto other gods. 

{44:6} Whereforemy fury and mine anger was poured forth, and was kindled in the citiesof Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem; and they are wasted [and]desolate, as at this day. 

{44:7} Therefore now thus saith the LORD, theGod of hosts, the God of Israel; Wherefore commit ye [this] great evilagainst your souls, to cut off from you man and woman, child andsuckling, out of Judah, to leave you none to remain; 

{44:8} In that yeprovoke me unto wrath with the works of your hands, burning incenseunto other gods in the land of Egypt, whither ye be gone to dwell, thatye might cut yourselves off, and that ye might be a curse and areproach among all the nations of the earth? 

{44:9} Have ye forgottenthe wickedness of your fathers, and the wickedness of the kings ofJudah, and the wickedness of their wives, and your own wickedness, andthe wickedness of your wives, which they have committed in the land ofJudah, and in the streets of Jerusalem? 

{44:10} They are not humbled[even] unto this day, neither have they feared, nor walked in my law,nor in my statutes, that I set before you and before your fathers.   

{44:11} Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel;Behold, I will set my face against you for evil, and to cut off allJudah. 

{44:12} And I will take the remnant of Judah, that have settheir faces to go into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, and theyshall all be consumed, [and] fall in the land of Egypt; they shall[even] be consumed by the sword and by the famine: they shall die, fromthe least even unto the greatest, by the sword [and] by the famine: andthey shall be an execration, [and] an astonishment, and a curse, and areproach. 

{44:13} For I will punish them that dwell in the land ofEgypt, as I have punished Jerusalem, by the sword, by the famine, andby the pestilence: 

{44:14} So that none of the remnant of Judah, whichare gone into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, shall escape orremain, that they should return into the land of Judah, to the whichthey have a desire to return to dwell there: for none shall return butsuch as shall escape.   

{44:15} Then all the men which knew that their wives had burnedincense unto other gods, and all the women that stood by, a greatmultitude, even all the people that dwelt in the land of Egypt, inPathros, answered Jeremiah, saying, 

{44:16} [As for] the word that thouhast spoken unto us in the name of the LORD, we will not hearken untothee. 

{44:17} But we will certainly do whatsoever thing goeth forth outof our own mouth, to burn incense unto the queen of heaven, and to pourout drink offerings unto her, as we have done, we, and our fathers, ourkings, and our princes, in the cities of Judah, and in the streets ofJerusalem: for [then] had we plenty of victuals, and were well, and sawno evil. 

{44:18} But since we left off to burn incense to the queen ofheaven, and to pour out drink offerings unto her, we have wanted all[things,] and have been consumed by the sword and by the famine.

{44:19} And when we burned incense to the queen of heaven, and pouredout drink offerings unto her, did we make her cakes to worship her, andpour out drink offerings unto her, without our men?   

{44:20} Then Jeremiah said unto all the people, to the men, and tothe women, and to all the people which had given him [that] answer,saying, 

{44:21} The incense that ye burned in the cities of Judah, andin the streets of Jerusalem, ye, and your fathers, your kings, and yourprinces, and the people of the land, did not the LORD remember them,and came it [not] into his mind? 

{44:22} So that the LORD could nolonger bear, because of the evil of your doings, [and] because of theabominations which ye have committed; therefore is your land adesolation, and an astonishment, and a curse, without an inhabitant, asat this day. 

{44:23} Because ye have burned incense, and because yehave sinned against the LORD, and have not obeyed the voice of theLORD, nor walked in his law, nor in his statutes, nor in histestimonies; therefore this evil is happened unto you, as at this day.

{44:24} Moreover Jeremiah said unto all the people, and to all thewomen, Hear the word of the LORD, all Judah that [are] in the land ofEgypt: 

{44:25} Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, saying;Ye and your wives have both spoken with your mouths, and fulfilled withyour hand, saying, We will surely perform our vows that we have vowed,to burn incense to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offeringsunto her: ye will surely accomplish your vows, and surely perform yourvows. 

{44:26} Therefore hear ye the word of the LORD, all Judah thatdwell in the land of Egypt; Behold, I have sworn by my great name,saith the LORD, that my name shall no more be named in the mouth of anyman of Judah in all the land of Egypt, saying, The Lord GOD liveth.

{44:27} Behold, I will watch over them for evil, and not for good: andall the men of Judah that are in the land of Egypt shall be consumed bythe sword and by the famine, until there be an end of them. 

{44:28} Yeta small number that escape the sword shall return out of the land ofEgypt into the land of Judah, and all the remnant of Judah, that aregone into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, shall know whose wordsshall stand, mine, or theirs.   

{44:29} And this [shall be] a sign unto you, saith the LORD, that Iwill punish you in this place, that ye may know that my words shallsurely stand against you for evil: 

{44:30} Thus saith the LORD; Behold,I will give Pharaoh-hophra king of Egypt into the hand of his enemies,and into the hand of them that seek his life; as I gave Zedekiah kingof Judah into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, his enemy,and that sought his life.   

{45:1} The word that Jeremiah the prophet spake unto Baruch the sonof Neriah, when he had written these words in a book at the mouth ofJeremiah, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king ofJudah, saying, 

{45:2} Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, untothee, O Baruch; 

{45:3} Thou didst say, Woe is me now! for the LORD hathadded grief to my sorrow; I fainted in my sighing, and I find no rest.   

{45:4} Thus shalt thou say unto him, The LORD saith thus; Behold,[that] which I have built will I break down, and that which I haveplanted I will pluck up, even this whole land. 

{45:5} And seekest thougreat things for thyself? seek [them] not: for, behold, I will bringevil upon all flesh, saith the LORD: but thy life will I give unto theefor a prey in all places whither thou goest.   

{46:1} The word of the LORD which came to Jeremiah the prophetagainst the Gentiles; 

{46:2} Against Egypt, against the army ofPharaoh-necho king of Egypt, which was by the river Euphrates inCarchemish, which Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon smote in the fourthyear of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah. 

{46:3} Order ye thebuckler and shield, and draw near to battle. 

{46:4} Harness the horses;and get up, ye horsemen, and stand forth with [your] helmets; furbishthe spears, [and] put on the brigandines. 

{46:5} Wherefore have I seenthem dismayed [and] turned away back? and their mighty ones are beatendown, and are fled apace, and look not back: [for] fear [was] roundabout, saith the LORD. 

{46:6} Let not the swift flee away, nor themighty man escape; they shall stumble, and fall toward the north by theriver Euphrates. 

{46:7} Who [is] this [that] cometh up as a flood,whose waters are moved as the rivers? 

{46:8} Egypt riseth up like aflood, and [his] waters are moved like the rivers; and he saith, I willgo up, [and] will cover the earth; I will destroy the city and theinhabitants thereof. 

{46:9} Come up, ye horses; and rage, ye chariots;and let the mighty men come forth; the Ethiopians and the Libyans, thathandle the shield; and the Lydians, that handle [and] bend the bow.

{46:10} For this [is] the day of the Lord GOD of hosts, a day ofvengeance, that he may avenge him of his adversaries: and the swordshall devour, and it shall be satiate and made drunk with their blood:for the Lord GOD of hosts hath a sacrifice in the north country by theriver Euphrates. 

{46:11} Go up into Gilead, and take balm, O virgin,the daughter of Egypt: in vain shalt thou use many medicines; [for]thou shalt not be cured. 

{46:12} The nations have heard of thy shame,and thy cry hath filled the land: for the mighty man hath stumbledagainst the mighty, [and] they are fallen both together.   

{46:13} The word that the LORD spake to Jeremiah the prophet, howNebuchadrezzar king of Babylon should come [and] smite the land ofEgypt. 

{46:14} Declare ye in Egypt, and publish in Migdol, and publishin Noph and in Tahpanhes: say ye, Stand fast, and prepare thee; for thesword shall devour round about thee. 

{46:15} Why are thy valiant [men]swept away? they stood not, because the LORD did drive them. 

{46:16} Hemade many to fall, yea, one fell upon another: and they said, Arise,and let us go again to our own people, and to the land of our nativity,from the oppressing sword. 

{46:17} They did cry there, Pharaoh king ofEgypt [is but] a noise; he hath passed the time appointed. 

{46:18} [As]I live, saith the King, whose name [is] the LORD of hosts, Surely asTabor [is] among the mountains, and as Carmel by the sea, [so] shall hecome. 

{46:19} O thou daughter dwelling in Egypt, furnish thyself to gointo captivity: for Noph shall be waste and desolate without aninhabitant. 

{46:20} Egypt [is like] a very fair heifer, [but]destruction cometh; it cometh out of the north. 

{46:21} Also her hiredmen [are] in the midst of her like fatted bullocks; for they also areturned back, [and] are fled away together: they did not stand, becausethe day of their calamity was come upon them, [and] the time of theirvisitation. 

{46:22} The voice thereof shall go like a serpent; for theyshall march with an army, and come against her with axes, as hewers ofwood. 

{46:23} They shall cut down her forest, saith the LORD, though itcannot be searched; because they are more than the grasshoppers, and[are] innumerable. 

{46:24} The daughter of Egypt shall be confounded;she shall be delivered into the hand of the people of the north.

{46:25} The LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, saith; Behold, I willpunish the multitude of No, and Pharaoh, and Egypt, with their gods,and their kings; even Pharaoh, and [all] them that trust in him:

{46:26} And I will deliver them into the hand of those that seek theirlives, and into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and intothe hand of his servants: and afterward it shall be inhabited, as inthe days of old, saith the LORD.   

{46:27} But fear not thou, O my servant Jacob, and be not dismayed,O Israel: for, behold, I will save thee from afar off, and thy seedfrom the land of their captivity; and Jacob shall return, and be inrest and at ease, and none shall make [him] afraid. 

{46:28} Fear thounot, O Jacob my servant, saith the LORD: for I [am] with thee; for Iwill make a full end of all the nations whither I have driven thee: butI will not make a full end of thee, but correct thee in measure; yetwill I not leave thee wholly unpunished.   

{47:1} The word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah the prophetagainst the Philistines, before that Pharaoh smote Gaza. 

{47:2} Thussaith the LORD; Behold, waters rise up out of the north, and shall bean overflowing flood, and shall overflow the land, and all that istherein; the city, and them that dwell therein: then the men shall cry,and all the inhabitants of the land shall howl. 

{47:3} At the noise ofthe stamping of the hoofs of his strong [horses,] at the rushing of hischariots, [and at] the rumbling of his wheels, the fathers shall notlook back to [their] children for feebleness of hands; 

{47:4} Becauseof the day that cometh to spoil all the Philistines, [and] to cut offfrom Tyrus and Zidon every helper that remaineth: for the LORD willspoil the Philistines, the remnant of the country of Caphtor. 

{47:5}Baldness is come upon Gaza; Ashkelon is cut off [with] the remnant oftheir valley: how long wilt thou cut thyself? 

{47:6} O thou sword ofthe LORD, how long [will it be] ere thou be quiet? put up thyself intothy scabbard, rest, and be still. 

{47:7} How can it be quiet, seeingthe LORD hath given it a charge against Ashkelon, and against the seashore? there hath he appointed it.   

{48:1} Against Moab thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel;Woe unto Nebo! for it is spoiled: Kiriathaim is confounded [and] taken:Misgab is confounded and dismayed. 

{48:2} [There shall be] no morepraise of Moab: in Heshbon they have devised evil against it; come, andlet us cut it off from [being] a nation. Also thou shalt be cut down, OMadmen; the sword shall pursue thee. 

{48:3} A voice of crying [shallbe] from Horonaim, spoiling and great destruction. 

{48:4} Moab isdestroyed; her little ones have caused a cry to be heard. 

{48:5} For inthe going up of Luhith continual weeping shall go up; for in the goingdown of Horonaim the enemies have heard a cry of destruction. 

{48:6}Flee, save your lives, and be like the heath in the wilderness.   

{48:7} For because thou hast trusted in thy works and in thytreasures, thou shalt also be taken: and Chemosh shall go forth intocaptivity [with] his priests and his princes together. 

{48:8} And thespoiler shall come upon every city, and no city shall escape: thevalley also shall perish, and the plain shall be destroyed, as the LORDhath spoken. 

{48:9} Give wings unto Moab, that it may flee and getaway: for the cities thereof shall be desolate, without any to dwelltherein. 

{48:10} Cursed [be] he that doeth the work of the LORDdeceitfully, and cursed [be] he that keepeth back his sword from blood.   

{48:11} Moab hath been at ease from his youth, and he hath settledon his lees, and hath not been emptied from vessel to vessel, neitherhath he gone into captivity: therefore his taste remained in him, andhis scent is not changed. 

{48:12} Therefore, behold, the days come,saith the LORD, that I will send unto him wanderers, that shall causehim to wander, and shall empty his vessels, and break their bottles.

{48:13} And Moab shall be ashamed of Chemosh, as the house of Israelwas ashamed of Bethel their confidence.   

{48:14} How say ye, We [are] mighty and strong men for the war?

{48:15} Moab is spoiled, and gone up [out of] her cities, and hischosen young men are gone down to the slaughter, saith the King, whosename [is] the LORD of hosts. 

{48:16} The calamity of Moab [is] near tocome, and his affliction hasteth fast. 

{48:17} All ye that are abouthim, bemoan him; and all ye that know his name, say, How is the strongstaff broken, [and] the beautiful rod! 

{48:18} Thou daughter that dostinhabit Dibon, come down from [thy] glory, and sit in thirst; for thespoiler of Moab shall come upon thee, [and] he shall destroy thy strongholds. 

{48:19} O inhabitant of Aroer, stand by the way, and espy; askhim that fleeth, and her that escapeth, [and] say, What is done?

{48:20} Moab is confounded; for it is broken down: howl and cry; andtell ye it in Arnon, that Moab is spoiled, 

{48:21} And judgment is comeupon the plain country; upon Holon, and upon Jahazah, and uponMephaath, 

{48:22} And upon Dibon, and upon Nebo, and uponBeth-diblathaim, 

{48:23} And upon Kiriathaim, and upon Beth-gamul, andupon Beth-meon, 

{48:24} And upon Kerioth, and upon Bozrah, and upon allthe cities of the land of Moab, far or near. 

{48:25} The horn of Moabis cut off, and his arm is broken, saith the LORD.   

{48:26} Make ye him drunken: for he magnified [himself] against theLORD: Moab also shall wallow in his vomit, and he also shall be inderision. 

{48:27} For was not Israel a derision unto thee? was he foundamong thieves? for since thou spakest of him, thou skippedst for joy.

{48:28} O ye that dwell in Moab, leave the cities, and dwell in therock, and be like the dove [that] maketh her nest in the sides of thehole's mouth. 

{48:29} We have heard the pride of Moab, (he is exceedingproud) his loftiness, and his arrogancy, and his pride, and thehaughtiness of his heart. 

{48:30} I know his wrath, saith the LORD; but[it shall] not [be] so; his lies shall not so effect [it. ]

{48:31}Therefore will I howl for Moab, and I will cry out for all Moab; [mineheart] shall mourn for the men of Kir- heres. 

{48:32} O vine of Sibmah,I will weep for thee with the weeping of Jazer: thy plants are goneover the sea, they reach [even] to the sea of Jazer: the spoiler isfallen upon thy summer fruits and upon thy vintage. 

{48:33} And joy andgladness is taken from the plentiful field, and from the land of Moab;and I have caused wine to fail from the winepresses: none shall treadwith shouting; [their] shouting [shall be] no shouting. 

{48:34} Fromthe cry of Heshbon [even] unto Elealeh, [and even] unto Jahaz, havethey uttered their voice, from Zoar [even] unto Horonaim, [as] anheifer of three years old: for the waters also of Nimrim shall bedesolate. 

{48:35} Moreover I will cause to cease in Moab, saith theLORD, him that offereth in the high places, and him that burnethincense to his gods. 

{48:36} Therefore mine heart shall sound for Moablike pipes, and mine heart shall sound like pipes for the men ofKir-heres: because the riches [that] he hath gotten are perished.

{48:37} For every head [shall be] bald, and every beard clipped: uponall the hands [shall be] cuttings, and upon the loins sackcloth.

{48:38} [There shall be] lamentation generally upon all the housetopsof Moab, and in the streets thereof: for I have broken Moab like avessel wherein [is] no pleasure, saith the LORD. 

{48:39} They shallhowl, [saying,] How is it broken down! how hath Moab turned the backwith shame! so shall Moab be a derision and a dismaying to all themabout him. 

{48:40} For thus saith the LORD; Behold, he shall fly as aneagle, and shall spread his wings over Moab. 

{48:41} Kerioth is taken,and the strong holds are surprised, and the mighty men's hearts in Moabat that day shall be as the heart of a woman in her pangs. 

{48:42} AndMoab shall be destroyed from [being] a people, because he hathmagnified [himself] against the LORD. 

{48:43} Fear, and the pit, andthe snare, [shall be] upon thee, O inhabitant of Moab, saith the LORD.

{48:44} He that fleeth from the fear shall fall into the pit; and hethat getteth up out of the pit shall be taken in the snare: for I willbring upon it, [even] upon Moab, the year of their visitation, saiththe LORD. 

{48:45} They that fled stood under the shadow of Heshbonbecause of the force: but a fire shall come forth out of Heshbon, and aflame from the midst of Sihon, and shall devour the corner of Moab, andthe crown of the head of the tumultuous ones. 

{48:46} Woe be unto thee,O Moab! the people of Chemosh perisheth: for thy sons are takencaptives, and thy daughters captives. 

{48:47} Yet will I bring againthe captivity of Moab in the latter days, saith the LORD. Thus far [is]the judgment of Moab.   

{49:1} Concerning the Ammonites, thus saith the LORD; Hath Israel nosons? hath he no heir? why [then] doth their king inherit Gad, and hispeople dwell in his cities? 

{49:2} Therefore, behold, the days come,saith the LORD, that I will cause an alarm of war to be heard in Rabbahof the Ammonites; and it shall be a desolate heap, and her daughtersshall be burned with fire: then shall Israel be heir unto them thatwere his heirs, saith the LORD. 

{49:3} Howl, O Heshbon, for Ai isspoiled: cry, ye daughters of Rabbah, gird you with sackcloth; lament,and run to and fro by the hedges; for their king shall go intocaptivity, [and] his priests and his princes together. 

{49:4} Whereforegloriest thou in the valleys, thy flowing valley, O backslidingdaughter? that trusted in her treasures, [saying,] Who shall come untome? 

{49:5} Behold, I will bring a fear upon thee, saith the Lord GOD ofhosts, from all those that be about thee; and ye shall be driven outevery man right forth; and none shall gather up him that wandereth.

{49:6} And afterward I will bring again the captivity of the childrenof Ammon, saith the LORD.   

{49:7} Concerning Edom, thus saith the LORD of hosts; [Is] wisdom nomore in Teman? is counsel perished from the prudent? is their wisdomvanished? 

{49:8} Flee ye, turn back, dwell deep, O inhabitants ofDedan; for I will bring the calamity of Esau upon him, the time [that]I will visit him. 

{49:9} If grapegatherers come to thee, would they notleave [some] gleaning grapes? if thieves by night, they will destroytill they have enough. 

{49:10} But I have made Esau bare, I haveuncovered his secret places, and he shall not be able to hide himself:his seed is spoiled, and his brethren, and his neighbours, and he isnot. 

{49:11} Leave thy fatherless children, I will preserve [them]alive; and let thy widows trust in me. 

{49:12} For thus saith the LORD;Behold, they whose judgment [was] not to drink of the cup haveassuredly drunken; and [art] thou he [that] shall altogether gounpunished? thou shalt not go unpunished, but thou shalt surely drink[of it. ]

{49:13} For I have sworn by myself, saith the LORD, thatBozrah shall become a desolation, a reproach, a waste, and a curse; andall the cities thereof shall be perpetual wastes. 

{49:14} I have hearda rumour from the LORD, and an ambassador is sent unto the heathen,[saying,] Gather ye together, and come against her, and rise up to thebattle. 

{49:15} For, lo, I will make thee small among the heathen,[and] despised among men. 

{49:16} Thy terribleness hath deceived thee,[and] the pride of thine heart, O thou that dwellest in the clefts ofthe rock, that holdest the height of the hill: though thou shouldestmake thy nest as high as the eagle, I will bring thee down from thence,saith the LORD. 

{49:17} Also Edom shall be a desolation: every one thatgoeth by it shall be astonished, and shall hiss at all the plaguesthereof. 

{49:18} As in the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah and theneighbour [cities] thereof, saith the LORD, no man shall abide there,neither shall a son of man dwell in it. 

{49:19} Behold, he shall comeup like a lion from the swelling of Jordan against the habitation ofthe strong: but I will suddenly make him run away from her: and who[is] a chosen [man, that] I may appoint over her? for who [is] like me?and who will appoint me the time? and who [is] that shepherd that willstand before me? 

{49:20} Therefore hear the counsel of the LORD, thathe hath taken against Edom; and his purposes, that he hath purposedagainst the inhabitants of Teman: Surely the least of the flock shalldraw them out: surely he shall make their habitations desolate withthem. 

{49:21} The earth is moved at the noise of their fall, at the crythe noise thereof was heard in the Red sea. 

{49:22} Behold, he shallcome up and fly as the eagle, and spread his wings over Bozrah: and atthat day shall the heart of the mighty men of Edom be as the heart of awoman in her pangs.   

{49:23} Concerning Damascus. Hamath is confounded, and Arpad: forthey have heard evil tidings: they are fainthearted; [there is] sorrowon the sea; it cannot be quiet. 

{49:24} Damascus is waxed feeble, [and]turneth herself to flee, and fear hath seized on [her:] anguish andsorrows have taken her, as a woman in travail. 

{49:25} How is the cityof praise not left, the city of my joy! 

{49:26} Therefore her young menshall fall in her streets, and all the men of war shall be cut off inthat day, saith the LORD of hosts. 

{49:27} And I will kindle a fire inthe wall of Damascus, and it shall consume the palaces of Ben-hadad.   

{49:28} Concerning Kedar, and concerning the kingdoms of Hazor,which Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon shall smite, thus saith the LORD;Arise ye, go up to Kedar, and spoil the men of the east. 

{49:29} Theirtents and their flocks shall they take away: they shall take tothemselves their curtains, and all their vessels, and their camels; andthey shall cry unto them, Fear [is] on every side.   

{49:30} Flee, get you far off, dwell deep, O ye inhabitants ofHazor, saith the LORD; for Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon hath takencounsel against you, and hath conceived a purpose against you. 

{49:31}Arise, get you up unto the wealthy nation, that dwelleth without care,saith the LORD, which have neither gates nor bars, [which] dwell alone.

{49:32} And their camels shall be a booty, and the multitude of theircattle a spoil: and I will scatter into all winds them [that are] inthe utmost corners; and I will bring their calamity from all sidesthereof, saith the LORD. 

{49:33} And Hazor shall be a dwelling fordragons, [and] a desolation for ever: there shall no man abide there,nor [any] son of man dwell in it.   

{49:34} The word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah the prophetagainst Elam in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah,saying, 

{49:35} Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Behold, I will break thebow of Elam, the chief of their might. 

{49:36} And upon Elam will Ibring the four winds from the four quarters of heaven, and will scatterthem toward all those winds; and there shall be no nation whither theoutcasts of Elam shall not come. 

{49:37} For I will cause Elam to bedismayed before their enemies, and before them that seek their life:and I will bring evil upon them [even] my fierce anger, saith the LORD;and I will send the sword after them, till I have consumed them:

{49:38} And I will set my throne in Elam, and will destroy from thencethe king and the princes, saith the LORD.   

{49:39} But it shall come to pass in the latter days, [that] I willbring again the captivity of Elam, saith the LORD.   

{50:1} The word that the LORD spake against Babylon [and] againstthe land of the Chaldeans by Jeremiah the prophet. 

{50:2} Declare yeamong the nations, and publish, and set up a standard; publish, [and]conceal not: say, Babylon is taken, Bel is confounded, Merodach isbroken in pieces; her idols are confounded, her images are broken inpieces. 

{50:3} For out of the north there cometh up a nation againsther, which shall make her land desolate, and none shall dwell therein:they shall remove, they shall depart, both man and beast.   

{50:4} In those days, and in that time, saith the LORD, the childrenof Israel shall come, they and the children of Judah together, goingand weeping: they shall go, and seek the LORD their God. 

{50:5} Theyshall ask the way to Zion with their faces thitherward, [saying,] Come,and let us join ourselves to the LORD in a perpetual covenant [that]shall not be forgotten. 

{50:6} My people hath been lost sheep: theirshepherds have caused them to go astray, they have turned them away[on] the mountains: they have gone from mountain to hill, they haveforgotten their restingplace. 

{50:7} All that found them have devouredthem: and their adversaries said, We offend not, because they havesinned against the LORD, the habitation of justice, even the LORD, thehope of their fathers. 

{50:8} Remove out of the midst of Babylon, andgo forth out of the land of the Chaldeans, and be as the he goatsbefore the flocks.   

{50:9} For, lo, I will raise and cause to come up against Babylon anassembly of great nations from the north country: and they shall setthemselves in array against her; from thence she shall be taken: theirarrows [shall be] as of a mighty expert man; none shall return in vain.

{50:10} And Chaldea shall be a spoil: all that spoil her shall besatisfied, saith the LORD. 

{50:11} Because ye were glad, because yerejoiced, O ye destroyers of mine heritage, because ye are grown fat asthe heifer at grass, and bellow as bulls; 

{50:12} Your mother shall besore confounded; she that bare you shall be ashamed: behold, thehindermost of the nations [shall be] a wilderness, a dry land, and adesert. 

{50:13} Because of the wrath of the LORD it shall not beinhabited, but it shall be wholly desolate: every one that goeth byBabylon shall be astonished, and hiss at all her plagues. 

{50:14} Putyourselves in array against Babylon round about: all ye that bend thebow, shoot at her, spare no arrows: for she hath sinned against theLORD. 

{50:15} Shout against her round about: she hath given her hand:her foundations are fallen, her walls are thrown down: for it [is] thevengeance of the LORD: take vengeance upon her; as she hath done, dounto her. 

{50:16} Cut off the sower from Babylon, and him that handleththe sickle in the time of harvest: for fear of the oppressing swordthey shall turn every one to his people, and they shall flee every oneto his own land.   

{50:17} Israel [is] a scattered sheep; the lions have driven [him]away: first the king of Assyria hath devoured him; and last thisNebuchadrezzar king of Babylon hath broken his bones. 

{50:18} Thereforethus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will punishthe king of Babylon and his land, as I have punished the king ofAssyria. 

{50:19} And I will bring Israel again to his habitation, andhe shall feed on Carmel and Bashan, and his soul shall be satisfiedupon mount Ephraim and Gilead. 

{50:20} In those days, and in that time,saith the LORD, the iniquity of Israel shall be sought for, and [thereshall be] none; and the sins of Judah, and they shall not be found: forI will pardon them whom I reserve.   

{50:21} Go up against the land of Merathaim, [even] against it, andagainst the inhabitants of Pekod: waste and utterly destroy after them,saith the LORD, and do according to all that I have commanded thee.

{50:22} A sound of battle [is] in the land, and of great destruction.

{50:23} How is the hammer of the whole earth cut asunder and broken!how is Babylon become a desolation among the nations! 

{50:24} I havelaid a snare for thee, and thou art also taken, O Babylon, and thouwast not aware: thou art found, and also caught, because thou haststriven against the LORD. 

{50:25} The LORD hath opened his armoury, andhath brought forth the weapons of his indignation: for this [is] thework of the Lord GOD of hosts in the land of the Chaldeans. 

{50:26}Come against her from the utmost border, open her storehouses: cast herup as heaps, and destroy her utterly: let nothing of her be left.

{50:27} Slay all her bullocks; let them go down to the slaughter: woeunto them! for their day is come, the time of their visitation. 

{50:28}The voice of them that flee and escape out of the land of Babylon, todeclare in Zion the vengeance of the LORD our God, the vengeance of histemple. 

{50:29} Call together the archers against Babylon: all ye thatbend the bow, camp against it round about; let none thereof escape:recompense her according to her work; according to all that she hathdone, do unto her: for she hath been proud against the LORD, againstthe Holy One of Israel. 

{50:30} Therefore shall her young men fall inthe streets, and all her men of war shall be cut off in that day, saiththe LORD. 

{50:31} Behold, I [am] against thee, [O thou] most proud,saith the Lord GOD of hosts: for thy day is come, the time [that] Iwill visit thee. 

{50:32} And the most proud shall stumble and fall, andnone shall raise him up: and I will kindle a fire in his cities, and itshall devour all round about him.   

{50:33} Thus saith the LORD of hosts; The children of Israel and thechildren of Judah [were] oppressed together: and all that took themcaptives held them fast; they refused to let them go. 

{50:34} TheirRedeemer [is] strong; the LORD of hosts [is] his name: he shallthroughly plead their cause, that he may give rest to the land, anddisquiet the inhabitants of Babylon.   

{50:35} A sword [is] upon the Chaldeans, saith the LORD, and uponthe inhabitants of Babylon, and upon her princes, and upon her wise[men. ]

{50:36} A sword [is] upon the liars; and they shall dote: asword [is] upon her mighty men; and they shall be dismayed. 

{50:37} Asword [is] upon their horses, and upon their chariots, and upon all themingled people that [are] in the midst of her; and they shall become aswomen: a sword [is] upon her treasures; and they shall be robbed.

{50:38} A drought [is] upon her waters; and they shall be dried up: forit [is] the land of graven images, and they are mad upon [their] idols.

{50:39} Therefore the wild beasts of the desert with the wild beasts ofthe islands shall dwell [there,] and the owls shall dwell therein: andit shall be no more inhabited for ever; neither shall it be dwelt infrom generation to generation. 

{50:40} As God overthrew Sodom andGomorrah and the neighbour [cities] thereof, saith the LORD; [so] shallno man abide there, neither shall any son of man dwell therein. 

{50:41}Behold, a people shall come from the north, and a great nation, andmany kings shall be raised up from the coasts of the earth. 

{50:42}They shall hold the bow and the lance: they [are] cruel, and will notshew mercy: their voice shall roar like the sea, and they shall rideupon horses, [every one] put in array, like a man to the battle,against thee, O daughter of Babylon. 

{50:43} The king of Babylon hathheard the report of them, and his hands waxed feeble: anguish took holdof him, [and] pangs as of a woman in travail. 

{50:44} Behold, he shallcome up like a lion from the swelling of Jordan unto the habitation ofthe strong: but I will make them suddenly run away from her: and who[is] a chosen [man, that] I may appoint over her? for who [is] like me?and who will appoint me the time? and who [is] that shepherd that willstand before me? 

{50:45} Therefore hear ye the counsel of the LORD,that he hath taken against Babylon; and his purposes, that he hathpurposed against the land of the Chaldeans: Surely the least of theflock shall draw them out: surely he shall make [their] habitationdesolate with them. 

{50:46} At the noise of the taking of Babylon theearth is moved, and the cry is heard among the nations.   

{51:1} Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will raise up against Babylon,and against them that dwell in the midst of them that rise up againstme, a destroying wind; 

{51:2} And will send unto Babylon fanners, thatshall fan her, and shall empty her land: for in the day of trouble theyshall be against her round about. 

{51:3} Against [him that] bendeth letthe archer bend his bow, and against [him that] lifteth himself up inhis brigandine: and spare ye not her young men; destroy ye utterly allher host. 

{51:4} Thus the slain shall fall in the land of theChaldeans, and [they that are] thrust through in her streets. 

{51:5}For Israel [hath] not [been] forsaken, nor Judah of his God, of theLORD of hosts; though their land was filled with sin against the HolyOne of Israel. 

{51:6} Flee out of the midst of Babylon, and deliverevery man his soul: be not cut off in her iniquity; for this [is] thetime of the LORD'S vengeance; he will render unto her a recompence.

{51:7} Babylon [hath been] a golden cup in the LORD'S hand, that madeall the earth drunken: the nations have drunken of her wine; thereforethe nations are mad. 

{51:8} Babylon is suddenly fallen and destroyed:howl for her; take balm for her pain, if so she may be healed. 

{51:9}We would have healed Babylon, but she is not healed: forsake her, andlet us go every one into his own country: for her judgment reachethunto heaven, and is lifted up [even] to the skies. 

{51:10} The LORDhath brought forth our righteousness: come, and let us declare in Zionthe work of the LORD our God. 

{51:11} Make bright the arrows; gatherthe shields: the LORD hath raised up the spirit of the kings of theMedes: for his device [is] against Babylon, to destroy it; because it[is] the vengeance of the LORD, the vengeance of his temple. 

{51:12}Set up the standard upon the walls of Babylon, make the watch strong,set up the watchmen, prepare the ambushes: for the LORD hath bothdevised and done that which he spake against the inhabitants ofBabylon. 

{51:13} O thou that dwellest upon many waters, abundant intreasures, thine end is come, [and] the measure of thy covetousness.

{51:14} The LORD of hosts hath sworn by himself, [saying,] Surely Iwill fill thee with men, as with caterpillers; and they shall lift up ashout against thee. 

{51:15} He hath made the earth by his power, hehath established the world by his wisdom, and hath stretched out theheaven by his understanding. 

{51:16} When he uttereth [his] voice,[there is] a multitude of waters in the heavens; and he causeth thevapors to ascend from the ends of the earth: he maketh lightnings withrain, and bringeth forth the wind out of his treasures. 

{51:17} Everyman is brutish by [his] knowledge; every founder is confounded by thegraven image: for his molten image [is] falsehood, and [there is] nobreath in them. 

{51:18} They [are] vanity, the work of errors: in thetime of their visitation they shall perish. 

{51:19} The portion ofJacob [is] not like them; for he [is] the former of all things: and[Israel is] the rod of his inheritance: the LORD of hosts is his name.

{51:20} Thou [art] my battle axe [and] weapons of war: for with theewill I break in pieces the nations, and with thee will I destroykingdoms; 

{51:21} And with thee will I break in pieces the horse andhis rider; and with thee will I break in pieces the chariot and hisrider; 

{51:22} With thee also will I break in pieces man and woman; andwith thee will I break in pieces old and young; and with thee will Ibreak in pieces the young man and the maid; 

{51:23} I will also breakin pieces with thee the shepherd and his flock; and with thee will Ibreak in pieces the husbandman and his yoke of oxen; and with thee willI break in pieces captains and rulers. 

{51:24} And I will render untoBabylon and to all the inhabitants of Chaldea all their evil that theyhave done in Zion in your sight, saith the LORD. 

{51:25} Behold, I [am]against thee, O destroying mountain, saith the LORD, which destroyestall the earth: and I will stretch out mine hand upon thee, and rollthee down from the rocks, and will make thee a burnt mountain. 

{51:26}And they shall not take of thee a stone for a corner, nor a stone forfoundations; but thou shalt be desolate for ever, saith the LORD.

{51:27} Set ye up a standard in the land, blow the trumpet among thenations, prepare the nations against her, call together against her thekingdoms of Ararat, Minni, and Ashchenaz; appoint a captain againsther; cause the horses to come up as the rough caterpillers. 

{51:28}Prepare against her the nations with the kings of the Medes, thecaptains thereof, and all the rulers thereof, and all the land of hisdominion. 

{51:29} And the land shall tremble and sorrow: for everypurpose of the LORD shall be performed against Babylon, to make theland of Babylon a desolation without an inhabitant. 

{51:30} The mightymen of Babylon have forborn to fight, they have remained in [their]holds: their might hath failed; they became as women: they have burnedher dwellingplaces; her bars are broken. 

{51:31} One post shall run tomeet another, and one messenger to meet another, to shew the king ofBabylon that his city is taken at [one] end, 

{51:32} And that thepassages are stopped, and the reeds they have burned with fire, and themen of war are affrighted. 

{51:33} For thus saith the LORD of hosts,the God of Israel; The daughter of Babylon [is] like a threshingfloor,[it is] time to thresh her: yet a little while, and the time of herharvest shall come. 

{51:34} Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon hathdevoured me, he hath crushed me, he hath made me an empty vessel, hehath swallowed me up like a dragon, he hath filled his belly with mydelicates, he hath cast me out. 

{51:35} The violence done to me and tomy flesh [be] upon Babylon, shall the inhabitant of Zion say; and myblood upon the inhabitants of Chaldea, shall Jerusalem say. 

{51:36}Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will plead thy cause, and takevengeance for thee; and I will dry up her sea, and make her springsdry. 

{51:37} And Babylon shall become heaps, a dwelling place fordragons, an astonishment, and an hissing, without an inhabitant.

{51:38} They shall roar together like lions: they shall yell as lions'whelps. 

{51:39} In their heat I will make their feasts, and I will makethem drunken, that they may rejoice, and sleep a perpetual sleep, andnot wake, saith the LORD. 

{51:40} I will bring them down like lambs tothe slaughter, like rams with he goats. 

{51:41} How is Sheshach taken!and how is the praise of the whole earth surprised! how is Babylonbecome an astonishment among the nations! 

{51:42} The sea is come upupon Babylon: she is covered with the multitude of the waves thereof.

{51:43} Her cities are a desolation, a dry land, and a wilderness, aland wherein no man dwelleth, neither doth [any] son of man passthereby. 

{51:44} And I will punish Bel in Babylon, and I will bringforth out of his mouth that which he hath swallowed up: and the nationsshall not flow together any more unto him: yea, the wall of Babylonshall fall. 

{51:45} My people, go ye out of the midst of her, anddeliver ye every man his soul from the fierce anger of the LORD.

{51:46} And lest your heart faint, and ye fear for the rumour thatshall be heard in the land; a rumour shall both come [one] year, andafter that in [another] year [shall come] a rumour, and violence in theland, ruler against ruler. 

{51:47} Therefore, behold, the days come,that I will do judgment upon the graven images of Babylon: and herwhole land shall be confounded, and all her slain shall fall in themidst of her. 

{51:48} Then the heaven and the earth, and all that [is]therein, shall sing for Babylon: for the spoilers shall come unto herfrom the north, saith the LORD. 

{51:49} As Babylon [hath caused] theslain of Israel to fall, so at Babylon shall fall the slain of all theearth. 

{51:50} Ye that have escaped the sword, go away, stand notstill: remember the LORD afar off, and let Jerusalem come into yourmind. 

{51:51} We are confounded, because we have heard reproach: shamehath covered our faces: for strangers are come into the sanctuaries ofthe LORD'S house. 

{51:52} Wherefore, behold, the days come, saith theLORD, that I will do judgment upon her graven images: and through allher land the wounded shall groan. 

{51:53} Though Babylon should mountup to heaven, and though she should fortify the height of her strength,[yet] from me shall spoilers come unto her, saith the LORD. 

{51:54} Asound of a cry [cometh] from Babylon, and great destruction from theland of the Chaldeans: 

{51:55} Because the LORD hath spoiled Babylon,and destroyed out of her the great voice; when her waves do roar likegreat waters, a noise of their voice is uttered: 

{51:56} Because thespoiler is come upon her, [even] upon Babylon, and her mighty men aretaken, every one of their bows is broken: for the LORD God ofrecompences shall surely requite. 

{51:57} And I will make drunk herprinces, and her wise [men,] her captains, and her rulers, and hermighty men: and they shall sleep a perpetual sleep, and not wake, saiththe King, whose name [is] the LORD of hosts. 

{51:58} Thus saith theLORD of hosts; The broad walls of Babylon shall be utterly broken, andher high gates shall be burned with fire; and the people shall labourin vain, and the folk in the fire, and they shall be weary.   

{51:59} The word which Jeremiah the prophet commanded Seraiah theson of Neriah, the son of Maaseiah, when he went with Zedekiah the kingof Judah into Babylon in the fourth year of his reign. And [this]Seraiah was a quiet prince. 

{51:60} So Jeremiah wrote in a book all theevil that should come upon Babylon, [even] all these words that arewritten against Babylon. 

{51:61} And Jeremiah said to Seraiah, Whenthou comest to Babylon, and shalt see, and shalt read all these words;

{51:62} Then shalt thou say, O LORD, thou hast spoken against thisplace, to cut it off, that none shall remain in it, neither man norbeast, but that it shall be desolate for ever. 

{51:63} And it shall be,when thou hast made an end of reading this book, [that] thou shalt binda stone to it, and cast it into the midst of Euphrates: 

{51:64} Andthou shalt say, Thus shall Babylon sink, and shall not rise from theevil that I will bring upon her: and they shall be weary. Thus far[are] the words of Jeremiah.   

{52:1} Zedekiah was one and twenty years old when he began to reign,and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name [was]Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah. 

{52:2} And he did [thatwhich was] evil in the eyes of the LORD, according to all thatJehoiakim had done. 

{52:3} For through the anger of the LORD it came topass in Jerusalem and Judah, till he had cast them out from hispresence, that Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.   

{52:4} And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in thetenth month, in the tenth day of the month, [that] Nebuchadrezzar kingof Babylon came, he and all his army, against Jerusalem, and pitchedagainst it, and built forts against it round about. 

{52:5} So the citywas besieged unto the eleventh year of king Zedekiah. 

{52:6} And in thefourth month, in the ninth [day] of the month, the famine was sore inthe city, so that there was no bread for the people of the land. 

{52:7}Then the city was broken up, and all the men of war fled, and wentforth out of the city by night by the way of the gate between the twowalls, which [was] by the king's garden; (now the Chaldeans [were] bythe city round about:) and they went by the way of the plain.   

{52:8} But the army of the Chaldeans pursued after the king, andovertook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho; and all his army wasscattered from him. 

{52:9} Then they took the king, and carried him upunto the king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath; where he gavejudgment upon him. 

{52:10} And the king of Babylon slew the sons ofZedekiah before his eyes: he slew also all the princes of Judah inRiblah. 

{52:11} Then he put out the eyes of Zedekiah; and the king ofBabylon bound him in chains, and carried him to Babylon, and put him inprison till the day of his death.   

{52:12} Now in the fifth month, in the tenth [day] of the month,which [was] the nineteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, cameNebuzar-adan, captain of the guard, [which] served the king of Babylon,into Jerusalem, 

{52:13} And burned the house of the LORD, and theking's house; and all the houses of Jerusalem, and all the houses ofthe great [men,] burned he with fire: 

{52:14} And all the army of theChaldeans, that [were] with the captain of the guard, brake down allthe walls of Jerusalem round about. 

{52:15} Then Nebuzar-adan thecaptain of the guard carried away captive [certain] of the poor of thepeople, and the residue of the people that remained in the city, andthose that fell away, that fell to the king of Babylon, and the rest ofthe multitude. 

{52:16} But Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard left[certain] of the poor of the land for vinedressers and for husbandmen.

{52:17} Also the pillars of brass that [were] in the house of the LORD,and the bases, and the brasen sea that [was] in the house of the LORD,the Chaldeans brake, and carried all the brass of them to Babylon.

{52:18} The caldrons also, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and thebowls, and the spoons, and all the vessels of brass wherewith theyministered, took they away. 

{52:19} And the basons, and the firepans,and the bowls, and the caldrons, and the candlesticks, and the spoons,and the cups; [that] which [was] of gold [in] gold, and [that] which[was] of silver [in] silver, took the captain of the guard away.

{52:20} The two pillars, one sea, and twelve brasen bulls that [were]under the bases, which king Solomon had made in the house of the LORD:the brass of all these vessels was without weight. 

{52:21} And[concerning] the pillars, the height of one pillar [was] eighteencubits; and a fillet of twelve cubits did compass it; and the thicknessthereof [was] four fingers: [it was] hollow. 

{52:22} And a chapiter ofbrass [was] upon it; and the height of one chapiter [was] five cubits,with network and pomegranates upon the chapiters round about, all ofbrass. The second pillar also and the pomegranates [were] like untothese. 

{52:23} And there were ninety and six pomegranates on a side;[and] all the pomegranates upon the network [were] an hundred roundabout.   

{52:24} And the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest,and Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the door:

{52:25} He took also out of the city an eunuch, which had the charge ofthe men of war; and seven men of them that were near the king's person,which were found in the city; and the principal scribe of the host, whomustered the people of the land; and threescore men of the people ofthe land, that were found in the midst of the city. 

{52:26} SoNebuzar-adan the captain of the guard took them, and brought them tothe king of Babylon to Riblah. 

{52:27} And the king of Babylon smotethem, and put them to death in Riblah in the land of Hamath. Thus Judahwas carried away captive out of his own land. 

{52:28} This is thepeople whom Nebuchadrezzar carried away captive: in the seventh yearthree thousand Jews and three and twenty: 

{52:29} In the eighteenthyear of Nebuchadrezzar he carried away captive from Jerusalem eighthundred thirty and two persons: 

{52:30} In the three and twentieth yearof Nebuchadrezzar Nebuzar- adan the captain of the guard carried awaycaptive of the Jews seven hundred forty and five persons: all thepersons [were] four thousand and six hundred.   

{52:31} And it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of thecaptivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, in thefive and twentieth [day] of the month, [that] Evil-merodach king ofBabylon in the [first] year of his reign lifted up the head ofJehoiachin king of Judah, and brought him forth out of prison, 

{52:32}And spake kindly unto him, and set his throne above the throne of thekings that [were] with him in Babylon, 

{52:33} And changed his prisongarments: and he did continually eat bread before him all the days ofhis life. 

{52:34} And [for] his diet, there was a continual diet givenhim of the king of Babylon, every day a portion until the day of hisdeath, all the days of his life.
