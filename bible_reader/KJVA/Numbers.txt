{5:9} And every offering of all the holy things of thechildren of Israel, which they bring unto the priest, shall be his.

{5:10} And every man's hallowed things shall be his: whatsoever any mangiveth the priest, it shall be his.   

{5:11} And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 

{5:12} Speak unto thechildren of Israel, and say unto them, If any man's wife go aside, andcommit a trespass against him, 

{5:13} And a man lie with her carnally,and it be hid from the eyes of her husband, and be kept close, and shebe defiled, and [there be] no witness against her, neither she be taken[with the manner; ]

{5:14} And the spirit of jealousy come upon him, andhe be jealous of his wife, and she be defiled: or if the spirit ofjealousy come upon him, and he be jealous of his wife, and she be notdefiled: 

{5:15} Then shall the man bring his wife unto the priest, andhe shall bring her offering for her, the tenth [part] of an ephah ofbarley meal; he shall pour no oil upon it, nor put frankincensethereon; for it [is] an offering of jealousy, an offering of memorial,bringing iniquity to remembrance. 

{5:16} And the priest shall bring hernear, and set her before the LORD: 

{5:17} And the priest shall takeholy water in an earthen vessel; and of the dust that is in the floorof the tabernacle the priest shall take, and put [it] into the water:

{5:18} And the priest shall set the woman before the LORD, and uncoverthe woman's head, and put the offering of memorial in her hands, which[is] the jealousy offering: and the priest shall have in his hand thebitter water that causeth the curse: 

{5:19} And the priest shall chargeher by an oath, and say unto the woman, If no man have lain with thee,and if thou hast not gone aside to uncleanness [with another] insteadof thy husband, be thou free from this bitter water that causeth thecurse: 

{5:20} But if thou hast gone aside [to another] instead of thyhusband, and if thou be defiled, and some man have lain with theebeside thine husband: 

{5:21} Then the priest shall charge the womanwith an oath of cursing, and the priest shall say unto the woman, TheLORD make thee a curse and an oath among thy people, when the LORD dothmake thy thigh to rot, and thy belly to swell; 

{5:22} And this waterthat causeth the curse shall go into thy bowels, to make [thy] belly toswell, and [thy] thigh to rot: And the woman shall say, Amen, amen.

{5:23} And the priest shall write these curses in a book, and he shallblot [them] out with the bitter water: 

{5:24} And he shall cause thewoman to drink the bitter water that causeth the curse: and the waterthat causeth the curse shall enter into her, [and become] bitter.

{5:25} Then the priest shall take the jealousy offering out of thewoman's hand, and shall wave the offering before the LORD, and offer itupon the altar: 

{5:26} And the priest shall take an handful of theoffering, [even] the memorial thereof, and burn [it] upon the altar,and afterward shall cause the woman to drink the water. 

{5:27} And whenhe hath made her to drink the water, then it shall come to pass,[that,] if she be defiled, and have done trespass against her husband,that the water that causeth the curse shall enter into her, [andbecome] bitter, and her belly shall swell, and her thigh shall rot: andthe woman shall be a curse among her people. 

{5:28} And if the woman benot defiled, but be clean; then she shall be free, and shall conceiveseed. 

{5:29} This [is] the law of jealousies, when a wife goeth aside[to another] instead of her husband, and is defiled; 

{5:30} Or when thespirit of jealousy cometh upon him, and he be jealous over his wife,and shall set the woman before the LORD, and the priest shall executeupon her all this law. 

{5:31} Then shall the man be guiltless frominiquity, and this woman shall bear her iniquity.   

{6:1} And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 

{6:2} Speak unto thechildren of Israel, and say unto them, When either man or woman shallseparate [themselves] to vow a vow of a Nazarite, to separate[themselves] unto the LORD: 

{6:3} He shall separate [himself] from wineand strong drink, and shall drink no vinegar of wine, or vinegar ofstrong drink, neither shall he drink any liquor of grapes, nor eatmoist grapes, or dried. 

{6:4} All the days of his separation shall heeat nothing that is made of the vine tree, from the kernels even to thehusk. 

{6:5} All the days of the vow of his separation there shall norazor come upon his head: until the days be fulfilled, in the which heseparateth [himself] unto the LORD, he shall be holy, [and] shall letthe locks of the hair of his head grow. 

{6:6} All the days that heseparateth [himself] unto the LORD he shall come at no dead body. 

{6:7}He shall not make himself unclean for his father, or for his mother,for his brother, or for his sister, when they die: because theconsecration of his God [is] upon his head. 

{6:8} All the days of hisseparation he [is] holy unto the LORD. 

{6:9} And if any man die verysuddenly by him, and he hath defiled the head of his consecration; thenhe shall shave his head in the day of his cleansing, on the seventh dayshall he shave it. 

{6:10} And on the eighth day he shall bring twoturtles, or two young pigeons, to the priest, to the door of thetabernacle of the congregation: 

{6:11} And the priest shall offer theone for a sin offering, and the other for a burnt offering, and make anatonement for him, for that he sinned by the dead, and shall hallow hishead that same day. 

{6:12} And he shall consecrate unto the LORD thedays of his separation, and shall bring a lamb of the first year for atrespass offering: but the days that were before shall be lost, becausehis separation was defiled.   

{6:13} And this [is] the law of the Nazarite, when the days of hisseparation are fulfilled: he shall be brought unto the door of thetabernacle of the congregation: 

{6:14} And he shall offer his offeringunto the LORD, one he lamb of the first year without blemish for aburnt offering, and one ewe lamb of the first year without blemish fora sin offering, and one ram without blemish for peace offerings, 

{6:15}And a basket of unleavened bread, cakes of fine flour mingled with oil,and wafers of unleavened bread anointed with oil, and their meatoffering, and their drink offerings. 

{6:16} And the priest shall bring[them] before the LORD, and shall offer his sin offering, and his burntoffering: 

{6:17} And he shall offer the ram [for] a sacrifice of peaceofferings unto the LORD, with the basket of unleavened bread: thepriest shall offer also his meat offering, and his drink offering.

{6:18} And the Nazarite shall shave the head of his separation [at] thedoor of the tabernacle of the congregation, and shall take the hair ofthe head of his separation, and put [it] in the fire which [is] underthe sacrifice of the peace offerings. 

{6:19} And the priest shall takethe sodden shoulder of the ram, and one unleavened cake out of thebasket, and one unleavened wafer, and shall put [them] upon the handsof the Nazarite, after [the hair of] his separation is shaven: 

{6:20}And the priest shall wave them [for] a wave offering before the LORD:this [is] holy for the priest, with the wave breast and heave shoulder:and after that the Nazarite may drink wine. 

{6:21} This [is] the law ofthe Nazarite who hath vowed, [and of] his offering unto the LORD forhis separation, beside that [that] his hand shall get: according to thevow which he vowed, so he must do after the law of his separation.   

{6:22} And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 

{6:23} Speak untoAaron and unto his sons, saying, On this wise ye shall bless thechildren of Israel, saying unto them, 

{6:24} The LORD bless thee, andkeep thee: 

{6:25} The LORD make his face shine upon thee, and begracious unto thee: 

{6:26} The LORD lift up his countenance upon thee,and give thee peace. 

{6:27} And they shall put my name upon thechildren of Israel; and I will bless them.   

{7:1} And it came to pass on the day that Moses had fully set up thetabernacle, and had anointed it, and sanctified it, and all theinstruments thereof, both the altar and all the vessels thereof, andhad anointed them, and sanctified them; 

{7:2} That the princes ofIsrael, heads of the house of their fathers, who [were] the princes ofthe tribes, and were over them that were numbered, offered: 

{7:3} Andthey brought their offering before the LORD, six covered wagons, andtwelve oxen; a wagon for two of the princes, and for each one an ox:and they brought them before the tabernacle. 

{7:4} And the LORD spakeunto Moses, saying, 

{7:5} Take [it] of them, that they may be to do theservice of the tabernacle of the congregation; and thou shalt give themunto the Levites, to every man according to his service. 

{7:6} AndMoses took the wagons and the oxen, and gave them unto the Levites.

{7:7} Two wagons and four oxen he gave unto the sons of Gershon,according to their service: 

{7:8} And four wagons and eight oxen hegave unto the sons of Merari, according unto their service, under thehand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest. 

{7:9} But unto the sons ofKohath he gave none: because the service of the sanctuary belongingunto them [was that] they should bear upon their shoulders.   

{7:10} And the princes offered for dedicating of the altar in theday that it was anointed, even the princes offered their offeringbefore the altar. 

{7:11} And the LORD said unto Moses, They shall offertheir offering, each prince on his day, for the dedicating of the altar.

{7:89} And whenMoses was gone into the tabernacle of the congregation to speak withhim, then he heard the voice of one speaking unto him from off themercy seat that [was] upon the ark of testimony, from between the twocherubims: and he spake unto him.   

{8:1} And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 

{8:2} Speak unto Aaron,and say unto him, When thou lightest the lamps, the seven lamps shallgive light over against the candlestick. 

{8:3} And Aaron did so; helighted the lamps thereof over against the candlestick, as the LORDcommanded Moses. 

{8:4} And this work of the candlestick [was of] beatengold, unto the shaft thereof, unto the flowers thereof, [was] beatenwork: according unto the pattern which the LORD had shewed Moses, so hemade the candlestick.   

{8:5} And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 

{8:6} Take the Levitesfrom among the children of Israel, and cleanse them. 

{8:7} And thusshalt thou do unto them, to cleanse them: Sprinkle water of purifyingupon them, and let them shave all their flesh, and let them wash theirclothes, and [so] make themselves clean. 

{8:8} Then let them take ayoung bullock with his meat offering, [even] fine flour mingled withoil, and another young bullock shalt thou take for a sin offering.

{8:9} And thou shalt bring the Levites before the tabernacle of thecongregation: and thou shalt gather the whole assembly of the childrenof Israel together: 

{8:10} And thou shalt bring the Levites before theLORD: and the children of Israel shall put their hands upon theLevites: 

{8:11} And Aaron shall offer the Levites before the LORD [for]an offering of the children of Israel, that they may execute theservice of the LORD. 

{8:12} And the Levites shall lay their hands uponthe heads of the bullocks: and thou shalt offer the one [for] a sinoffering, and the other [for] a burnt offering, unto the LORD, to makean atonement for the Levites. 

{8:13} And thou shalt set the Levitesbefore Aaron, and before his sons, and offer them [for] an offeringunto the LORD. 

{8:14} Thus shalt thou separate the Levites from amongthe children of Israel: and the Levites shall be mine. 

{8:15} And afterthat shall the Levites go in to do the service of the tabernacle of thecongregation: and thou shalt cleanse them, and offer them [for] anoffering. 

{8:16} For they [are] wholly given unto me from among thechildren of Israel; instead of such as open every womb, [even insteadof] the firstborn of all the children of Israel, have I taken them untome. 

{8:17} For all the firstborn of the children of Israel [are] mine,[both] man and beast: on the day that I smote every firstborn in theland of Egypt I sanctified them for myself. 

{8:18} And I have taken theLevites for all the firstborn of the children of Israel. 

{8:19} And Ihave given the Levites [as] a gift to Aaron and to his sons from amongthe children of Israel, to do the service of the children of Israel inthe tabernacle of the congregation, and to make an atonement for thechildren of Israel: that there be no plague among the children ofIsrael, when the children of Israel come nigh unto the sanctuary.

{8:20} And Moses, and Aaron, and all the congregation of the childrenof Israel, did to the Levites according unto all that the LORDcommanded Moses concerning the Levites, so did the children of Israelunto them. 

{8:21} And the Levites were purified, and they washed theirclothes; and Aaron offered them [as] an offering before the LORD; andAaron made an atonement for them to cleanse them. 

{8:22} And after thatwent the Levites in to do their service in the tabernacle of thecongregation before Aaron, and before his sons: as the LORD hadcommanded Moses concerning the Levites, so did they unto them.   

{8:23} And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 

{8:24} This [is it]that [belongeth] unto the Levites: from twenty and five years old andupward they shall go in to wait upon the service of the tabernacle ofthe congregation: 

{8:25} And from the age of fifty years they shallcease waiting upon the service [thereof,] and shall serve no more:

{8:26} But shall minister with their brethren in the tabernacle of thecongregation, to keep the charge, and shall do no service. Thus shaltthou do unto the Levites touching their charge.   

{9:1} And the LORD spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, inthe first month of the second year after they were come out of the landof Egypt, saying, 

{9:2} Let the children of Israel also keep thepassover at his appointed season. 

{9:3} In the fourteenth day of thismonth, at even, ye shall keep it in his appointed season: according toall the rites of it, and according to all the ceremonies thereof, shallye keep it. 

{9:4} And Moses spake unto the children of Israel, thatthey should keep the passover. 

{9:5} And they kept the passover on thefourteenth day of the first month at even in the wilderness of Sinai:according to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so did the children ofIsrael.   

{9:6} And there were certain men, who were defiled by the dead bodyof a man, that they could not keep the passover on that day: and theycame before Moses and before Aaron on that day: 

{9:7} And those mensaid unto him, We [are] defiled by the dead body of a man: whereforeare we kept back, that we may not offer an offering of the LORD in hisappointed season among the children of Israel? 

{9:8} And Moses saidunto them, Stand still, and I will hear what the LORD will commandconcerning you.   

{9:9} And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 

{9:10} Speak unto thechildren of Israel, saying, If any man of you or of your posterityshall be unclean by reason of a dead body, or [be] in a journey afaroff, yet he shall keep the passover unto the LORD. 

{9:11} Thefourteenth day of the second month at even they shall keep it, [and]eat it with unleavened bread and bitter [herbs. ]

{9:12} They shallleave none of it unto the morning, nor break any bone of it: accordingto all the ordinances of the passover they shall keep it. 

{9:13} Butthe man that [is] clean, and is not in a journey, and forbeareth tokeep the passover, even the same soul shall be cut off from among hispeople: because he brought not the offering of the LORD in hisappointed season, that man shall bear his sin. 

{9:14} And if a strangershall sojourn among you, and will keep the passover unto the LORD;according to the ordinance of the passover, and according to the mannerthereof, so shall he do: ye shall have one ordinance, both for thestranger, and for him that was born in the land.   

{9:15} And on the day that the tabernacle was reared up the cloudcovered the tabernacle, [namely,] the tent of the testimony: and ateven there was upon the tabernacle as it were the appearance of fire,until the morning. 

{9:16} So it was alway: the cloud covered it [byday,] and the appearance of fire by night. 

{9:17} And when the cloudwas taken up from the tabernacle, then after that the children ofIsrael journeyed: and in the place where the cloud abode, there thechildren of Israel pitched their tents. 

{9:18} At the commandment ofthe LORD the children of Israel journeyed, and at the commandment ofthe LORD they pitched: as long as the cloud abode upon the tabernaclethey rested in their tents. 

{9:19} And when the cloud tarried long uponthe tabernacle many days, then the children of Israel kept the chargeof the LORD, and journeyed not. 

{9:20} And [so] it was, when the cloudwas a few days upon the tabernacle; according to the commandment of theLORD they abode in their tents, and according to the commandment of theLORD they journeyed. 

{9:21} And [so] it was, when the cloud abode fromeven unto the morning, and [that] the cloud was taken up in themorning, then they journeyed: whether [it was] by day or by night thatthe cloud was taken up, they journeyed. 

{9:22} Or [whether it were] twodays, or a month, or a year, that the cloud tarried upon thetabernacle, remaining thereon, the children of Israel abode in theirtents, and journeyed not: but when it was taken up, they journeyed.

{9:23} At the commandment of the LORD they rested in the tents, and atthe commandment of the LORD they journeyed: they kept the charge of theLORD, at the commandment of the LORD by the hand of Moses.   

{10:1} And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 

{10:2} Make thee twotrumpets of silver; of a whole piece shalt thou make them: that thoumayest use them for the calling of the assembly, and for the journeyingof the camps. 

{10:3} And when they shall blow with them, all theassembly shall assemble themselves to thee at the door of thetabernacle of the congregation. 

{10:4} And if they blow [but] with one[trumpet,] then the princes, [which are] heads of the thousands ofIsrael, shall gather themselves unto thee. 

{10:5} When ye blow analarm, then the camps that lie on the east parts shall go forward.

{10:6} When ye blow an alarm the second time, then the camps that lieon the south side shall take their journey: they shall blow an alarmfor their journeys. 

{10:7} But when the congregation is to be gatheredtogether, ye shall blow, but ye shall not sound an alarm. 

{10:8} Andthe sons of Aaron, the priests, shall blow with the trumpets; and theyshall be to you for an ordinance for ever throughout your generations.

{10:9} And if ye go to war in your land against the enemy thatoppresseth you, then ye shall blow an alarm with the trumpets; and yeshall be remembered before the LORD your God, and ye shall be savedfrom your enemies. 

{10:10} Also in the day of your gladness, and inyour solemn days, and in the beginnings of your months, ye shall blowwith the trumpets over your burnt offerings, and over the sacrifices ofyour peace offerings; that they may be to you for a memorial beforeyour God: I [am] the LORD your God.   

{10:11} And it came to pass on the twentieth [day] of the secondmonth, in the second year, that the cloud was taken up from off thetabernacle of the testimony. 

{10:12} And the children of Israel tooktheir journeys out of the wilderness of Sinai; and the cloud rested inthe wilderness of Paran. 

{10:13} And they first took their journeyaccording to the commandment of the LORD by the hand of Moses.   

{10:14} In the first [place] went the standard of the camp of thechildren of Judah according to their armies: and over his host [was]Nahshon the son of Amminadab. 

{10:15} And over the host of the tribe ofthe children of Issachar [was] Nethaneel the son of Zuar. 

{10:16} Andover the host of the tribe of the children of Zebulun [was] Eliab theson of Helon. 

{10:17} And the tabernacle was taken down; and the sonsof Gershon and the sons of Merari set forward, bearing the tabernacle.   

{10:18} And the standard of the camp of Reuben set forward accordingto their armies: and over his host [was] Elizur the son of Shedeur.

{10:19} And over the host of the tribe of the children of Simeon wasShelumiel the son of Zurishaddai. 

{10:20} And over the host of thetribe of the children of Gad was Eliasaph the son of Deuel. 

{10:21} Andthe Kohathites set forward, bearing the sanctuary: and [the other] didset up the tabernacle against they came.   

{10:22} And the standard of the camp of the children of Ephraim setforward according to their armies: and over his host [was] Elishama theson of Ammihud. 

{10:23} And over the host of the tribe of the childrenof Manasseh [was] Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur. 

{10:24} And over thehost of the tribe of the children of Benjamin [was] Abidan the son ofGideoni.   

{10:25} And the standard of the camp of the children of Dan setforward, [which was] the rereward of all the camps throughout theirhosts: and over his host [was] Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai. 

{10:26}And over the host of the tribe of the children of Asher [was] Pagielthe son of Ocran. 

{10:27} And over the host of the tribe of thechildren of Naphtali [was] Ahira the son of Enan. 

{10:28} Thus [were]the journeyings of the children of Israel according to their armies,when they set forward.   

{10:29} And Moses said unto Hobab, the son of Raguel the Midianite,Moses' father in law, We are journeying unto the place of which theLORD said, I will give it you: come thou with us, and we will do theegood: for the LORD hath spoken good concerning Israel. 

{10:30} And hesaid unto him, I will not go; but I will depart to mine own land, andto my kindred. 

{10:31} And he said, Leave us not, I pray thee;forasmuch as thou knowest how we are to encamp in the wilderness, andthou mayest be to us instead of eyes. 

{10:32} And it shall be, if thougo with us, yea, it shall be, that what goodness the LORD shall do untous, the same will we do unto thee.   

{10:33} And they departed from the mount of the LORD three days'journey: and the ark of the covenant of the LORD went before them inthe three days' journey, to search out a resting place for them.

{10:34} And the cloud of the LORD [was] upon them by day, when theywent out of the camp. 

{10:35} And it came to pass, when the ark setforward, that Moses said, Rise up, LORD, and let thine enemies bescattered; and let them that hate thee flee before thee. 

{10:36} Andwhen it rested, he said, Return, O LORD, unto the many thousands ofIsrael.   

{11:1} And [when] the people complained, it displeased the LORD: andthe LORD heard [it;] and his anger was kindled; and the fire of theLORD burnt among them, and consumed [them that were] in the uttermostparts of the camp. 

{11:2} And the people cried unto Moses; and whenMoses prayed unto the LORD, the fire was quenched. 

{11:3} And he calledthe name of the place Taberah: because the fire of the LORD burnt amongthem.   

{11:4} And the mixt multitude that [was] among them fell a lusting:and the children of Israel also wept again, and said, Who shall give usflesh to eat? 

{11:5} We remember the fish, which we did eat in Egyptfreely; the cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions,and the garlick: 

{11:6} But now our soul [is] dried away: [there is]nothing at all, beside this manna, [before] our eyes. 

{11:7} And themanna [was] as coriander seed, and the colour thereof as the colour ofbdellium. 

{11:8} [And] the people went about, and gathered [it,] andground [it] in mills, or beat [it] in a mortar, and baked [it] in pans,and made cakes of it: and the taste of it was as the taste of freshoil. 

{11:9} And when the dew fell upon the camp in the night, the mannafell upon it.   

{11:10} Then Moses heard the people weep throughout their families,every man in the door of his tent: and the anger of the LORD waskindled greatly; Moses also was displeased. 

{11:11} And Moses said untothe LORD, Wherefore hast thou afflicted thy servant? and wherefore haveI not found favour in thy sight, that thou layest the burden of allthis people upon me? 

{11:12} Have I conceived all this people? have Ibegotten them, that thou shouldest say unto me, Carry them in thybosom, as a nursing father beareth the sucking child, unto the landwhich thou swarest unto their fathers? 

{11:13} Whence should I haveflesh to give unto all this people? for they weep unto me, saying, Giveus flesh, that we may eat. 

{11:14} I am not able to bear all thispeople alone, because [it is] too heavy for me. 

{11:15} And if thoudeal thus with me, kill me, I pray thee, out of hand, if I have foundfavour in thy sight; and let me not see my wretchedness.   

{11:16} And the LORD said unto Moses, Gather unto me seventy men ofthe elders of Israel, whom thou knowest to be the elders of the people,and officers over them; and bring them unto the tabernacle of thecongregation, that they may stand there with thee. 

{11:17} And I willcome down and talk with thee there: and I will take of the spirit which[is] upon thee, and will put [it] upon them; and they shall bear theburden of the people with thee, that thou bear it not thyself alone.

{11:18} And say thou unto the people, Sanctify yourselves against tomorrow, and ye shall eat flesh: for ye have wept in the ears of theLORD, saying, Who shall give us flesh to eat? for [it was] well with usin Egypt: therefore the LORD will give you flesh, and ye shall eat.

{11:19} Ye shall not eat one day, nor two days, nor five days, neitherten days, nor twenty days; 

{11:20} [But] even a whole month, until itcome out at your nostrils, and it be loathsome unto you: because thatye have despised the LORD which [is] among you, and have wept beforehim, saying, Why came we forth out of Egypt? 

{11:21} And Moses said,The people, among whom I [am, are] six hundred thousand footmen; andthou hast said, I will give them flesh, that they may eat a wholemonth. 

{11:22} Shall the flocks and the herds be slain for them, tosuffice them? or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together forthem, to suffice them? 

{11:23} And the LORD said unto Moses, Is theLORD'S hand waxed short? thou shalt see now whether my word shall cometo pass unto thee or not.   

{11:24} And Moses went out, and told the people the words of theLORD, and gathered the seventy men of the elders of the people, and setthem round about the tabernacle. 

{11:25} And the LORD came down in acloud, and spake unto him, and took of the spirit that [was] upon him,and gave [it] unto the seventy elders: and it came to pass, [that,]when the spirit rested upon them, they prophesied, and did not cease.

{11:26} But there remained two [of the] men in the camp, the name ofthe one [was] Eldad, and the name of the other Medad: and the spiritrested upon them; and they [were] of them that were written, but wentnot out unto the tabernacle: and they prophesied in the camp. 

{11:27}And there ran a young man, and told Moses, and said, Eldad and Medad doprophesy in the camp. 

{11:28} And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant ofMoses, [one] of his young men, answered and said, My lord Moses, forbidthem. 

{11:29} And Moses said unto him, Enviest thou for my sake? wouldGod that all the LORD'S people were prophets, [and] that the LORD wouldput his spirit upon them! 

{11:30} And Moses gat him into the camp, heand the elders of Israel.   

{11:31} And there went forth a wind from the LORD, and broughtquails from the sea, and let [them] fall by the camp, as it were aday's journey on this side, and as it were a day's journey on the otherside, round about the camp, and as it were two cubits [high] upon theface of the earth. 

{11:32} And the people stood up all that day, andall [that] night, and all the next day, and they gathered the quails:he that gathered least gathered ten homers: and they spread [them] allabroad for themselves round about the camp. 

{11:33} And while the flesh[was] yet between their teeth, ere it was chewed, the wrath of the LORDwas kindled against the people, and the LORD smote the people with avery great plague. 

{11:34} And he called the name of that placeKibroth-hattaavah: because there they buried the people that lusted.

{11:35} [And] the people journeyed from Kibroth- hattaavah untoHazeroth; and abode at Hazeroth.   

{12:1} And Miriam and Aaron spake against Moses because of theEthiopian woman whom he had married: for he had married an Ethiopianwoman. 

{12:2} And they said, Hath the LORD indeed spoken only by Moses?hath he not spoken also by us? And the LORD heard [it. ]

{12:3} (Now theman Moses [was] very meek, above all the men which [were] upon the faceof the earth.) 

{12:4} And the LORD spake suddenly unto Moses, and untoAaron, and unto Miriam, Come out ye three unto the tabernacle of thecongregation. And they three came out. 

{12:5} And the LORD came down inthe pillar of the cloud, and stood in the door of the tabernacle, andcalled Aaron and Miriam: and they both came forth. 

{12:6} And he said,Hear now my words: If there be a prophet among you, [I] the LORD willmake myself known unto him in a vision, [and] will speak unto him in adream. 

{12:7} My servant Moses [is] not so, who [is] faithful in allmine house. 

{12:8} With him will I speak mouth to mouth, evenapparently, and not in dark speeches; and the similitude of the LORDshall he behold: wherefore then were ye not afraid to speak against myservant Moses? 

{12:9} And the anger of the LORD was kindled againstthem; and he departed. 

{12:10} And the cloud departed from off thetabernacle; and, behold, Miriam [became] leprous, [white] as snow: andAaron looked upon Miriam, and, behold, [she was] leprous. 

{12:11} AndAaron said unto Moses, Alas, my lord, I beseech thee, lay not the sinupon us, wherein we have done foolishly, and wherein we have sinned.

{12:12} Let her not be as one dead, of whom the flesh is half consumedwhen he cometh out of his mother's womb. 

{12:13} And Moses cried untothe LORD, saying, Heal her now, O God, I beseech thee.   

{12:14} And the LORD said unto Moses, If her father had but spit inher face, should she not be ashamed seven days? let her be shut outfrom the camp seven days, and after that let her be received in [again.]

{12:15} And Miriam was shut out from the camp seven days: and thepeople journeyed not till Miriam was brought in [again. ]

{12:16} Andafterward the people removed from Hazeroth, and pitched in thewilderness of Paran.   

{13:1} And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 

{13:2} Send thou men,that they may search the land of Canaan, which I give unto the childrenof Israel: of every tribe of their fathers shall ye send a man, everyone a ruler among them. 

{13:3} And Moses by the commandment of the LORDsent them from the wilderness of Paran: all those men [were] heads ofthe children of Israel. 

{13:4} And these [were] their names: of thetribe of Reuben, Shammua the son of Zaccur. 

{13:5} Of the tribe ofSimeon, Shaphat the son of Hori. 

{13:6} Of the tribe of Judah, Calebthe son of Jephunneh. 

{13:7} Of the tribe of Issachar, Igal the son ofJoseph. 

{13:8} Of the tribe of Ephraim, Oshea the son of Nun. 

{13:9} Ofthe tribe of Benjamin, Palti the son of Raphu. 

{13:10} Of the tribe ofZebulun, Gaddiel the son of Sodi. 

{13:11} Of the tribe of Joseph,namely, of the tribe of Manasseh, Gaddi the son of Susi. 

{13:12} Of thetribe of Dan, Ammiel the son of Gemalli. 

{13:13} Of the tribe of Asher,Sethur the son of Michael. 

{13:14} Of the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi theson of Vophsi. 

{13:15} Of the tribe of Gad, Geuel the son of Machi.

{13:16} These [are] the names of the men which Moses sent to spy outthe land. And Moses called Oshea the son of Nun Jehoshua.   

{13:17} And Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan, and saidunto them, Get you up this [way] southward, and go up into themountain: 

{13:18} And see the land, what it [is;] and the people thatdwelleth therein, whether they [be] strong or weak, few or many;

{13:19} And what the land [is] that they dwell in, whether it [be] goodor bad; and what cities [they be] that they dwell in, whether in tents,or in strong holds; 

{13:20} And what the land [is,] whether it [be] fator lean, whether there be wood therein, or not. And be ye of goodcourage, and bring of the fruit of the land. Now the time [was] thetime of the firstripe grapes.   

{13:21} So they went up, and searched the land from the wildernessof Zin unto Rehob, as men come to Hamath. 

{13:22} And they ascended bythe south, and came unto Hebron; where Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, thechildren of Anak, [were.] (Now Hebron was built seven years before Zoanin Egypt.) 

{13:23} And they came unto the brook of Eshcol, and cut downfrom thence a branch with one cluster of grapes, and they bare itbetween two upon a staff; and [they brought] of the pomegranates, andof the figs. 

{13:24} The place was called the brook Eshcol, because ofthe cluster of grapes which the children of Israel cut down fromthence. 

{13:25} And they returned from searching of the land afterforty days.   

{13:26} And they went and came to Moses, and to Aaron, and to allthe congregation of the children of Israel, unto the wilderness ofParan, to Kadesh; and brought back word unto them, and unto all thecongregation, and shewed them the fruit of the land. 

{13:27} And theytold him, and said, We came unto the land whither thou sentest us, andsurely it floweth with milk and honey; and this [is] the fruit of it.

{13:28} Nevertheless the people [be] strong that dwell in the land, andthe cities [are] walled, [and] very great: and moreover we saw thechildren of Anak there. 

{13:29} The Amalekites dwell in the land of thesouth: and the Hittites, and the Jebusites, and the Amorites, dwell inthe mountains: and the Canaanites dwell by the sea, and by the coast ofJordan. 

{13:30} And Caleb stilled the people before Moses, and said,Let us go up at once, and possess it; for we are well able to overcomeit. 

{13:31} But the men that went up with him said, We be not able togo up against the people; for they are stronger than we. 

{13:32} Andthey brought up an evil report of the land which they had searched untothe children of Israel, saying, The land, through which we have gone tosearch it, is a land that eateth up the inhabitants thereof; and allthe people that we saw in it [are] men of a great stature. 

{13:33} Andthere we saw the giants, the sons of Anak, [which come] of the giants:and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers, and so we were in theirsight.   

{14:1} And all the congregation lifted up their voice, and cried;and the people wept that night. 

{14:2} And all the children of Israelmurmured against Moses and against Aaron: and the whole congregationsaid unto them, Would God that we had died in the land of Egypt! orwould God we had died in this wilderness! 

{14:3} And wherefore hath theLORD brought us unto this land, to fall by the sword, that our wivesand our children should be a prey? were it not better for us to returninto Egypt? 

{14:4} And they said one to another, Let us make a captain,and let us return into Egypt. 

{14:5} Then Moses and Aaron fell on theirfaces before all the assembly of the congregation of the children ofIsrael.   

{14:6} And Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh,[which were] of them that searched the land, rent their clothes: 

{14:7}And they spake unto all the company of the children of Israel, saying,The land, which we passed through to search it, [is] an exceeding goodland. 

{14:8} If the LORD delight in us, then he will bring us into thisland, and give it us; a land which floweth with milk and honey. 

{14:9}Only rebel not ye against the LORD, neither fear ye the people of theland; for they [are] bread for us: their defence is departed from them,and the LORD [is] with us: fear them not. 

{14:10} But all thecongregation bade stone them with stones. And the glory of the LORDappeared in the tabernacle of the congregation before all the childrenof Israel.   

{14:11} And the LORD said unto Moses, How long will this peopleprovoke me? and how long will it be ere they believe me, for all thesigns which I have shewed among them? 

{14:12} I will smite them withthe pestilence, and disinherit them, and will make of thee a greaternation and mightier than they.   

{14:13} And Moses said unto the LORD, Then the Egyptians shall hear[it,] (for thou broughtest up this people in thy might from amongthem;) 

{14:14} And they will tell [it] to the inhabitants of this land:[for] they have heard that thou LORD [art] among this people, that thouLORD art seen face to face, and [that] thy cloud standeth over them,and [that] thou goest before them, by daytime in a pillar of a cloud,and in a pillar of fire by night.   

{14:15} Now [if] thou shalt kill [all] this people as one man, thenthe nations which have heard the fame of thee will speak, saying,

{14:16} Because the LORD was not able to bring this people into theland which he sware unto them, therefore he hath slain them in thewilderness. 

{14:17} And now, I beseech thee, let the power of my Lordbe great, according as thou hast spoken, saying, 

{14:18} The LORD [is]longsuffering, and of great mercy, forgiving iniquity andtransgression, and by no means clearing [the guilty,] visiting theiniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth[generation. ]

{14:19} Pardon, I beseech thee, the iniquity of thispeople according unto the greatness of thy mercy, and as thou hastforgiven this people, from Egypt even until now. 

{14:20} And the LORDsaid, I have pardoned according to thy word: 

{14:21} But [as] truly[as] I live, all the earth shall be filled with the glory of the LORD.

{14:22} Because all those men which have seen my glory, and mymiracles, which I did in Egypt and in the wilderness, and have temptedme now these ten times, and have not hearkened to my voice; 

{14:23}Surely they shall not see the land which I sware unto their fathers,neither shall any of them that provoked me see it: 

{14:24} But myservant Caleb, because he had another spirit with him, and hathfollowed me fully, him will I bring into the land whereinto he went;and his seed shall possess it. 

{14:25} (Now the Amalekites and theCanaanites dwelt in the valley.) To morrow turn you, and get you intothe wilderness by the way of the Red sea.   

{14:26} And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,

{14:27} How long [shall I bear with] this evil congregation, whichmurmur against me? I have heard the murmurings of the children ofIsrael, which they murmur against me. 

{14:28} Say unto them, [As trulyas] I live, saith the LORD, as ye have spoken in mine ears, so will Ido to you: 

{14:29} Your carcases shall fall in this wilderness; and allthat were numbered of you, according to your whole number, from twentyyears old and upward, which have murmured against me, 

{14:30} Doubtlessye shall not come into the land, [concerning] which I sware to make youdwell therein, save Caleb the son of Jephunneh, and Joshua the son ofNun. 

{14:31} But your little ones, which ye said should be a prey, themwill I bring in, and they shall know the land which ye have despised.

{14:32} But [as for] you, your carcases, they shall fall in thiswilderness. 

{14:33} And your children shall wander in the wildernessforty years, and bear your whoredoms, until your carcases be wasted inthe wilderness. 

{14:34} After the number of the days in which yesearched the land, [even] forty days, each day for a year, shall yebear your iniquities, [even] forty years, and ye shall know my breachof promise. 

{14:35} I the LORD have said, I will surely do it unto allthis evil congregation, that are gathered together against me: in thiswilderness they shall be consumed, and there they shall die. 

{14:36}And the men, which Moses sent to search the land, who returned, andmade all the congregation to murmur against him, by bringing up aslander upon the land, 

{14:37} Even those men that did bring up theevil report upon the land, died by the plague before the LORD. 

{14:38}But Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, [which were]of the men that went to search the land, lived [still. ]

{14:39} AndMoses told these sayings unto all the children of Israel: and thepeople mourned greatly.   

{14:40} And they rose up early in the morning, and gat them up intothe top of the mountain, saying, Lo, we [be here,] and will go up untothe place which the LORD hath promised: for we have sinned. 

{14:41} AndMoses said, Wherefore now do ye transgress the commandment of the LORD?but it shall not prosper. 

{14:42} Go not up, for the LORD [is] notamong you; that ye be not smitten before your enemies. 

{14:43} For theAmalekites and the Canaanites [are] there before you, and ye shall fallby the sword: because ye are turned away from the LORD, therefore theLORD will not be with you. 

{14:44} But they presumed to go up unto thehill top: nevertheless the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and Moses,departed not out of the camp. 

{14:45} Then the Amalekites came down,and the Canaanites which dwelt in that hill, and smote them, anddiscomfited them, [even] unto Hormah.   

{15:1} And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 

{15:2} Speak unto thechildren of Israel, and say unto them, When ye be come into the land ofyour habitations, which I give unto you, 

{15:3} And will make anoffering by fire unto the LORD, a burnt offering, or a sacrifice inperforming a vow, or in a freewill offering, or in your solemn feasts,to make a sweet savour unto the LORD, of the herd, or of the flock:

{15:4} Then shall he that offereth his offering unto the LORD bring ameat offering of a tenth deal of flour mingled with the fourth [part]of an hin of oil. 

{15:5} And the fourth [part] of an hin of wine for adrink offering shalt thou prepare with the burnt offering or sacrifice,for one lamb. 

{15:6} Or for a ram, thou shalt prepare [for] a meatoffering two tenth deals of flour mingled with the third [part] of anhin of oil. 

{15:7} And for a drink offering thou shalt offer the third[part] of an hin of wine, [for] a sweet savour unto the LORD. 

{15:8}And when thou preparest a bullock [for] a burnt offering, or [for] asacrifice in performing a vow, or peace offerings unto the LORD: 

{15:9}Then shall he bring with a bullock a meat offering of three tenth dealsof flour mingled with half an hin of oil. 

{15:10} And thou shalt bringfor a drink offering half an hin of wine, for an offering made by fire,of a sweet savour unto the LORD. 

{15:11} Thus shall it be done for onebullock, or for one ram, or for a lamb, or a kid. 

{15:12} According tothe number that ye shall prepare, so shall ye do to every one accordingto their number. 

{15:13} All that are born of the country shall dothese things after this manner, in offering an offering made by fire,of a sweet savour unto the LORD. 

{15:14} And if a stranger sojourn withyou, or whosoever [be] among you in your generations, and will offer anoffering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD; as ye do, so heshall do. 

{15:15} One ordinance [shall be both] for you of thecongregation, and also for the stranger that sojourneth [with you,] anordinance for ever in your generations: as ye [are,] so shall thestranger be before the LORD. 

{15:16} One law and one manner shall befor you, and for the stranger that sojourneth with you.   

{15:17} And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 

{15:18} Speak untothe children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye come into the landwhither I bring you, 

{15:19} Then it shall be, that, when ye eat of thebread of the land, ye shall offer up an heave offering unto the LORD.

{15:20} Ye shall offer up a cake of the first of your dough [for] anheave offering: as [ye do] the heave offering of the threshingfloor, soshall ye heave it. 

{15:21} Of the first of your dough ye shall giveunto the LORD an heave offering in your generations.   

{15:22} And if ye have erred, and not observed all thesecommandments, which the LORD hath spoken unto Moses, 

{15:23} [Even all]that the LORD hath commanded you by the hand of Moses, from the daythat the LORD commanded [Moses,] and henceforward among yourgenerations; 

{15:24} Then it shall be, if [ought] be committed byignorance without the knowledge of the congregation, that all thecongregation shall offer one young bullock for a burnt offering, for asweet savour unto the LORD, with his meat offering, and his drinkoffering, according to the manner, and one kid of the goats for a sinoffering. 

{15:25} And the priest shall make an atonement for all thecongregation of the children of Israel, and it shall be forgiven them;for it is ignorance: and they shall bring their offering, a sacrificemade by fire unto the LORD, and their sin offering before the LORD, fortheir ignorance: 

{15:26} And it shall be forgiven all the congregationof the children of Israel, and the stranger that sojourneth among them;seeing all the people [were] in ignorance.   

{15:27} And if any soul sin through ignorance, then he shall bring ashe goat of the first year for a sin offering. 

{15:28} And the priestshall make an atonement for the soul that sinneth ignorantly, when hesinneth by ignorance before the LORD, to make an atonement for him; andit shall be forgiven him. 

{15:29} Ye shall have one law for him thatsinneth through ignorance, [both for] him that is born among thechildren of Israel, and for the stranger that sojourneth among them.   

{15:30} But the soul that doeth [ought] presumptuously, [whether hebe] born in the land, or a stranger, the same reproacheth the LORD; andthat soul shall be cut off from among his people. 

{15:31} Because hehath despised the word of the LORD, and hath broken his commandment,that soul shall utterly be cut off; his iniquity [shall be] upon him.   

{15:32} And while the children of Israel were in the wilderness,they found a man that gathered sticks upon the sabbath day. 

{15:33} Andthey that found him gathering sticks brought him unto Moses and Aaron,and unto all the congregation. 

{15:34} And they put him in ward,because it was not declared what should be done to him. 

{15:35} And theLORD said unto Moses, The man shall be surely put to death: all thecongregation shall stone him with stones without the camp. 

{15:36} Andall the congregation brought him without the camp, and stoned him withstones, and he died; as the LORD commanded Moses.   

{15:37} And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 

{15:38} Speak untothe children of Israel, and bid them that they make them fringes in theborders of their garments throughout their generations, and that theyput upon the fringe of the borders a ribband of blue: 

{15:39} And itshall be unto you for a fringe, that ye may look upon it, and rememberall the commandments of the LORD, and do them; and that ye seek notafter your own heart and your own eyes, after which ye use to go awhoring: 

{15:40} That ye may remember, and do all my commandments, andbe holy unto your God. 

{15:41} I [am] the LORD your God, which broughtyou out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: I [am] the LORD your God.   

{16:1} Now Korah, the son of Izhar, the son of Kohath, the son ofLevi, and Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, and On, the son ofPeleth, sons of Reuben, took [men: ]

{16:2} And they rose up beforeMoses, with certain of the children of Israel, two hundred and fiftyprinces of the assembly, famous in the congregation, men of renown:

{16:3} And they gathered themselves together against Moses and againstAaron, and said unto them, [Ye take] too much upon you, seeing all thecongregation [are] holy, every one of them, and the LORD [is] amongthem: wherefore then lift ye up yourselves above the congregation ofthe LORD? 

{16:4} And when Moses heard [it,] he fell upon his face:

{16:5} And he spake unto Korah and unto all his company, saying, Evento morrow the LORD will shew who [are] his, and [who is] holy; and willcause [him] to come near unto him: even [him] whom he hath chosen willhe cause to come near unto him. 

{16:6} This do; Take you censers,Korah, and all his company; 

{16:7} And put fire therein, and putincense in them before the LORD to morrow: and it shall be [that] theman whom the LORD doth choose, he [shall be] holy: [ye take] too muchupon you, ye sons of Levi. 

{16:8} And Moses said unto Korah, Hear, Ipray you, ye sons of Levi: 

{16:9} [Seemeth it but] a small thing untoyou, that the God of Israel hath separated you from the congregation ofIsrael, to bring you near to himself to do the service of thetabernacle of the LORD, and to stand before the congregation tominister unto them? 

{16:10} And he hath brought thee near [to him,] andall thy brethren the sons of Levi with thee: and seek ye the priesthoodalso? 

{16:11} For which cause [both] thou and all thy company [are]gathered together against the LORD: and what [is] Aaron, that ye murmuragainst him?   

{16:12} And Moses sent to call Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab:which said, We will not come up: 

{16:13} [Is it] a small thing thatthou hast brought us up out of a land that floweth with milk and honey,to kill us in the wilderness, except thou make thyself altogether aprince over us? 

{16:14} Moreover thou hast not brought us into a landthat floweth with milk and honey, or given us inheritance of fields andvineyards: wilt thou put out the eyes of these men? we will not comeup. 

{16:15} And Moses was very wroth, and said unto the LORD, Respectnot thou their offering: I have not taken one ass from them, neitherhave I hurt one of them. 

{16:16} And Moses said unto Korah, Be thou andall thy company before the LORD, thou, and they, and Aaron, to morrow:

{16:17} And take every man his censer, and put incense in them, andbring ye before the LORD every man his censer, two hundred and fiftycensers; thou also, and Aaron, each [of you] his censer. 

{16:18} Andthey took every man his censer, and put fire in them, and laid incensethereon, and stood in the door of the tabernacle of the congregationwith Moses and Aaron. 

{16:19} And Korah gathered all the congregationagainst them unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: andthe glory of the LORD appeared unto all the congregation. 

{16:20} Andthe LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying, 

{16:21} Separateyourselves from among this congregation, that I may consume them in amoment. 

{16:22} And they fell upon their faces, and said, O God, theGod of the spirits of all flesh, shall one man sin, and wilt thou bewroth with all the congregation?   

{16:23} And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 

{16:24} Speak untothe congregation, saying, Get you up from about the tabernacle ofKorah, Dathan, and Abiram. 

{16:25} And Moses rose up and went untoDathan and Abiram; and the elders of Israel followed him. 

{16:26} Andhe spake unto the congregation, saying, Depart, I pray you, from thetents of these wicked men, and touch nothing of theirs, lest ye beconsumed in all their sins. 

{16:27} So they gat up from the tabernacleof Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, on every side: and Dathan and Abiram cameout, and stood in the door of their tents, and their wives, and theirsons, and their little children. 

{16:28} And Moses said, Hereby yeshall know that the LORD hath sent me to do all these works; for [Ihave] not [done them] of mine own mind. 

{16:29} If these men die thecommon death of all men, or if they be visited after the visitation ofall men; [then] the LORD hath not sent me. 

{16:30} But if the LORD makea new thing, and the earth open her mouth, and swallow them up, withall that [appertain] unto them, and they go down quick into the pit;then ye shall understand that these men have provoked the LORD.   

{16:31} And it came to pass, as he had made an end of speaking allthese words, that the ground clave asunder that [was] under them:

{16:32} And the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up, andtheir houses, and all the men that [appertained] unto Korah, and all[their] goods. 

{16:33} They, and all that [appertained] to them, wentdown alive into the pit, and the earth closed upon them: and theyperished from among the congregation. 

{16:34} And all Israel that[were] round about them fled at the cry of them: for they said, Lestthe earth swallow us up [also. ]

{16:35} And there came out a fire fromthe LORD, and consumed the two hundred and fifty men that offeredincense.   

{16:36} And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 

{16:37} Speak untoEleazar the son of Aaron the priest, that he take up the censers out ofthe burning, and scatter thou the fire yonder; for they are hallowed.

{16:38} The censers of these sinners against their own souls, let themmake them broad plates [for] a covering of the altar: for they offeredthem before the LORD, therefore they are hallowed: and they shall be asign unto the children of Israel. 

{16:39} And Eleazar the priest tookthe brasen censers, wherewith they that were burnt had offered; andthey were made broad [plates for] a covering of the altar: 

{16:40} [Tobe] a memorial unto the children of Israel, that no stranger, which isnot of the seed of Aaron, come near to offer incense before the LORD;that he be not as Korah, and as his company: as the LORD said to him bythe hand of Moses.   

{16:41} But on the morrow all the congregation of the children ofIsrael murmured against Moses and against Aaron, saying, Ye have killedthe people of the LORD. 

{16:42} And it came to pass, when thecongregation was gathered against Moses and against Aaron, that theylooked toward the tabernacle of the congregation: and, behold, thecloud covered it, and the glory of the LORD appeared. 

{16:43} And Mosesand Aaron came before the tabernacle of the congregation.   

{16:44} And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 

{16:45} Get you upfrom among this congregation, that I may consume them as in a moment.And they fell upon their faces.   

{16:46} And Moses said unto Aaron, Take a censer, and put firetherein from off the altar, and put on incense, and go quickly unto thecongregation, and make an atonement for them: for there is wrath goneout from the LORD; the plague is begun. 

{16:47} And Aaron took as Mosescommanded, and ran into the midst of the congregation; and, behold, theplague was begun among the people: and he put on incense, and made anatonement for the people. 

{16:48} And he stood between the dead and theliving; and the plague was stayed. 

{16:49} Now they that died in theplague were fourteen thousand and seven hundred, beside them that diedabout the matter of Korah. 

{16:50} And Aaron returned unto Moses untothe door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and the plague wasstayed.   

{17:1} And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 

{17:2} Speak unto thechildren of Israel, and take of every one of them a rod according tothe house of [their] fathers, of all their princes according to thehouse of their fathers twelve rods: write thou every man's name uponhis rod. 

{17:3} And thou shalt write Aaron's name upon the rod of Levi:for one rod [shall be] for the head of the house of their fathers.

{17:4} And thou shalt lay them up in the tabernacle of the congregationbefore the testimony, where I will meet with you. 

{17:5} And it shallcome to pass, [that] the man's rod, whom I shall choose, shall blossom:and I will make to cease from me the murmurings of the children ofIsrael, whereby they murmur against you.   

{17:6} And Moses spake unto the children of Israel, and every one oftheir princes gave him a rod apiece, for each prince one, according totheir fathers' houses, [even] twelve rods: and the rod of Aaron [was]among their rods. 

{17:7} And Moses laid up the rods before the LORD inthe tabernacle of witness. 

{17:8} And it came to pass, that on themorrow Moses went into the tabernacle of witness; and, behold, the rodof Aaron for the house of Levi was budded, and brought forth buds, andbloomed blossoms, and yielded almonds. 

{17:9} And Moses brought out allthe rods from before the LORD unto all the children of Israel: and theylooked, and took every man his rod.   

{17:10} And the LORD said unto Moses, Bring Aaron's rod again beforethe testimony, to be kept for a token against the rebels; and thoushalt quite take away their murmurings from me, that they die not.

{17:11} And Moses did [so:] as the LORD commanded him, so did he.

{17:12} And the children of Israel spake unto Moses, saying, Behold, wedie, we perish, we all perish. 

{17:13} Whosoever cometh any thing nearunto the tabernacle of the LORD shall die: shall we be consumed withdying?   

{18:1} And the LORD said unto Aaron, Thou and thy sons and thyfather's house with thee shall bear the iniquity of the sanctuary: andthou and thy sons with thee shall bear the iniquity of your priesthood.

{18:2} And thy brethren also of the tribe of Levi, the tribe of thyfather, bring thou with thee, that they may be joined unto thee, andminister unto thee: but thou and thy sons with thee [shall minister]before the tabernacle of witness. 

{18:3} And they shall keep thycharge, and the charge of all the tabernacle: only they shall not comenigh the vessels of the sanctuary and the altar, that neither they, norye also, die. 

{18:4} And they shall be joined unto thee, and keep thecharge of the tabernacle of the congregation, for all the service ofthe tabernacle: and a stranger shall not come nigh unto you. 

{18:5} Andye shall keep the charge of the sanctuary, and the charge of the altar:that there be no wrath any more upon the children of Israel. 

{18:6} AndI, behold, I have taken your brethren the Levites from among thechildren of Israel: to you [they are] given [as] a gift for the LORD,to do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation. 

{18:7}Therefore thou and thy sons with thee shall keep your priest's officefor every thing of the altar, and within the vail; and ye shall serve:I have given your priest's office [unto you as] a service of gift: andthe stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death.   

{18:8} And the LORD spake unto Aaron, Behold, I also have given theethe charge of mine heave offerings of all the hallowed things of thechildren of Israel; unto thee have I given them by reason of theanointing, and to thy sons, by an ordinance for ever. 

{18:9} This shallbe thine of the most holy things, [reserved] from the fire: everyoblation of theirs, every meat offering of theirs, and every sinoffering of theirs, and every trespass offering of theirs, which theyshall render unto me, [shall be] most holy for thee and for thy sons.

{18:10} In the most holy [place] shalt thou eat it; every male shalleat it: it shall be holy unto thee. 

{18:11} And this [is] thine; theheave offering of their gift, with all the wave offerings of thechildren of Israel: I have given them unto thee, and to thy sons and tothy daughters with thee, by a statute for ever: every one that is cleanin thy house shall eat of it. 

{18:12} All the best of the oil, and allthe best of the wine, and of the wheat, the firstfruits of them whichthey shall offer unto the LORD, them have I given thee. 

{18:13} [And]whatsoever is first ripe in the land, which they shall bring unto theLORD, shall be thine; every one that is clean in thine house shall eat[of] it. 

{18:14} Every thing devoted in Israel shall be thine. 

{18:15}Every thing that openeth the matrix in all flesh, which they bring untothe LORD, [whether it be] of men or beasts, shall be thine:nevertheless the firstborn of man shalt thou surely redeem, and thefirstling of unclean beasts shalt thou redeem. 

{18:16} And those thatare to be redeemed from a month old shalt thou redeem, according tothine estimation, for the money of five shekels, after the shekel ofthe sanctuary, which [is] twenty gerahs. 

{18:17} But the firstling of acow, or the firstling of a sheep, or the firstling of a goat, thoushalt not redeem; they [are] holy: thou shalt sprinkle their blood uponthe altar, and shalt burn their fat [for] an offering made by fire, fora sweet savour unto the LORD. 

{18:18} And the flesh of them shall bethine, as the wave breast and as the right shoulder are thine. 

{18:19}All the heave offerings of the holy things, which the children ofIsrael offer unto the LORD, have I given thee, and thy sons and thydaughters with thee, by a statute for ever: it is a covenant of saltfor ever before the LORD unto thee and to thy seed with thee.   

{18:20} And the LORD spake unto Aaron, Thou shalt have noinheritance in their land, neither shalt thou have any part among them:I [am] thy part and thine inheritance among the children of Israel.

{18:21} And, behold, I have given the children of Levi all the tenth inIsrael for an inheritance, for their service which they serve, [even]the service of the tabernacle of the congregation. 

{18:22} Neither mustthe children of Israel henceforth come nigh the tabernacle of thecongregation, lest they bear sin, and die. 

{18:23} But the Levitesshall do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation, and theyshall bear their iniquity: [it shall be] a statute for ever throughoutyour generations, that among the children of Israel they have noinheritance. 

{18:24} But the tithes of the children of Israel, whichthey offer [as] an heave offering unto the LORD, I have given to theLevites to inherit: therefore I have said unto them, Among the childrenof Israel they shall have no inheritance.   

{18:25} And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 

{18:26} Thus speakunto the Levites, and say unto them, When ye take of the children ofIsrael the tithes which I have given you from them for yourinheritance, then ye shall offer up an heave offering of it for theLORD, [even] a tenth [part] of the tithe. 

{18:27} And [this] your heaveoffering shall be reckoned unto you, as though [it were] the corn ofthe threshingfloor, and as the fulness of the winepress. 

{18:28} Thusye also shall offer an heave offering unto the LORD of all your tithes,which ye receive of the children of Israel; and ye shall give thereofthe LORD'S heave offering to Aaron the priest. 

{18:29} Out of all yourgifts ye shall offer every heave offering of the LORD, of all the bestthereof, [even] the hallowed part thereof out of it. 

{18:30} Thereforethou shalt say unto them, When ye have heaved the best thereof from it,then it shall be counted unto the Levites as the increase of thethreshingfloor, and as the increase of the winepress. 

{18:31} And yeshall eat it in every place, ye and your households: for it [is] yourreward for your service in the tabernacle of the congregation. 

{18:32}And ye shall bear no sin by reason of it, when ye have heaved from itthe best of it: neither shall ye pollute the holy things of thechildren of Israel, lest ye die.   

{19:1} And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying, 

{19:2}This [is] the ordinance of the law which the LORD hath commanded,saying, Speak unto the children of Israel, that they bring thee a redheifer without spot, wherein [is] no blemish, [and] upon which nevercame yoke: 

{19:3} And ye shall give her unto Eleazar the priest, thathe may bring her forth without the camp, and [one] shall slay herbefore his face: 

{19:4} And Eleazar the priest shall take of her bloodwith his finger, and sprinkle of her blood directly before thetabernacle of the congregation seven times: 

{19:5} And [one] shall burnthe heifer in his sight; her skin, and her flesh, and her blood, withher dung, shall he burn: 

{19:6} And the priest shall take cedar wood,and hyssop, and scarlet, and cast [it] into the midst of the burning ofthe heifer. 

{19:7} Then the priest shall wash his clothes, and he shallbathe his flesh in water, and afterward he shall come into the camp,and the priest shall be unclean until the even. 

{19:8} And he thatburneth her shall wash his clothes in water, and bathe his flesh inwater, and shall be unclean until the even. 

{19:9} And a man [that is]clean shall gather up the ashes of the heifer, and lay [them] upwithout the camp in a clean place, and it shall be kept for thecongregation of the children of Israel for a water of separation: it[is] a purification for sin. 

{19:10} And he that gathereth the ashes ofthe heifer shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even: andit shall be unto the children of Israel, and unto the stranger thatsojourneth among them, for a statute for ever.   

{19:11} He that toucheth the dead body of any man shall be uncleanseven days. 

{19:12} He shall purify himself with it on the third day,and on the seventh day he shall be clean: but if he purify not himselfthe third day, then the seventh day he shall not be clean. 

{19:13}Whosoever toucheth the dead body of any man that is dead, and purifiethnot himself, defileth the tabernacle of the LORD; and that soul shallbe cut off from Israel: because the water of separation was notsprinkled upon him, he shall be unclean; his uncleanness [is] yet uponhim. 

{19:14} This [is] the law, when a man dieth in a tent: all thatcome into the tent, and all that [is] in the tent, shall be uncleanseven days. 

{19:15} And every open vessel, which hath no covering boundupon it, [is] unclean. 

{19:16} And whosoever toucheth one that is slainwith a sword in the open fields, or a dead body, or a bone of a man, ora grave, shall be unclean seven days. 

{19:17} And for an unclean[person] they shall take of the ashes of the burnt heifer ofpurification for sin, and running water shall be put thereto in avessel: 

{19:18} And a clean person shall take hyssop, and dip [it] inthe water, and sprinkle [it] upon the tent, and upon all the vessels,and upon the persons that were there, and upon him that touched a bone,or one slain, or one dead, or a grave: 

{19:19} And the clean [person]shall sprinkle upon the unclean on the third day, and on the seventhday: and on the seventh day he shall purify himself, and wash hisclothes, and bathe himself in water, and shall be clean at even.

{19:20} But the man that shall be unclean, and shall not purifyhimself, that soul shall be cut off from among the congregation,because he hath defiled the sanctuary of the LORD: the water ofseparation hath not been sprinkled upon him; he [is] unclean. 

{19:21}And it shall be a perpetual statute unto them, that he that sprinkleththe water of separation shall wash his clothes; and he that toucheththe water of separation shall be unclean until even. 

{19:22} Andwhatsoever the unclean [person] toucheth shall be unclean; and the soulthat toucheth [it] shall be unclean until even.   

{20:1} Then came the children of Israel, [even] the wholecongregation, into the desert of Zin in the first month: and the peopleabode in Kadesh; and Miriam died there, and was buried there. 

{20:2}And there was no water for the congregation: and they gatheredthemselves together against Moses and against Aaron. 

{20:3} And thepeople chode with Moses, and spake, saying, Would God that we had diedwhen our brethren died before the LORD! 

{20:4} And why have ye broughtup the congregation of the LORD into this wilderness, that we and ourcattle should die there? 

{20:5} And wherefore have ye made us to comeup out of Egypt, to bring us in unto this evil place? it [is] no placeof seed, or of figs, or of vines, or of pomegranates; neither [is]there any water to drink. 

{20:6} And Moses and Aaron went from thepresence of the assembly unto the door of the tabernacle of thecongregation, and they fell upon their faces: and the glory of the LORDappeared unto them.   

{20:7} And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 

{20:8} Take the rod,and gather thou the assembly together, thou, and Aaron thy brother, andspeak ye unto the rock before their eyes; and it shall give forth hiswater, and thou shalt bring forth to them water out of the rock: sothou shalt give the congregation and their beasts drink. 

{20:9} AndMoses took the rod from before the LORD, as he commanded him. 

{20:10}And Moses and Aaron gathered the congregation together before the rock,and he said unto them, Hear now, ye rebels; must we fetch you water outof this rock? 

{20:11} And Moses lifted up his hand, and with his rod hesmote the rock twice: and the water came out abundantly, and thecongregation drank, and their beasts [also.]   

{20:12} And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron, Because ye believedme not, to sanctify me in the eyes of the children of Israel, thereforeye shall not bring this congregation into the land which I have giventhem. 

{20:13} This [is] the water of Meribah; because the children ofIsrael strove with the LORD, and he was sanctified in them.   

{20:14} And Moses sent messengers from Kadesh unto the king of Edom,Thus saith thy brother Israel, Thou knowest all the travail that hathbefallen us: 

{20:15} How our fathers went down into Egypt, and we havedwelt in Egypt a long time; and the Egyptians vexed us, and ourfathers: 

{20:16} And when we cried unto the LORD, he heard our voice,and sent an angel, and hath brought us forth out of Egypt: and, behold,we [are] in Kadesh, a city in the uttermost of thy border: 

{20:17} Letus pass, I pray thee, through thy country: we will not pass through thefields, or through the vineyards, neither will we drink [of] the waterof the wells: we will go by the king's [high] way, we will not turn tothe right hand nor to the left, until we have passed thy borders.

{20:18} And Edom said unto him, Thou shalt not pass by me, lest I comeout against thee with the sword. 

{20:19} And the children of Israelsaid unto him, We will go by the high way: and if I and my cattle drinkof thy water, then I will pay for it: I will only, without [doing] anything [else,] go through on my feet. 

{20:20} And he said, Thou shaltnot go through. And Edom came out against him with much people, andwith a strong hand. 

{20:21} Thus Edom refused to give Israel passagethrough his border: wherefore Israel turned away from him.   

{20:22} And the children of Israel, [even] the whole congregation,journeyed from Kadesh, and came unto mount Hor. 

{20:23} And the LORDspake unto Moses and Aaron in mount Hor, by the coast of the land ofEdom, saying, 

{20:24} Aaron shall be gathered unto his people: for heshall not enter into the land which I have given unto the children ofIsrael, because ye rebelled against my word at the water of Meribah.

{20:25} Take Aaron and Eleazar his son, and bring them up unto mountHor: 

{20:26} And strip Aaron of his garments, and put them upon Eleazarhis son: and Aaron shall be gathered [unto his people,] and shall diethere. 

{20:27} And Moses did as the LORD commanded: and they went upinto mount Hor in the sight of all the congregation. 

{20:28} And Mosesstripped Aaron of his garments, and put them upon Eleazar his son; andAaron died there in the top of the mount: and Moses and Eleazar camedown from the mount. 

{20:29} And when all the congregation saw thatAaron was dead, they mourned for Aaron thirty days, [even] all thehouse of Israel.   

{21:1} And [when] king Arad the Canaanite, which dwelt in the south,heard tell that Israel came by the way of the spies; then he foughtagainst Israel, and took [some] of them prisoners. 

{21:2} And Israelvowed a vow unto the LORD, and said, If thou wilt indeed deliver thispeople into my hand, then I will utterly destroy their cities. 

{21:3}And the LORD hearkened to the voice of Israel, and delivered up theCanaanites; and they utterly destroyed them and their cities: and hecalled the name of the place Hormah.   

{21:4} And they journeyed from mount Hor by the way of the Red sea,to compass the land of Edom: and the soul of the people was muchdiscouraged because of the way. 

{21:5} And the people spake againstGod, and against Moses, Wherefore have ye brought us up out of Egypt todie in the wilderness? for [there is] no bread, neither [is there any]water; and our soul loatheth this light bread. 

{21:6} And the LORD sentfiery serpents among the people, and they bit the people; and muchpeople of Israel died.   

{21:7} Therefore the people came to Moses, and said, We have sinned,for we have spoken against the LORD, and against thee; pray unto theLORD, that he take away the serpents from us. And Moses prayed for thepeople. 

{21:8} And the LORD said unto Moses, Make thee a fiery serpent,and set it upon a pole: and it shall come to pass, that every one thatis bitten, when he looketh upon it, shall live. 

{21:9} And Moses made aserpent of brass, and put it upon a pole, and it came to pass, that ifa serpent had bitten any man, when he beheld the serpent of brass, helived.   

{21:10} And the children of Israel set forward, and pitched inOboth. 

{21:11} And they journeyed from Oboth, and pitched atIje-abarim, in the wilderness which [is] before Moab, toward thesunrising.   

{21:12} From thence they removed, and pitched in the valley ofZared. 

{21:13} From thence they removed, and pitched on the other sideof Arnon, which [is] in the wilderness that cometh out of the coasts ofthe Amorites: for Arnon [is] the border of Moab, between Moab and theAmorites. 

{21:14} Wherefore it is said in the book of the wars of theLORD, What he did in the Red sea, and in the brooks of Arnon, 

{21:15}And at the stream of the brooks that goeth down to the dwelling of Ar,and lieth upon the border of Moab. 

{21:16} And from thence [they went]to Beer: that [is] the well whereof the LORD spake unto Moses, Gatherthe people together, and I will give them water.   

{21:17} Then Israel sang this song, Spring up, O well; sing ye untoit: 

{21:18} The princes digged the well, the nobles of the peopledigged it, by [the direction of] the lawgiver, with their staves. Andfrom the wilderness [they went] to Mattanah: 

{21:19} And from Mattanahto Nahaliel: and from Nahaliel to Bamoth: 

{21:20} And from Bamoth [in]the valley, that [is] in the country of Moab, to the top of Pisgah,which looketh toward Jeshimon.   

{21:21} And Israel sent messengers unto Sihon king of the Amorites,saying, 

{21:22} Let me pass through thy land: we will not turn into thefields, or into the vineyards; we will not drink [of] the waters of thewell: [but] we will go along by the king's [high] way, until we be pastthy borders. 

{21:23} And Sihon would not suffer Israel to pass throughhis border: but Sihon gathered all his people together, and went outagainst Israel into the wilderness: and he came to Jahaz, and foughtagainst Israel. 

{21:24} And Israel smote him with the edge of thesword, and possessed his land from Arnon unto Jabbok, even unto thechildren of Ammon: for the border of the children of Ammon [was]strong. 

{21:25} And Israel took all these cities: and Israel dwelt inall the cities of the Amorites, in Heshbon, and in all the villagesthereof. 

{21:26} For Heshbon [was] the city of Sihon the king of theAmorites, who had fought against the former king of Moab, and taken allhis land out of his hand, even unto Arnon. 

{21:27} Wherefore they thatspeak in proverbs say, Come into Heshbon, let the city of Sihon bebuilt and prepared: 

{21:28} For there is a fire gone out of Heshbon, aflame from the city of Sihon: it hath consumed Ar of Moab, [and] thelords of the high places of Arnon. 

{21:29} Woe to thee, Moab! thou artundone, O people of Chemosh: he hath given his sons that escaped, andhis daughters, into captivity unto Sihon king of the Amorites. 

{21:30}We have shot at them; Heshbon is perished even unto Dibon, and we havelaid them waste even unto Nophah, which [reacheth] unto Medeba.   

{21:31} Thus Israel dwelt in the land of the Amorites. 

{21:32} AndMoses sent to spy out Jaazer, and they took the villages thereof, anddrove out the Amorites that [were] there.   

{21:33} And they turned and went up by the way of Bashan: and Og theking of Bashan went out against them, he, and all his people, to thebattle at Edrei. 

{21:34} And the LORD said unto Moses, Fear him not:for I have delivered him into thy hand, and all his people, and hisland; and thou shalt do to him as thou didst unto Sihon king of theAmorites, which dwelt at Heshbon. 

{21:35} So they smote him, and hissons, and all his people, until there was none left him alive: and theypossessed his land.   

{22:1} And the children of Israel set forward, and pitched in theplains of Moab on this side Jordan [by] Jericho.   

{22:2} And Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done tothe Amorites. 

{22:3} And Moab was sore afraid of the people, becausethey [were] many: and Moab was distressed because of the children ofIsrael. 

{22:4} And Moab said unto the elders of Midian, Now shall thiscompany lick up all [that are] round about us, as the ox licketh up thegrass of the field. And Balak the son of Zippor [was] king of theMoabites at that time. 

{22:5} He sent messengers therefore unto Balaamthe son of Beor to Pethor, which [is] by the river of the land of thechildren of his people, to call him, saying, Behold, there is a peoplecome out from Egypt: behold, they cover the face of the earth, and theyabide over against me: 

{22:6} Come now therefore, I pray thee, curse methis people; for they [are] too mighty for me: peradventure I shallprevail, [that] we may smite them, and [that] I may drive them out ofthe land: for I wot that he whom thou blessest [is] blessed, and hewhom thou cursest is cursed. 

{22:7} And the elders of Moab and theelders of Midian departed with the rewards of divination in their hand;and they came unto Balaam, and spake unto him the words of Balak.

{22:8} And he said unto them, Lodge here this night, and I will bringyou word again, as the LORD shall speak unto me: and the princes ofMoab abode with Balaam. 

{22:9} And God came unto Balaam, and said, Whatmen [are] these with thee? 

{22:10} And Balaam said unto God, Balak theson of Zippor, king of Moab, hath sent unto me, [saying, ]

{22:11}Behold, [there is] a people come out of Egypt, which covereth the faceof the earth: come now, curse me them; peradventure I shall be able toovercome them, and drive them out. 

{22:12} And God said unto Balaam,Thou shalt not go with them; thou shalt not curse the people: for they[are] blessed. 

{22:13} And Balaam rose up in the morning, and said untothe princes of Balak, Get you into your land: for the LORD refuseth togive me leave to go with you. 

{22:14} And the princes of Moab rose up,and they went unto Balak, and said, Balaam refuseth to come with us.   

{22:15} And Balak sent yet again princes, more, and more honourablethan they. 

{22:16} And they came to Balaam, and said to him, Thus saithBalak the son of Zippor, Let nothing, I pray thee, hinder thee fromcoming unto me: 

{22:17} For I will promote thee unto very great honour,and I will do whatsoever thou sayest unto me: come therefore, I praythee, curse me this people. 

{22:18} And Balaam answered and said untothe servants of Balak, If Balak would give me his house full of silverand gold, I cannot go beyond the word of the LORD my God, to do less ormore. 

{22:19} Now therefore, I pray you, tarry ye also here this night,that I may know what the LORD will say unto me more. 

{22:20} And Godcame unto Balaam at night, and said unto him, If the men come to callthee, rise up, [and] go with them; but yet the word which I shall sayunto thee, that shalt thou do. 

{22:21} And Balaam rose up in themorning, and saddled his ass, and went with the princes of Moab.   

{22:22} And God's anger was kindled because he went: and the angelof the LORD stood in the way for an adversary against him. Now he wasriding upon his ass, and his two servants [were] with him. 

{22:23} Andthe ass saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way, and his sworddrawn in his hand: and the ass turned aside out of the way, and wentinto the field: and Balaam smote the ass, to turn her into the way.

{22:24} But the angel of the LORD stood in a path of the vineyards, awall [being] on this side, and a wall on that side. 

{22:25} And whenthe ass saw the angel of the LORD, she thrust herself unto the wall,and crushed Balaam's foot against the wall: and he smote her again.

{22:26} And the angel of the LORD went further, and stood in a narrowplace, where [was] no way to turn either to the right hand or to theleft. 

{22:27} And when the ass saw the angel of the LORD, she fell downunder Balaam: and Balaam's anger was kindled, and he smote the ass witha staff. 

{22:28} And the LORD opened the mouth of the ass, and she saidunto Balaam, What have I done unto thee, that thou hast smitten methese three times? 

{22:29} And Balaam said unto the ass, Because thouhast mocked me: I would there were a sword in mine hand, for now wouldI kill thee. 

{22:30} And the ass said unto Balaam, [Am] not I thineass, upon which thou hast ridden ever since [I was] thine unto thisday? was I ever wont to do so unto thee? And he said, Nay. 

{22:31} Thenthe LORD opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel of the LORDstanding in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand: and he bowed downhis head, and fell flat on his face. 

{22:32} And the angel of the LORDsaid unto him, Wherefore hast thou smitten thine ass these three times?behold, I went out to withstand thee, because [thy] way is perversebefore me: 

{22:33} And the ass saw me, and turned from me these threetimes: unless she had turned from me, surely now also I had slain thee,and saved her alive. 

{22:34} And Balaam said unto the angel of theLORD, I have sinned; for I knew not that thou stoodest in the wayagainst me: now therefore, if it displease thee, I will get me backagain. 

{22:35} And the angel of the LORD said unto Balaam, Go with themen: but only the word that I shall speak unto thee, that thou shaltspeak. So Balaam went with the princes of Balak.   

{22:36} And when Balak heard that Balaam was come, he went out tomeet him unto a city of Moab, which [is] in the border of Arnon, which[is] in the utmost coast. 

{22:37} And Balak said unto Balaam, Did I notearnestly send unto thee to call thee? wherefore camest thou not untome? am I not able indeed to promote thee to honour? 

{22:38} And Balaamsaid unto Balak, Lo, I am come unto thee: have I now any power at allto say any thing? the word that God putteth in my mouth, that shall Ispeak. 

{22:39} And Balaam went with Balak, and they came untoKirjath-huzoth. 

{22:40} And Balak offered oxen and sheep, and sent toBalaam, and to the princes that [were] with him. 

{22:41} And it came topass on the morrow, that Balak took Balaam, and brought him up into thehigh places of Baal, that thence he might see the utmost [part] of thepeople.   

{23:1} And Balaam said unto Balak, Build me here seven altars, andprepare me here seven oxen and seven rams. 

{23:2} And Balak did asBalaam had spoken; and Balak and Balaam offered on [every] altar abullock and a ram. 

{23:3} And Balaam said unto Balak, Stand by thyburnt offering, and I will go: peradventure the LORD will come to meetme: and whatsoever he sheweth me I will tell thee. And he went to anhigh place. 

{23:4} And God met Balaam: and he said unto him, I haveprepared seven altars, and I have offered upon [every] altar a bullockand a ram. 

{23:5} And the LORD put a word in Balaam's mouth, and said,Return unto Balak, and thus thou shalt speak. 

{23:6} And he returnedunto him, and, lo, he stood by his burnt sacrifice, he, and all theprinces of Moab. 

{23:7} And he took up his parable, and said, Balak theking of Moab hath brought me from Aram, out of the mountains of theeast, [saying,] Come, curse me Jacob, and come, defy Israel. 

{23:8} Howshall I curse, whom God hath not cursed? or how shall I defy, [whom]the LORD hath not defied? 

{23:9} For from the top of the rocks I seehim, and from the hills I behold him: lo, the people shall dwell alone,and shall not be reckoned among the nations. 

{23:10} Who can count thedust of Jacob, and the number of the fourth [part] of Israel? Let medie the death of the righteous, and let my last end be like his!

{23:11} And Balak said unto Balaam, What hast thou done unto me? I tookthee to curse mine enemies, and, behold, thou hast blessed [them]altogether. 

{23:12} And he answered and said, Must I not take heed tospeak that which the LORD hath put in my mouth? 

{23:13} And Balak saidunto him, Come, I pray thee, with me unto another place, from whencethou mayest see them: thou shalt see but the utmost part of them, andshalt not see them all: and curse me them from thence.   

{23:14} And he brought him into the field of Zophim, to the top ofPisgah, and built seven altars, and offered a bullock and a ram on[every] altar. 

{23:15} And he said unto Balak, Stand here by thy burntoffering, while I meet [the LORD] yonder. 

{23:16} And the LORD metBalaam, and put a word in his mouth, and said, Go again unto Balak, andsay thus. 

{23:17} And when he came to him, behold, he stood by hisburnt offering, and the princes of Moab with him. And Balak said untohim, What hath the LORD spoken? 

{23:18} And he took up his parable, andsaid, Rise up, Balak, and hear; hearken unto me, thou son of Zippor:

{23:19} God [is] not a man, that he should lie; neither the son of man,that he should repent: hath he said, and shall he not do [it?] or hathhe spoken, and shall he not make it good? 

{23:20} Behold, I havereceived [commandment] to bless: and he hath blessed; and I cannotreverse it. 

{23:21} He hath not beheld iniquity in Jacob, neither hathhe seen perverseness in Israel: the LORD his God [is] with him, and theshout of a king [is] among them. 

{23:22} God brought them out of Egypt;he hath as it were the strength of an unicorn. 

{23:23} Surely [thereis] no enchantment against Jacob, neither [is there] any divinationagainst Israel: according to this time it shall be said of Jacob and ofIsrael, What hath God wrought! 

{23:24} Behold, the people shall rise upas a great lion, and lift up himself as a young lion: he shall not liedown until he eat [of] the prey, and drink the blood of the slain.   

{23:25} And Balak said unto Balaam, Neither curse them at all, norbless them at all. 

{23:26} But Balaam answered and said unto Balak,Told not I thee, saying, All that the LORD speaketh, that I must do?   

{23:27} And Balak said unto Balaam, Come, I pray thee, I will bringthee unto another place; peradventure it will please God that thoumayest curse me them from thence. 

{23:28} And Balak brought Balaam untothe top of Peor, that looketh toward Jeshimon. 

{23:29} And Balaam saidunto Balak, Build me here seven altars, and prepare me here sevenbullocks and seven rams. 

{23:30} And Balak did as Balaam had said, andoffered a bullock and a ram on [every] altar.   

{24:1} And when Balaam saw that it pleased the LORD to bless Israel,he went not, as at other times, to seek for enchantments, but he sethis face toward the wilderness. 

{24:2} And Balaam lifted up his eyes,and he saw Israel abiding [in his tents] according to their tribes; andthe spirit of God came upon him. 

{24:3} And he took up his parable, andsaid, Balaam the son of Beor hath said, and the man whose eyes are openhath said: 

{24:4} He hath said, which heard the words of God, which sawthe vision of the Almighty, falling [into a trance,] but having hiseyes open: 

{24:5} How goodly are thy tents, O Jacob, [and] thytabernacles, O Israel! 

{24:6} As the valleys are they spread forth, asgardens by the river's side, as the trees of lign aloes which the LORDhath planted, [and] as cedar trees beside the waters. 

{24:7} He shallpour the water out of his buckets, and his seed [shall be] in manywaters, and his king shall be higher than Agag, and his kingdom shallbe exalted. 

{24:8} God brought him forth out of Egypt; he hath as itwere the strength of an unicorn: he shall eat up the nations hisenemies, and shall break their bones, and pierce [them] through withhis arrows. 

{24:9} He couched, he lay down as a lion, and as a greatlion: who shall stir him up? Blessed [is] he that blesseth thee, andcursed is he that curseth thee.   

{24:10} And Balak's anger was kindled against Balaam, and he smotehis hands together: and Balak said unto Balaam, I called thee to cursemine enemies, and, behold, thou hast altogether blessed [them] thesethree times. 

{24:11} Therefore now flee thou to thy place: I thought topromote thee unto great honour; but, lo, the LORD hath kept thee backfrom honour. 

{24:12} And Balaam said unto Balak, Spake I not also tothy messengers which thou sentest unto me, saying, 

{24:13} If Balakwould give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond thecommandment of the LORD, to do [either] good or bad of mine own mind;[but] what the LORD saith, that will I speak? 

{24:14} And now, behold,I go unto my people: come [therefore, and] I will advertise thee whatthis people shall do to thy people in the latter days.   

{24:15} And he took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of Beorhath said, and the man whose eyes are open hath said: 

{24:16} He hathsaid, which heard the words of God, and knew the knowledge of the mostHigh, [which] saw the vision of the Almighty, falling [into a trance,]but having his eyes open: 

{24:17} I shall see him, but not now: I shallbehold him, but not nigh: there shall come a Star out of Jacob, and aSceptre shall rise out of Israel, and shall smite the corners of Moab,and destroy all the children of Sheth. 

{24:18} And Edom shall be apossession, Seir also shall be a possession for his enemies; and Israelshall do valiantly. 

{24:19} Out of Jacob shall come he that shall havedominion, and shall destroy him that remaineth of the city.   

{24:20} And when he looked on Amalek, he took up his parable, andsaid, Amalek [was] the first of the nations; but his latter end [shallbe] that he perish for ever. 

{24:21} And he looked on the Kenites, andtook up his parable, and said, Strong is thy dwellingplace, and thouputtest thy nest in a rock. 

{24:22} Nevertheless the Kenite shall bewasted, until Asshur shall carry thee away captive. 

{24:23} And he tookup his parable, and said, Alas, who shall live when God doeth this!

{24:24} And ships [shall come] from the coast of Chittim, and shallafflict Asshur, and shall afflict Eber, and he also shall perish forever. 

{24:25} And Balaam rose up, and went and returned to his place:and Balak also went his way.   

{25:1} And Israel abode in Shittim, and the people began to commitwhoredom with the daughters of Moab. 

{25:2} And they called the peopleunto the sacrifices of their gods: and the people did eat, and boweddown to their gods. 

{25:3} And Israel joined himself unto Baal-peor:and the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel. 

{25:4} And theLORD said unto Moses, Take all the heads of the people, and hang themup before the LORD against the sun, that the fierce anger of the LORDmay be turned away from Israel. 

{25:5} And Moses said unto the judgesof Israel, Slay ye every one his men that were joined unto Baal-peor.   

{25:6} And, behold, one of the children of Israel came and broughtunto his brethren a Midianitish woman in the sight of Moses, and in thesight of all the congregation of the children of Israel, who [were]weeping [before] the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. 

{25:7}And when Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, saw[it,] he rose up from among the congregation, and took a javelin in hishand; 

{25:8} And he went after the man of Israel into the tent, andthrust both of them through, the man of Israel, and the woman throughher belly. So the plague was stayed from the children of Israel. 

{25:9}And those that died in the plague were twenty and four thousand.   

{25:10} And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 

{25:11} Phinehas, theson of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, hath turned my wrath awayfrom the children of Israel, while he was zealous for my sake amongthem, that I consumed not the children of Israel in my jealousy.

{25:12} Wherefore say, Behold, I give unto him my covenant of peace:

{25:13} And he shall have it, and his seed after him, [even] thecovenant of an everlasting priesthood; because he was zealous for hisGod, and made an atonement for the children of Israel. 

{25:14} Now thename of the Israelite that was slain, [even] that was slain with theMidianitish woman, [was] Zimri, the son of Salu, a prince of a chiefhouse among the Simeonites. 

{25:15} And the name of the Midianitishwoman that was slain [was] Cozbi, the daughter of Zur; he [was] headover a people, [and] of a chief house in Midian.   

{25:16} And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 

{25:17} Vex theMidianites, and smite them: 

{25:18} For they vex you with their wiles,wherewith they have beguiled you in the matter of Peor, and in thematter of Cozbi, the daughter of a prince of Midian, their sister,which was slain in the day of the plague for Peor's sake.   

{26:1} And it came to pass after the plague, that the LORD spakeunto Moses and unto Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, saying, 

{26:2}Take the sum of all the congregation of the children of Israel, fromtwenty years old and upward, throughout their fathers' house, all thatare able to go to war in Israel. 

{26:3} And Moses and Eleazar thepriest spake with them in the plains of Moab by Jordan [near] Jericho,saying,

{26:59} And the name of Amram's wife [was] Jochebed, thedaughter of Levi, whom [her mother] bare to Levi in Egypt: and she bareunto Amram Aaron and Moses, and Miriam their sister. 

{26:60} And untoAaron was born Nadab, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar. 

{26:61} AndNadab and Abihu died, when they offered strange fire before the LORD.

{26:62} And those that were numbered of them were twenty and threethousand, all males from a month old and upward: for they were notnumbered among the children of Israel, because there was no inheritancegiven them among the children of Israel.   

{26:63} These [are] they that were numbered by Moses and Eleazar thepriest, who numbered the children of Israel in the plains of Moab byJordan [near] Jericho. 

{26:64} But among these there was not a man ofthem whom Moses and Aaron the priest numbered, when they numbered thechildren of Israel in the wilderness of Sinai. 

{26:65} For the LORD hadsaid of them, They shall surely die in the wilderness. And there wasnot left a man of them, save Caleb the son of Jephunneh, and Joshua theson of Nun.   

{27:1} Then came the daughters of Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, theson of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the familiesof Manasseh the son of Joseph: and these are the names of hisdaughters; Mahlah, Noah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Tirzah. 

{27:2} Andthey stood before Moses, and before Eleazar the priest, and before theprinces and all the congregation, [by] the door of the tabernacle ofthe congregation, saying, 

{27:3} Our father died in the wilderness, andhe was not in the company of them that gathered themselves togetheragainst the LORD in the company of Korah; but died in his own sin, andhad no sons. 

{27:4} Why should the name of our father be done away fromamong his family, because he hath no son? Give unto us [therefore] apossession among the brethren of our father. 

{27:5} And Moses broughttheir cause before the LORD.   

{27:6} And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 

{27:7} The daughtersof Zelophehad speak right: thou shalt surely give them a possession ofan inheritance among their father's brethren; and thou shalt cause theinheritance of their father to pass unto them. 

{27:8} And thou shaltspeak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a man die, and have noson, then ye shall cause his inheritance to pass unto his daughter.

{27:9} And if he have no daughter, then ye shall give his inheritanceunto his brethren. 

{27:10} And if he have no brethren, then ye shallgive his inheritance unto his father's brethren. 

{27:11} And if hisfather have no brethren, then ye shall give his inheritance unto hiskinsman that is next to him of his family, and he shall possess it: andit shall be unto the children of Israel a statute of judgment, as theLORD commanded Moses.   

{27:12} And the LORD said unto Moses, Get thee up into this mountAbarim, and see the land which I have given unto the children ofIsrael. 

{27:13} And when thou hast seen it, thou also shalt be gatheredunto thy people, as Aaron thy brother was gathered. 

{27:14} For yerebelled against my commandment in the desert of Zin, in the strife ofthe congregation, to sanctify me at the water before their eyes: that[is] the water of Meribah in Kadesh in the wilderness of Zin.   

{27:15} And Moses spake unto the LORD, saying, 

{27:16} Let the LORD,the God of the spirits of all flesh, set a man over the congregation,

{27:17} Which may go out before them, and which may go in before them,and which may lead them out, and which may bring them in; that thecongregation of the LORD be not as sheep which have no shepherd.   

{27:18} And the LORD said unto Moses, Take thee Joshua the son ofNun, a man in whom [is] the spirit, and lay thine hand upon him;

{27:19} And set him before Eleazar the priest, and before all thecongregation; and give him a charge in their sight. 

{27:20} And thoushalt put some of thine honour upon him, that all the congregation ofthe children of Israel may be obedient. 

{27:21} And he shall standbefore Eleazar the priest, who shall ask [counsel] for him after thejudgment of Urim before the LORD: at his word shall they go out, and athis word they shall come in, [both] he, and all the children of Israelwith him, even all the congregation. 

{27:22} And Moses did as the LORDcommanded him: and he took Joshua, and set him before Eleazar thepriest, and before all the congregation: 

{27:23} And he laid his handsupon him, and gave him a charge, as the LORD commanded by the hand ofMoses.   

{28:1} And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 

{28:2} Command thechildren of Israel, and say unto them, My offering, [and] my bread formy sacrifices made by fire, [for] a sweet savour unto me, shall yeobserve to offer unto me in their due season. 

{28:3} And thou shalt sayunto them, This is the offering made by fire which ye shall offer untothe LORD; two lambs of the first year without spot day by day, [for] acontinual burnt offering. 

{28:4} The one lamb shalt thou offer in themorning, and the other lamb shalt thou offer at even; 

{28:5} And atenth [part] of an ephah of flour for a meat offering, mingled with thefourth [part] of an hin of beaten oil. 

{28:6} [It is] a continual burntoffering, which was ordained in mount Sinai for a sweet savour, asacrifice made by fire unto the LORD. 

{28:7} And the drink offeringthereof [shall be] the fourth [part] of an hin for the one lamb: in theholy [place] shalt thou cause the strong wine to be poured unto theLORD [for] a drink offering. 

{28:8} And the other lamb shalt thou offerat even: as the meat offering of the morning, and as the drink offeringthereof, thou shalt offer [it,] a sacrifice made by fire, of a sweetsavour unto the LORD.   

{28:9} And on the sabbath day two lambs of the first year withoutspot, and two tenth deals of flour [for] a meat offering, mingled withoil, and the drink offering thereof: 

{28:10} [This is] the burntoffering of every sabbath, beside the continual burnt offering, and hisdrink offering.   

{28:11} And in the beginnings of your months ye shall offer a burntoffering unto the LORD; two young bullocks, and one ram, seven lambs ofthe first year without spot; 

{28:12} And three tenth deals of flour[for] a meat offering, mingled with oil, for one bullock; and two tenthdeals of flour [for] a meat offering, mingled with oil, for one ram;

{28:14} And their drink offeringsshall be half an hin of wine unto a bullock, and the third [part] of anhin unto a ram, and a fourth [part] of an hin unto a lamb: this [is]the burnt offering of every month throughout the months of the year.

{28:15} And one kid of the goats for a sin offering unto the LORD shallbe offered, beside the continual burnt offering, and his drinkoffering. 

{28:16} And in the fourteenth day of the first month [is] thepassover of the LORD.

{29:39} These [things] ye shall do unto the LORD in your setfeasts, beside your vows, and your freewill offerings, for your burntofferings, and for your meat offerings, and for your drink offerings,and for your peace offerings. 

{29:40} And Moses told the children ofIsrael according to all that the LORD commanded Moses.   

{30:1} And Moses spake unto the heads of the tribes concerning thechildren of Israel, saying, This is the thing which the LORD hathcommanded. 

{30:2} If a man vow a vow unto the LORD, or swear an oath tobind his soul with a bond; he shall not break his word, he shall doaccording to all that proceedeth out of his mouth. 

{30:3} If a womanalso vow a vow unto the LORD, and bind [herself] by a bond, [being] inher father's house in her youth; 

{30:4} And her father hear her vow,and her bond wherewith she hath bound her soul, and her father shallhold his peace at her: then all her vows shall stand, and every bondwherewith she hath bound her soul shall stand. 

{30:5} But if her fatherdisallow her in the day that he heareth; not any of her vows, or of herbonds wherewith she hath bound her soul, shall stand: and the LORDshall forgive her, because her father disallowed her. 

{30:6} And if shehad at all an husband, when she vowed, or uttered ought out of herlips, wherewith she bound her soul; 

{30:7} And her husband heard [it,]and held his peace at her in the day that he heard [it:] then her vowsshall stand, and her bonds wherewith she bound her soul shall stand.

{30:8} But if her husband disallowed her on the day that he heard [it;]then he shall make her vow which she vowed, and that which she utteredwith her lips, wherewith she bound her soul, of none effect: and theLORD shall forgive her. 

{30:9} But every vow of a widow, and of herthat is divorced, wherewith they have bound their souls, shall standagainst her. 

{30:10} And if she vowed in her husband's house, or boundher soul by a bond with an oath; 

{30:11} And her husband heard [it,]and held his peace at her, [and] disallowed her not: then all her vowsshall stand, and every bond wherewith she bound her soul shall stand.

{30:12} But if her husband hath utterly made them void on the day heheard [them; then] whatsoever proceeded out of her lips concerning hervows, or concerning the bond of her soul, shall not stand: her husbandhath made them void; and the LORD shall forgive her. 

{30:13} Every vow,and every binding oath to afflict the soul, her husband may establishit, or her husband may make it void. 

{30:14} But if her husbandaltogether hold his peace at her from day to day; then he establishethall her vows, or all her bonds, which [are] upon her: he confirmeththem, because he held his peace at her in the day that he heard [them.]

{30:15} But if he shall any ways make them void after that he hathheard [them;] then he shall bear her iniquity. 

{30:16} These [are] thestatutes, which the LORD commanded Moses, between a man and his wife,between the father and his daughter, [being yet] in her youth in herfather's house.   

{31:1} And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 

{31:2} Avenge thechildren of Israel of the Midianites: afterward shalt thou be gatheredunto thy people. 

{31:3} And Moses spake unto the people, saying, Armsome of yourselves unto the war, and let them go against theMidianites, and avenge the LORD of Midian. 

{31:4} Of every tribe athousand, throughout all the tribes of Israel, shall ye send to thewar. 

{31:5} So there were delivered out of the thousands of Israel, athousand of [every] tribe, twelve thousand armed for war. 

{31:6} AndMoses sent them to the war, a thousand of [every] tribe, them andPhinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, to the war, with the holyinstruments, and the trumpets to blow in his hand. 

{31:7} And theywarred against the Midianites, as the LORD commanded Moses; and theyslew all the males. 

{31:8} And they slew the kings of Midian, besidethe rest of them that were slain; [namely,] Evi, and Rekem, and Zur,and Hur, and Reba, five kings of Midian: Balaam also the son of Beorthey slew with the sword. 

{31:9} And the children of Israel took [all]the women of Midian captives, and their little ones, and took the spoilof all their cattle, and all their flocks, and all their goods. 

{31:10}And they burnt all their cities wherein they dwelt, and all theirgoodly castles, with fire. 

{31:11} And they took all the spoil, and allthe prey, [both] of men and of beasts. 

{31:12} And they brought thecaptives, and the prey, and the spoil, unto Moses, and Eleazar thepriest, and unto the congregation of the children of Israel, unto thecamp at the plains of Moab, which [are] by Jordan [near] Jericho.   

{31:13} And Moses, and Eleazar the priest, and all the princes ofthe congregation, went forth to meet them without the camp. 

{31:14} AndMoses was wroth with the officers of the host, [with] the captains overthousands, and captains over hundreds, which came from the battle.

{31:15} And Moses said unto them, Have ye saved all the women alive?

{31:16} Behold, these caused the children of Israel, through thecounsel of Balaam, to commit trespass against the LORD in the matter ofPeor, and there was a plague among the congregation of the LORD.

{31:17} Now therefore kill every male among the little ones, and killevery woman that hath known man by lying with him. 

{31:18} But all thewomen children, that have not known a man by lying with him, keep alivefor yourselves. 

{31:19} And do ye abide without the camp seven days:whosoever hath killed any person, and whosoever hath touched any slain,purify [both] yourselves and your captives on the third day, and on theseventh day. 

{31:20} And purify all [your] raiment, and all that ismade of skins, and all work of goats' [hair,] and all things made ofwood.   

{31:21} And Eleazar the priest said unto the men of war which wentto the battle, This is the ordinance of the law which the LORDcommanded Moses; 

{31:22} Only the gold, and the silver, the brass, theiron, the tin, and the lead, 

{31:23} Every thing that may abide thefire, ye shall make [it] go through the fire, and it shall be clean:nevertheless it shall be purified with the water of separation: and allthat abideth not the fire ye shall make go through the water. 

{31:24}And ye shall wash your clothes on the seventh day, and ye shall beclean, and afterward ye shall come into the camp.   

{31:25} And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 

{31:26} Take the sumof the prey that was taken, [both] of man and of beast, thou, andEleazar the priest, and the chief fathers of the congregation: 

{31:27}And divide the prey into two parts; between them that took the war uponthem, who went out to battle, and between all the congregation: 

{31:28}And levy a tribute unto the LORD of the men of war which went out tobattle: one soul of five hundred, [both] of the persons, and of thebeeves, and of the asses, and of the sheep: 

{31:29} Take [it] of theirhalf, and give [it] unto Eleazar the priest, [for] an heave offering ofthe LORD. 

{31:30} And of the children of Israel's half, thou shalt takeone portion of fifty, of the persons, of the beeves, of the asses, andof the flocks, of all manner of beasts, and give them unto the Levites,which keep the charge of the tabernacle of the LORD. 

{31:31} And Mosesand Eleazar the priest did as the LORD commanded Moses. 

{31:32} And thebooty, [being] the rest of the prey which the men of war had caught,was six hundred thousand and seventy thousand and five thousand sheep,

{31:33} And threescore and twelve thousand beeves, 

{31:34} Andthreescore and one thousand asses, 

{31:35} And thirty and two thousandpersons in all, of women that had not known man by lying with him.

{31:36} And the half, [which was] the portion of them that went out towar, was in number three hundred thousand and seven and thirty thousandand five hundred sheep: 

{31:37} And the LORD'S tribute of the sheep wassix hundred and threescore and fifteen. 

{31:38} And the beeves [were]thirty and six thousand; of which the LORD'S tribute [was] threescoreand twelve. 

{31:39} And the asses [were] thirty thousand and fivehundred; of which the LORD'S tribute [was] threescore and one. 

{31:40}And the persons [were] sixteen thousand; of which the LORD'S tribute[was] thirty and two persons. 

{31:41} And Moses gave the tribute,[which was] the LORD'S heave offering, unto Eleazar the priest, as theLORD commanded Moses. 

{31:42} And of the children of Israel's half,which Moses divided from the men that warred, 

{31:43} (Now the half[that pertained unto] the congregation was three hundred thousand andthirty thousand [and] seven thousand and five hundred sheep, 

{31:44}And thirty and six thousand beeves, 

{31:45} And thirty thousand assesand five hundred, 

{31:46} And sixteen thousand persons;) 

{31:47} Evenof the children of Israel's half, Moses took one portion of fifty,[both] of man and of beast, and gave them unto the Levites, which keptthe charge of the tabernacle of the LORD; as the LORD commanded Moses.   

{31:48} And the officers which [were] over thousands of the host,the captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds, came near untoMoses: 

{31:49} And they said unto Moses, Thy servants have taken thesum of the men of war which [are] under our charge, and there lackethnot one man of us. 

{31:50} We have therefore brought an oblation forthe LORD, what every man hath gotten, of jewels of gold, chains, andbracelets, rings, earrings, and tablets, to make an atonement for oursouls before the LORD. 

{31:51} And Moses and Eleazar the priest tookthe gold of them, [even] all wrought jewels. 

{31:52} And all the goldof the offering that they offered up to the LORD, of the captains ofthousands, and of the captains of hundreds, was sixteen thousand sevenhundred and fifty shekels. 

{31:53} ([For] the men of war had takenspoil, every man for himself.) 

{31:54} And Moses and Eleazar the priesttook the gold of the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and broughtit into the tabernacle of the congregation, [for] a memorial for thechildren of Israel before the LORD.   

{32:1} Now the children of Reuben and the children of Gad had a verygreat multitude of cattle: and when they saw the land of Jazer, and theland of Gilead, that, behold, the place [was] a place for cattle;

{32:2} The children of Gad and the children of Reuben came and spakeunto Moses, and to Eleazar the priest, and unto the princes of thecongregation, saying, 

{32:3} Ataroth, and Dibon, and Jazer, and Nimrah,and Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Shebam, and Nebo, and Beon, 

{32:4} [Even]the country which the LORD smote before the congregation of Israel,[is] a land for cattle, and thy servants have cattle: 

{32:5} Wherefore,said they, if we have found grace in thy sight, let this land be givenunto thy servants for a possession, [and] bring us not over Jordan.   

{32:6} And Moses said unto the children of Gad and to the childrenof Reuben, Shall your brethren go to war, and shall ye sit here? 

{32:7}And wherefore discourage ye the heart of the children of Israel fromgoing over into the land which the LORD hath given them? 

{32:8} Thusdid your fathers, when I sent them from Kadesh-barnea to see the land.

{32:9} For when they went up unto the valley of Eshcol, and saw theland, they discouraged the heart of the children of Israel, that theyshould not go into the land which the LORD had given them. 

{32:10} Andthe LORD'S anger was kindled the same time, and he sware, saying,

{32:11} Surely none of the men that came up out of Egypt, from twentyyears old and upward, shall see the land which I sware unto Abraham,unto Isaac, and unto Jacob; because they have not wholly followed me:

{32:12} Save Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite, and Joshua theson of Nun: for they have wholly followed the LORD. 

{32:13} And theLORD'S anger was kindled against Israel, and he made them wander in thewilderness forty years, until all the generation, that had done evil inthe sight of the LORD, was consumed. 

{32:14} And, behold, ye are risenup in your fathers' stead, an increase of sinful men, to augment yetthe fierce anger of the LORD toward Israel. 

{32:15} For if ye turn awayfrom after him, he will yet again leave them in the wilderness; and yeshall destroy all this people.   

{32:16} And they came near unto him, and said, We will buildsheepfolds here for our cattle, and cities for our little ones: 

{32:17}But we ourselves will go ready armed before the children of Israel,until we have brought them unto their place: and our little ones shalldwell in the fenced cities because of the inhabitants of the land.

{32:18} We will not return unto our houses, until the children ofIsrael have inherited every man his inheritance. 

{32:19} For we willnot inherit with them on yonder side Jordan, or forward; because ourinheritance is fallen to us on this side Jordan eastward.   

{32:20} And Moses said unto them, If ye will do this thing, if yewill go armed before the LORD to war, 

{32:21} And will go all of youarmed over Jordan before the LORD, until he hath driven out his enemiesfrom before him, 

{32:22} And the land be subdued before the LORD: thenafterward ye shall return, and be guiltless before the LORD, and beforeIsrael; and this land shall be your possession before the LORD. 

{32:23}But if ye will not do so, behold, ye have sinned against the LORD: andbe sure your sin will find you out. 

{32:24} Build you cities for yourlittle ones, and folds for your sheep; and do that which hath proceededout of your mouth. 

{32:25} And the children of Gad and the children ofReuben spake unto Moses, saying, Thy servants will do as my lordcommandeth. 

{32:26} Our little ones, our wives, our flocks, and all ourcattle, shall be there in the cities of Gilead: 

{32:27} But thyservants will pass over, every man armed for war, before the LORD tobattle, as my lord saith. 

{32:28} So concerning them Moses commandedEleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun, and the chief fathers ofthe tribes of the children of Israel: 

{32:29} And Moses said unto them,If the children of Gad and the children of Reuben will pass with youover Jordan, every man armed to battle, before the LORD, and the landshall be subdued before you; then ye shall give them the land of Gileadfor a possession: 

{32:30} But if they will not pass over with youarmed, they shall have possessions among you in the land of Canaan.

{32:31} And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben answered,saying, As the LORD hath said unto thy servants, so will we do. 

{32:32}We will pass over armed before the LORD into the land of Canaan, thatthe possession of our inheritance on this side Jordan [may be] ours.

{33:49} And they pitchedby Jordan, from Beth- jesimoth [even] unto Abel-shittim in the plainsof Moab.   

{33:50} And the LORD spake unto Moses in the plains of Moab byJordan [near] Jericho, saying, 

{33:51} Speak unto the children ofIsrael, and say unto them, When ye are passed over Jordan into the landof Canaan; 

{33:52} Then ye shall drive out all the inhabitants of theland from before you, and destroy all their pictures, and destroy alltheir molten images, and quite pluck down all their high places:

{33:53} And ye shall dispossess [the inhabitants] of the land, anddwell therein: for I have given you the land to possess it. 

{33:54} Andye shall divide the land by lot for an inheritance among your families:[and] to the more ye shall give the more inheritance, and to the fewerye shall give the less inheritance: every man's [inheritance] shall bein the place where his lot falleth; according to the tribes of yourfathers ye shall inherit. 

{33:55} But if ye will not drive out theinhabitants of the land from before you; then it shall come to pass,that those which ye let remain of them [shall be] pricks in your eyes,and thorns in your sides, and shall vex you in the land wherein yedwell. 

{33:56} Moreover it shall come to pass, [that] I shall do untoyou, as I thought to do unto them.   

{34:1} And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 

{34:2} Command thechildren of Israel, and say unto them, When ye come into the land ofCanaan; (this is the land that shall fall unto you for an inheritance,[even] the land of Canaan with the coasts thereof:) 

{34:3} Then yoursouth quarter shall be from the wilderness of Zin along by the coast ofEdom, and your south border shall be the outmost coast of the salt seaeastward: 

{34:4} And your border shall turn from the south to theascent of Akrabbim, and pass on to Zin: and the going forth thereofshall be from the south to Kadesh-barnea, and shall go on toHazar-addar, and pass on to Azmon: 

{34:5} And the border shall fetch acompass from Azmon unto the river of Egypt, and the goings out of itshall be at the sea. 

{34:6} And [as for] the western border, ye shalleven have the great sea for a border: this shall be your west border.

{34:7} And this shall be your north border: from the great sea ye shallpoint out for you mount Hor: 

{34:8} From mount Hor ye shall point out[your border] unto the entrance of Hamath; and the goings forth of theborder shall be to Zedad:   

{34:9} And the border shall go on to Ziphron, and the goings out ofit shall be at Hazar- enan: this shall be your north border. 

{34:10}And ye shall point out your east border from Hazar-enan to Shepham:

{34:11} And the coast shall go down from Shepham to Riblah, on the eastside of Ain; and the border shall descend, and shall reach unto theside of the sea of Chinnereth eastward: 

{34:12} And the border shall godown to Jordan, and the goings out of it shall be at the salt sea: thisshall be your land with the coasts thereof round about. 

{34:13} AndMoses commanded the children of Israel, saying, This [is] the landwhich ye shall inherit by lot, which the LORD commanded to give untothe nine tribes, and to the half tribe: 

{34:14} For the tribe of thechildren of Reuben according to the house of their fathers, and thetribe of the children of Gad according to the house of their fathers,have received [their inheritance;] and half the tribe of Manasseh havereceived their inheritance: 

{34:15} The two tribes and the half tribehave received their inheritance on this side Jordan [near] Jerichoeastward, toward the sunrising. 

{34:16} And the LORD spake unto Moses,saying, 

{34:17} These [are] the names of the men which shall divide theland unto you: Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun. 

{34:18}And ye shall take one prince of every tribe, to divide the land byinheritance. 

{34:19} And the names of the men [are] these: Of the tribeof Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh. 

{34:20} And of the tribe of thechildren of Simeon, Shemuel the son of Ammihud. 

{34:21} Of the tribe ofBenjamin, Elidad the son of Chislon. 

{34:22} And the prince of thetribe of the children of Dan, Bukki the son of Jogli. 

{34:23} Theprince of the children of Joseph, for the tribe of the children ofManasseh, Hanniel the son of Ephod. 

{34:24} And the prince of the tribeof the children of Ephraim, Kemuel the son of Shiphtan.

{34:27} And the prince of the tribeof the children of Asher, Ahihud the son of Shelomi. 

{34:28} And theprince of the tribe of the children of Naphtali, Pedahel the son ofAmmihud. 

{34:29} These [are they] whom the LORD commanded to divide theinheritance unto the children of Israel in the land of Canaan.   

{35:1} And the LORD spake unto Moses in the plains of Moab by Jordan[near] Jericho, saying, 

{35:2} Command the children of Israel, thatthey give unto the Levites of the inheritance of their possessioncities to dwell in; and ye shall give [also] unto the Levites suburbsfor the cities round about them. 

{35:3} And the cities shall they haveto dwell in; and the suburbs of them shall be for their cattle, and fortheir goods, and for all their beasts. 

{35:4} And the suburbs of thecities, which ye shall give unto the Levites, [shall reach] from thewall of the city and outward a thousand cubits round about. 

{35:5} Andye shall measure from without the city on the east side two thousandcubits, and on the south side two thousand cubits, and on the west sidetwo thousand cubits, and on the north side two thousand cubits and thecity [shall be] in the midst: this shall be to them the suburbs of thecities. 

{35:6} And among the cities which ye shall give unto theLevites [there shall be] six cities for refuge, which ye shall appointfor the manslayer, that he may flee thither: and to them ye shall addforty and two cities. 

{35:7} [So] all the cities which ye shall give tothe Levites [shall be] forty and eight cities: them [shall ye give]with their suburbs. 

{35:8} And the cities which ye shall give [shallbe] of the possession of the children of Israel: from [them that have]many ye shall give many; but from [them that have] few ye shall givefew: every one shall give of his cities unto the Levites according tohis inheritance which he inheriteth.   

{35:9} And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 

{35:10} Speak unto thechildren of Israel, and say unto them, When ye be come over Jordan intothe land of Canaan; 

{35:11} Then ye shall appoint you cities to becities of refuge for you; that the slayer may flee thither, whichkilleth any person at unawares. 

{35:12} And they shall be unto youcities for refuge from the avenger; that the manslayer die not, untilhe stand before the congregation in judgment. 

{35:13} And of thesecities which ye shall give six cities shall ye have for refuge. 

{35:14}Ye shall give three cities on this side Jordan, and three cities shallye give in the land of Canaan, [which] shall be cities of refuge.

{35:15} These six cities shall be a refuge, [both] for the children ofIsrael, and for the stranger, and for the sojourner among them: thatevery one that killeth any person unawares may flee thither. 

{35:16}And if he smite him with an instrument of iron, so that he die, he [is]a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death. 

{35:17} And ifhe smite him with throwing a stone, wherewith he may die, and he die,he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death. 

{35:18} Or[if] he smite him with an hand weapon of wood, wherewith he may die,and he die, he [is] a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put todeath. 

{35:19} The revenger of blood himself shall slay the murderer:when he meeteth him, he shall slay him. 

{35:20} But if he thrust him ofhatred, or hurl at him by laying of wait, that he die; 

{35:21} Or inenmity smite him with his hand, that he die: he that smote [him] shallsurely be put to death; [for] he [is] a murderer: the revenger of bloodshall slay the murderer, when he meeteth him. 

{35:22} But if he thrusthim suddenly without enmity, or have cast upon him any thing withoutlaying of wait, 

{35:23} Or with any stone, wherewith a man may die,seeing [him] not, and cast [it] upon him, that he die, and [was] nothis enemy, neither sought his harm: 

{35:24} Then the congregation shalljudge between the slayer and the revenger of blood according to thesejudgments: 

{35:25} And the congregation shall deliver the slayer out ofthe hand of the revenger of blood, and the congregation shall restorehim to the city of his refuge, whither he was fled: and he shall abidein it unto the death of the high priest, which was anointed with theholy oil. 

{35:26} But if the slayer shall at any time come without theborder of the city of his refuge, whither he was fled; 

{35:27} And therevenger of blood find him without the borders of the city of hisrefuge, and the revenger of blood kill the slayer; he shall not beguilty of blood: 

{35:28} Because he should have remained in the city ofhis refuge until the death of the high priest: but after the death ofthe high priest the slayer shall return into the land of hispossession. 

{35:29} So these [things] shall be for a statute ofjudgment unto you throughout your generations in all your dwellings.

{35:30} Whoso killeth any person, the murderer shall be put to death bythe mouth of witnesses: but one witness shall not testify against anyperson [to cause him] to die. 

{35:31} Moreover ye shall take nosatisfaction for the life of a murderer, which [is] guilty of death:but he shall be surely put to death. 

{35:32} And ye shall take nosatisfaction for him that is fled to the city of his refuge, that heshould come again to dwell in the land, until the death of the priest.

{35:33} So ye shall not pollute the land wherein ye [are:] for blood itdefileth the land: and the land cannot be cleansed of the blood that isshed therein, but by the blood of him that shed it. 

{35:34} Defile nottherefore the land which ye shall inhabit, wherein I dwell: for I theLORD dwell among the children of Israel.   

{36:1} And the chief fathers of the families of the children ofGilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the families of thesons of Joseph, came near, and spake before Moses, and before theprinces, the chief fathers of the children of Israel: 

{36:2} And theysaid, The LORD commanded my lord to give the land for an inheritance bylot to the children of Israel: and my lord was commanded by the LORD togive the inheritance of Zelophehad our brother unto his daughters.

{36:3} And if they be married to any of the sons of the [other] tribesof the children of Israel, then shall their inheritance be taken fromthe inheritance of our fathers, and shall be put to the inheritance ofthe tribe whereunto they are received: so shall it be taken from thelot of our inheritance. 

{36:4} And when the jubile of the children ofIsrael shall be, then shall their inheritance be put unto theinheritance of the tribe whereunto they are received: so shall theirinheritance be taken away from the inheritance of the tribe of ourfathers. 

{36:5} And Moses commanded the children of Israel according tothe word of the LORD, saying, The tribe of the sons of Joseph hath saidwell. 

{36:6} This is the thing which the LORD doth command concerningthe daughters of Zelophehad, saying, Let them marry to whom they thinkbest; only to the family of the tribe of their father shall they marry.

{36:7} So shall not the inheritance of the children of Israel removefrom tribe to tribe: for every one of the children of Israel shall keephimself to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers. 

{36:8} Andevery daughter, that possesseth an inheritance in any tribe of thechildren of Israel, shall be wife unto one of the family of the tribeof her father, that the children of Israel may enjoy every man theinheritance of his fathers. 

{36:9} Neither shall the inheritance removefrom [one] tribe to another tribe; but every one of the tribes of thechildren of Israel shall keep himself to his own inheritance. 

{36:10}Even as the LORD commanded Moses, so did the daughters of Zelophehad:

{36:11} For Mahlah, Tirzah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Noah, thedaughters of Zelophehad, were married unto their father's brothers'sons: 

{36:12} [And] they were married into the families of the sons ofManasseh the son of Joseph, and their inheritance remained in the tribeof the family of their father. 

{36:13} These [are] the commandments andthe judgments, which the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses unto thechildren of Israel in the plains of Moab by Jordan [near] Jericho.
