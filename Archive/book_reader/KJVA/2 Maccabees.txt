{The Second Book of the Maccabees   

{1:1} The brethren, the Jews that be at Jerusalem and in the land ofJudea, wish unto the brethren, the Jews that are throughout Egypthealth and peace:   

{1:2} God be gracious unto you, and remember his covenant that hemade with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, his faithful servants;   

{1:3} And give you all an heart to serve him, and to do his will,with a good courage and a willing mind;   

{1:4} And open your hearts in his law and commandments, and send youpeace,   

{1:5} And hear your prayers, and be at one with you, and neverforsake you in time of trouble.   

{1:6} And now we be here praying for you.   

{1:7} What time as Demetrius reigned, in the hundred threescore andninth year, we the Jews wrote unto you in the extremity of trouble thatcame upon us in those years, from the time that Jason and his companyrevolted from the holy land and kingdom,   

{1:8} And burned the porch, and shed innocent blood: then we prayedunto the Lord, and were heard; we offered also sacrifices and fineflour, and lighted the lamps, and set forth the loaves.   

{1:9} And now see that ye keep the feast of tabernacles in the monthCasleu.   

{1:10} In the hundred fourscore and eighth year, the people thatwere at Jerusalem and in Judea, and the council, and Judas, sentgreeting and health unto Aristobulus, king Ptolemeus' master, who wasof the stock of the anointed priests, and to the Jews that were inEgypt:   

{1:11} Insomuch as God hath delivered us from great perils, we thankhim highly, as having been in battle against a king.   

{1:12} For he cast them out that fought within the holy city.   

{1:13} For when the leader was come into Persia, and the army withhim that seemed invincible, they were slain in the temple of Nanea bythe deceit of Nanea's priests.   

{1:14} For Antiochus, as though he would marry her, came into theplace, and his friends that were with him, to receive money in name ofa dowry.   

{1:15} Which when the priests of Nanea had set forth, and he wasentered with a small company into the compass of the temple, they shutthe temple as soon as Antiochus was come in:   

{1:16} And opening a privy door of the roof, they threw stones likethunderbolts, and struck down the captain, hewed them in pieces, smoteoff their heads and cast them to those that were without.   

{1:17} Blessed be our God in all things, who hath delivered up theungodly.   

{1:18} Therefore whereas we are now purposed to keep thepurification of the temple upon the five and twentieth day of the monthCasleu, we thought it necessary to certify you thereof, that ye alsomight keep it, as the feast of the tabernacles, and of the fire, whichwas given us when Neemias offered sacrifice, after that he had buildedthe temple and the altar.   

{1:19} For when our fathers were led into Persia, the priests thatwere then devout took the fire of the altar privily, and hid it in anhollow place of a pit without water, where they kept it sure, so thatthe place was unknown to all men.   

{1:20} Now after many years, when it pleased God, Neemias, beingsent from the king of Persia, did send of the posterity of thosepriests that had hid it to the fire: but when they told us they foundno fire, but thick water;   

{1:21} Then commanded he them to draw it up, and to bring it; andwhen the sacrifices were laid on, Neemias commanded the priests tosprinkle the wood and the things laid thereupon with the water.   

{1:22} When this was done, and the time came that the sun shone,which afore was hid in the cloud, there was a great fire kindled, sothat every man marvelled.   

{1:23} And the priests made a prayer whilst the sacrifice wasconsuming, I say, both the priests, and all the rest, Jonathanbeginning, and the rest answering thereunto, as Neemias did.   

{1:24} And the prayer was after this manner; O Lord, Lord God,Creator of all things, who art fearful and strong, and righteous, andmerciful, and the only and gracious King,   

{1:25} The only giver of all things, the only just, almighty, andeverlasting, thou that deliverest Israel from all trouble, and didstchoose the fathers, and sanctify them:   

{1:26} Receive the sacrifice for thy whole people Israel, andpreserve thine own portion, and sanctify it.   

{1:27} Gather those together that are scattered from us, deliverthem that serve among the heathen, look upon them that are despised andabhorred, and let the heathen know that thou art our God.   

{1:28} Punish them that oppress us, and with pride do us wrong.   

{1:29} Plant thy people again in thy holy place, as Moses hathspoken.   

{1:30} And the priests sung psalms of thanksgiving.   

{1:31} Now when the sacrifice was consumed, Neemias commanded thewater that was left to be poured on the great stones.   

{1:32} When this was done, there was kindled a flame: but it wasconsumed by the light that shined from the altar.   

{1:33} So when this matter was known, it was told the king ofPersia, that in the place, where the priests that were led away had hidthe fire, there appeared water, and that Neemias had purified thesacrifices therewith.   

{1:34} Then the king, inclosing the place, made it holy, after hehad tried the matter.   

{1:35} And the king took many gifts, and bestowed thereof on thosewhom he would gratify.   

{1:36} And Neemias called this thing Naphthar, which is as much asto say, a cleansing: but many men call it Nephi.   

{2:1} It is also found in the records, that Jeremy the prophetcommanded them that were carried away to take of the fire, as it hathbeen signified:   

{2:2} And how that the prophet, having given them the law, chargedthem not to forget the commandments of the Lord, and that they shouldnot err in their minds, when they see images of silver and gold, withtheir ornaments.   

{2:3} And with other such speeches exhorted he them, that the lawshould not depart from their hearts.   

{2:4} It was also contained in the same writing, that the prophet,being warned of God, commanded the tabernacle and the ark to go withhim, as he went forth into the mountain, where Moses climbed up, andsaw the heritage of God.   

{2:5} And when Jeremy came thither, he found an hollow cave, whereinhe laid the tabernacle, and the ark, and the altar of incense, and sostopped the door.   

{2:6} And some of those that followed him came to mark the way, butthey could not find it.   

{2:7} Which when Jeremy perceived, he blamed them, saying, As forthat place, it shall be unknown until the time that God gather hispeople again together, and receive them unto mercy.   

{2:8} Then shall the Lord shew them these things, and the glory ofthe Lord shall appear, and the cloud also, as it was shewed underMoses, and as when Solomon desired that the place might be honourablysanctified.   

{2:9} It was also declared, that he being wise offered the sacrificeof dedication, and of the finishing of the temple.   

{2:10} And as when Moses prayed unto the Lord, the fire came downfrom heaven, and consumed the sacrifices: even so prayed Solomon also,and the fire came down from heaven, and consumed the burnt offerings.   

{2:11} And Moses said, Because the sin offering was not to be eaten,it was consumed.   

{2:12} So Solomon kept those eight days.   

{2:13} The same things also were reported in the writings andcommentaries of Neemias; and how he founding a library gatheredtogether the acts of the kings, and the prophets, and of David, and theepistles of the kings concerning the holy gifts.   

{2:14} In like manner also Judas gathered together all those thingsthat were lost by reason of the war we had, and they remain with us,   

{2:15} Wherefore if ye have need thereof, send some to fetch themunto you.   

{2:16} Whereas we then are about to celebrate the purification, wehave written unto you, and ye shall do well, if ye keep the same days.   

{2:17} We hope also, that the God, that delivered all his people,and gave them all an heritage, and the kingdom, and the priesthood, andthe sanctuary,   

{2:18} As he promised in the law, will shortly have mercy upon us,and gather us together out of every land under heaven into the holyplace: for he hath delivered us out of great troubles, and hathpurified the place.   

{2:19} Now as concerning Judas Maccabeus, and his brethren, and thepurification of the great temple, and the dedication of the altar,   

{2:20} And the wars against Antiochus Epiphanes, and Eupator his son,   

{2:21} And the manifest signs that came from heaven unto those thatbehaved themselves manfully to their honour for Judaism: so that, beingbut a few, they overcame the whole country, and chased barbarousmultitudes,   

{2:22} And recovered again the temple renowned all the world over,and freed the city, and upheld the laws which were going down, the Lordbeing gracious unto them with all favour:   

{2:23} All these things, I say, being declared by Jason of Cyrene infive books, we will assay to abridge in one volume.   

{2:24} For considering the infinite number, and the difficulty whichthey find that desire to look into the narrations of the story, for thevariety of the matter,   

{2:25} We have been careful, that they that will read may havedelight, and that they that are desirous to commit to memory might haveease, and that all into whose hands it comes might have profit.   

{2:26} Therefore to us, that have taken upon us this painful labourof abridging, it was not easy, but a matter of sweat and watching;   

{2:27} Even as it is no ease unto him that prepareth a banquet, andseeketh the benefit of others: yet for the pleasuring of many we willundertake gladly this great pains;   

{2:28} Leaving to the author the exact handling of every particular,and labouring to follow the rules of an abridgement.   

{2:29} For as the master builder of a new house must care for thewhole building; but he that undertaketh to set it out, and paint it,must seek out fit things for the adorning thereof: even so I think itis with us.   

{2:30} To stand upon every point, and go over things at large, andto be curious in particulars, belongeth to the first author of thestory:   

{2:31} But to use brevity, and avoid much labouring of the work, isto be granted to him that will make an abridgment.   

{2:32} Here then will we begin the story: only adding thus much tothat which hath been said, that it is a foolish thing to make a longprologue, and to be short in the story itself.   

{3:1} Now when the holy city was inhabited with all peace, and thelaws were kept very well, because of the godliness of Onias the highpriest, and his hatred of wickedness,   

{3:2} It came to pass that even the kings themselves did honour theplace, and magnify the temple with their best gifts;   

{3:3} Insomuch that Seleucus of Asia of his own revenues bare allthe costs belonging to the service of the sacrifices.   

{3:4} But one Simon of the tribe of Benjamin, who was made governorof the temple, fell out with the high priest about disorder in the city.   

{3:5} And when he could not overcome Onias, he gat him to Apolloniusthe son of Thraseas, who then was governor of Celosyria and Phenice,   

{3:6} And told him that the treasury in Jerusalem was full ofinfinite sums of money, so that the multitude of their riches, whichdid not pertain to the account of the sacrifices, was innumerable, andthat it was possible to bring all into the king's hand.   

{3:7} Now when Apollonius came to the king, and had shewed him ofthe money whereof he was told, the king chose out Heliodorus histreasurer, and sent him with a commandment to bring him the foresaidmoney.   

{3:8} So forthwith Heliodorus took his journey; under a colour ofvisiting the cities of Celosyria and Phenice, but indeed to fulfil theking's purpose.   

{3:9} And when he was come to Jerusalem, and had been courteouslyreceived of the high priest of the city, he told him what intelligencewas given of the money, and declared wherefore he came, and asked ifthese things were so indeed.   

{3:10} Then the high priest told him that there was such money laidup for the relief of widows and fatherless children:   

{3:11} And that some of it belonged to Hircanus son of Tobias, a manof great dignity, and not as that wicked Simon had misinformed: the sumwhereof in all was four hundred talents of silver, and two hundred ofgold:   

{3:12} And that it was altogether impossible that such wrongs shouldbe done unto them, that had committed it to the holiness of the place,and to the majesty and inviolable sanctity of the temple, honoured overall the world.   

{3:13} But Heliodorus, because of the king's commandment given him,said, That in any wise it must be brought into the king's treasury.   

{3:14} So at the day which he appointed he entered in to order thismatter: wherefore there was no small agony throughout the whole city.   

{3:15} But the priests, prostrating themselves before the altar intheir priests' vestments, called unto heaven upon him that made a lawconcerning things given to he kept, that they should safely bepreserved for such as had committed them to be kept.   

{3:16} Then whoso had looked the high priest in the face, it wouldhave wounded his heart: for his countenance and the changing of hiscolour declared the inward agony of his mind.   

{3:17} For the man was so compassed with fear and horror of thebody, that it was manifest to them that looked upon him, what sorrow hehad now in his heart.   

{3:18} Others ran flocking out of their houses to the generalsupplication, because the place was like to come into contempt.   

{3:19} And the women, girt with sackcloth under their breasts,abounded in the streets, and the virgins that were kept in ran, some tothe gates, and some to the walls, and others looked out of the windows.   

{3:20} And all, holding their hands toward heaven, made supplication.   

{3:21} Then it would have pitied a man to see the falling down ofthe multitude of all sorts, and the fear of the high priest being insuch an agony.   

{3:22} They then called upon the Almighty Lord to keep the thingscommitted of trust safe and sure for those that had committed them.   

{3:23} Nevertheless Heliodorus executed that which was decreed.   

{3:24} Now as he was there present himself with his guard about thetreasury, the Lord of spirits, and the Prince of all power, caused agreat apparition, so that all that presumed to come in with him wereastonished at the power of God, and fainted, and were sore afraid.   

{3:25} For there appeared unto them an horse with a terrible riderupon him, and adorned with a very fair covering, and he ran fiercely,and smote at Heliodorus with his forefeet, and it seemed that he thatsat upon the horse had complete harness of gold.   

{3:26} Moreover two other young men appeared before him, notable instrength, excellent in beauty, and comely in apparel, who stood by himon either side; and scourged him continually, and gave him many sorestripes.   

{3:27} And Heliodorus fell suddenly unto the ground, and wascompassed with great darkness: but they that were with him took him up,and put him into a litter.   

{3:28} Thus him, that lately came with a great train and with allhis guard into the said treasury, they carried out, being unable tohelp himself with his weapons: and manifestly they acknowledged thepower of God.   

{3:29} For he by the hand of God was cast down, and lay speechlesswithout all hope of life.   

{3:30} But they praised the Lord, that had miraculously honoured hisown place: for the temple; which a little afore was full of fear andtrouble, when the Almighty Lord appeared, was filled with joy andgladness.   

{3:31} Then straightways certain of Heliodorus' friends prayedOnias, that he would call upon the most High to grant him his life, wholay ready to give up the ghost.   

{3:32} So the high priest, suspecting lest the king shouldmisconceive that some treachery had been done to Heliodorus by theJews, offered a sacrifice for the health of the man.   

{3:33} Now as the high priest was making an atonement, the sameyoung men in the same clothing appeared and stood beside Heliodorus,saying, Give Onias the high priest great thanks, insomuch as for hissake the Lord hath granted thee life:   

{3:34} And seeing that thou hast been scourged from heaven, declareunto all men the mighty power of God. And when they had spoken thesewords, they appeared no more.   

{3:35} So Heliodorus, after he had offered sacrifice unto the Lord,and made great vows unto him that had saved his life, and salutedOnias, returned with his host to the king.   

{3:36} Then testified he to all men the works of the great God,which he had seen with his eyes.   

{3:37} And when the king Heliodorus, who might be a fit man to besent yet once again to Jerusalem, he said,   

{3:38} If thou hast any enemy or traitor, send him thither, and thoushalt receive him well scourged, if he escape with his life: for inthat place, no doubt; there is an especial power of God.   

{3:39} For he that dwelleth in heaven hath his eye on that place,and defendeth it; and he beateth and destroyeth them that come to hurtit.   

{3:40} And the things concerning Heliodorus, and the keeping of thetreasury, fell out on this sort.   

{4:1} This Simon now, of whom we spake afore, having been a betrayerof the money, and of his country, slandered Onias, as if he haterrified Heliodorus, and been the worker of these evils.   

{4:2} Thus was he bold to call him a traitor, that had deserved wellof the city, and tendered his own nation, and was so zealous of thelaws.   

{4:3} But when their hatred went so far, that by one of Simon'sfaction murders were committed,   

{4:4} Onias seeing the danger of this contention, and thatApollonius, as being the governor of Celosyria and Phenice, did rage,and increase Simon's malice,   

{4:5} He went to the king, not to be an accuser of his countrymen,but seeking the good of all, both publick and private:   

{4:6} For he saw that it was impossible that the state shouldcontinue quiet, and Simon leave his folly, unless the king did lookthereunto.   

{4:7} But after the death of Seleucus, when Antiochus, calledEpiphanes, took the kingdom, Jason the brother of Onias labouredunderhand to be high priest,   

{4:8} Promising unto the king by intercession three hundred andthreescore talents of silver, and of another revenue eighty talents:   

{4:9} Beside this, he promised to assign an hundred and fifty more,if he might have licence to set him up a place for exercise, and forthe training up of youth in the fashions of the heathen, and to writethem of Jerusalem by the name of Antiochians.   

{4:10} Which when the king had granted, and he had gotten into hishand the rule he forthwith brought his own nation to Greekish fashion.   

{4:11} And the royal privileges granted of special favour to theJews by the means of John the father of Eupolemus, who went ambassadorto Rome for amity and aid, he took away; and putting down thegovernments which were according to the law, he brought up new customsagainst the law:   

{4:12} For he built gladly a place of exercise under the toweritself, and brought the chief young men under his subjection, and madethem wear a hat.   

{4:13} Now such was the height of Greek fashions, and increase ofheathenish manners, through the exceeding profaneness of Jason, thatungodly wretch, and no high priest;   

{4:14} That the priests had no courage to serve any more at thealtar, but despising the temple, and neglecting the sacrifices,hastened to be partakers of the unlawful allowance in the place ofexercise, after the game of Discus called them forth;   

{4:15} Not setting by the honours of their fathers, but liking theglory of the Grecians best of all.   

{4:16} By reason whereof sore calamity came upon them: for they hadthem to be their enemies and avengers, whose custom they followed soearnestly, and unto whom they desired to be like in all things.   

{4:17} For it is not a light thing to do wickedly against the lawsof God: but the time following shall declare these things.   

{4:18} Now when the game that was used every faith year was kept atTyrus, the king being present,   

{4:19} This ungracious Jason sent special messengers from Jerusalem,who were Antiochians, to carry three hundred drachms of silver to thesacrifice of Hercules, which even the bearers thereof thought fit notto bestow upon the sacrifice, because it was not convenient, but to bereserved for other charges.   

{4:20} This money then, in regard of the sender, was appointed toHercules' sacrifice; but because of the bearers thereof, it wasemployed to the making of gallies.   

{4:21} Now when Apollonius the son of Menestheus was sent into Egyptfor the coronation of king Ptolemeus Philometor, Antiochus,understanding him not to be well affected to his affairs, provided forhis own safety: whereupon he came to Joppa, and from thence toJerusalem:   

{4:22} Where he was honourably received of Jason, and of the city,and was brought in with torch alight, and with great shoutings: and soafterward went with his host unto Phenice.   

{4:23} Three years afterward Jason sent Menelaus, the aforesaidSimon's brother, to bear the money unto the king, and to put him inmind of certain necessary matters.   

{4:24} But he being brought to the presence of the king, when he hadmagnified him for the glorious appearance of his power, got thepriesthood to himself, offering more than Jason by three hundredtalents of silver.   

{4:25} So he came with the king's mandate, bringing nothing worthythe high priesthood, but having the fury of a cruel tyrant, and therage of a savage beast.   

{4:26} Then Jason, who had undermined his own brother, beingundermined by another, was compelled to flee into the country of theAmmonites.   

{4:27} So Menelaus got the principality: but as for the money thathe had promised unto the king, he took no good order for it, albeitSostratis the ruler of the castle required it:   

{4:28} For unto him appertained the gathering of the customs.Wherefore they were both called before the king.   

{4:29} Now Menelaus left his brother Lysimachus in his stead in thepriesthood; and Sostratus left Crates, who was governor of the Cyprians.   

{4:30} While those things were in doing, they of Tarsus and Mallosmade insurrection, because they were given to the king's concubine,called Antiochus.   

{4:31} Then came the king in all haste to appease matters, leavingAndronicus, a man in authority, for his deputy.   

{4:32} Now Menelaus, supposing that he had gotten a convenient time,stole certain vessels of gold out of the temple, and gave some of themto Andronicus, and some he sold into Tyrus and the cities round about.   

{4:33} Which when Onias knew of a surety, he reproved him, andwithdrew himself into a sanctuary at Daphne, that lieth by Antiochia.   

{4:34} Wherefore Menelaus, taking Andronicus apart, prayed, him toget Onias into his hands; who being persuaded thereunto, and coming toOnias in deceit, gave him his right hand with oaths; and though he weresuspected by him, yet persuaded he him to come forth of the sanctuary:whom forthwith he shut up without regard of justice.   

{4:35} For the which cause not only the Jews, but many also of othernations, took great indignation, and were much grieved for the unjustmurder of the man.   

{4:36} And when the king was come again from the places aboutCilicia, the Jews that were in the city, and certain of the Greeks thatabhorred the fact also, complained because Onias was slain withoutcause.   

{4:37} Therefore Antiochus was heartily sorry, and moved to pity,and wept, because of the sober and modest behaviour of him that wasdead.   

{4:38} And being kindled with anger, forthwith he took awayAndronicus his purple, and rent off his clothes, and leading himthrough the whole city unto that very place, where he had committedimpiety against Onias, there slew he the cursed murderer. Thus the Lordrewarded him his punishment, as he had deserved.   

{4:39} Now when many sacrileges had been committed in the city byLysimachus with the consent of Menelaus, and the fruit thereof wasspread abroad, the multitude gathered themselves together againstLysimachus, many vessels of gold being already carried away.   

{4:40} Whereupon the common people rising, and being filled withrage, Lysimachus armed about three thousand men, and began first tooffer violence; one Auranus being the leader, a man far gone in years,and no less in folly.   

{4:41} They then seeing the attempt of Lysimachus, some of themcaught stones, some clubs, others taking handfuls of dust, that wasnext at hand, cast them all together upon Lysimachus, and those thatset upon them.   

{4:42} Thus many of them they wounded, and some they struck to theground, and all of them they forced to flee: but as for thechurchrobber himself, him they killed beside the treasury.   

{4:43} Of these matters therefore there was an accusation laidagainst Menelaus.   

{4:44} Now when the king came to Tyrus, three men that were sentfrom the senate pleaded the cause before him:   

{4:45} But Menelaus, being now convicted, promised Ptolemee the sonof Dorymenes to give him much money, if he would pacify the king towardhim.   

{4:46} Whereupon Ptolemee taking the king aside into a certaingallery, as it were to take the air, brought him to be of another mind:   

{4:47} Insomuch that he discharged Menelaus from the accusations,who notwithstanding was cause of all the mischief: and those poor men,who, if they had told their cause, yea, before the Scythians, shouldhave been judged innocent, them he condemned to death.   

{4:48} Thus they that followed the matter for the city, and for thepeople, and for the holy vessels, did soon suffer unjust punishment.   

{4:49} Wherefore even they of Tyrus, moved with hatred of thatwicked deed, caused them to be honourably buried.   

{4:50} And so through the covetousness of them that were of powerMenelaus remained still in authority, increasing in malice, and being agreat traitor to the citizens.   

{5:1} About the same time Antiochus prepared his second voyage intoEgypt:   

{5:2} And then it happened, that through all the city, for the spacealmost of forty days, there were seen horsemen running in the air, incloth of gold, and armed with lances, like a band of soldiers,   

{5:3} And troops of horsemen in array, encountering and running oneagainst another, with shaking of shields, and multitude of pikes, anddrawing of swords, and casting of darts, and glittering of goldenornaments, and harness of all sorts.   

{5:4} Wherefore every man prayed that that apparition might turn togood.   

{5:5} Now when there was gone forth a false rumour, as thoughAntiochus had been dead, Jason took at the least a thousand men, andsuddenly made an assault upon the city; and they that were upon thewalls being put back, and the city at length taken, Menelaus fled intothe castle:   

{5:6} But Jason slew his own citizens without mercy, not consideringthat to get the day of them of his own nation would be a most unhappyday for him; but thinking they had been his enemies, and not hiscountrymen, whom he conquered.   

{5:7} Howbeit for all this he obtained not the principality, but atthe last received shame for the reward of his treason, and fled againinto the country of the Ammonites.   

{5:8} In the end therefore he had an unhappy return, being accusedbefore Aretas the king of the Arabians, fleeing from city to city,pursued of all men, hated as a forsaker of the laws, and being had inabomination as an open enemy of his country and countrymen, he was castout into Egypt.   

{5:9} Thus he that had driven many out of their country perished ina strange land, retiring to the Lacedemonians, and thinking there tofind succour by reason of his kindred:   

{5:10} And he that had cast out many unburied had none to mourn forhim, nor any solemn funerals at all, nor sepulchre with his fathers.   

{5:11} Now when this that was done came to the king's car, hethought that Judea had revolted: whereupon removing out of Egypt in afurious mind, he took the city by force of arms,   

{5:12} And commanded his men of war not to spare such as they met,and to slay such as went up upon the houses.   

{5:13} Thus there was killing of young and old, making away of men,women, and children, slaying of virgins and infants.   

{5:14} And there were destroyed within the space of three whole daysfourscore thousand, whereof forty thousand were slain in the conflict;and no fewer sold than slain.   

{5:15} Yet was he not content with this, but presumed to go into themost holy temple of all the world; Menelaus, that traitor to the laws,and to his own country, being his guide:   

{5:16} And taking the holy vessels with polluted hands, and withprofane hands pulling down the things that were dedicated by otherkings to the augmentation and glory and honour of the place, he gavethem away.   

{5:17} And so haughty was Antiochus in mind, that he considered notthat the Lord was angry for a while for the sins of them that dwelt inthe city, and therefore his eye was not upon the place.   

{5:18} For had they not been formerly wrapped in many sins, thisman, as soon as he had come, had forthwith been scourged, and put backfrom his presumption, as Heliodorus was, whom Seleucus the king sent toview the treasury.   

{5:19} Nevertheless God did not choose the people for the place'ssake, but the place far the people's sake.   

{5:20} And therefore the place itself, that was partaker with themof the adversity that happened to the nation, did afterward communicatein the benefits sent from the Lord: and as it was forsaken in the wrathof the Almighty, so again, the great Lord being reconciled, it was setup with all glory.   

{5:21} So when Antiochus had carried out of the temple a thousandand eight hundred talents, he departed in all haste unto Antiochia,weening in his pride to make the land navigable, and the sea passableby foot: such was the haughtiness of his mind.   

{5:22} And he left governors to vex the nation: at Jerusalem,Philip, for his country a Phrygian, and for manners more barbarous thanhe that set him there;   

{5:23} And at Garizim, Andronicus; and besides, Menelaus, who worsethan all the rest bare an heavy hand over the citizens, having amalicious mind against his countrymen the Jews.   

{5:24} He sent also that detestable ringleader Apollonius with anarmy of two and twenty thousand, commanding him to slay all those thatwere in their best age, and to sell the women and the younger sort:   

{5:25} Who coming to Jerusalem, and pretending peace, did forbeartill the holy day of the sabbath, when taking the Jews keeping holyday, he commanded his men to arm themselves.   

{5:26} And so he slew all them that were gone to the celebrating ofthe sabbath, and running through the city with weapons slew greatmultitudes.   

{5:27} But Judas Maccabeus with nine others, or thereabout, withdrewhimself into the wilderness, and lived in the mountains after themanner of beasts, with his company, who fed on herbs continually, lestthey should be partakers of the pollution.   

{6:1} Not long after this the king sent an old man of Athens tocompel the Jews to depart from the laws of their fathers, and not tolive after the laws of God:   

{6:2} And to pollute also the temple in Jerusalem, and to call itthe temple of Jupiter Olympius; and that in Garizim, of Jupiter theDefender of strangers, as they did desire that dwelt in the place.   

{6:3} The coming in of this mischief was sore and grievous to thepeople:   

{6:4} For the temple was filled with riot and revelling by theGentiles, who dallied with harlots, and had to do with women within thecircuit of the holy places, and besides that brought in things thatwere not lawful.   

{6:5} The altar also was filled with profane things, which the lawforbiddeth.   

{6:6} Neither was it lawful for a man to keep sabbath days orancient fasts, or to profess himself at all to be a Jew.   

{6:7} And in the day of the king's birth every month they werebrought by bitter constraint to eat of the sacrifices; and when thefast of Bacchus was kept, the Jews were compelled to go in processionto Bacchus, carrying ivy.   

{6:8} Moreover there went out a decree to the neighbour cities ofthe heathen, by the suggestion of Ptolemee, against the Jews, that theyshould observe the same fashions, and be partakers of their sacrifices:   

{6:9} And whoso would not conform themselves to the manners of theGentiles should be put to death. Then might a man have seen the presentmisery.   

{6:10} For there were two women brought, who had circumcised theirchildren; whom when they had openly led round about the city, the babeshanding at their breasts, they cast them down headlong from the wall.   

{6:11} And others, that had run together into caves near by, to keepthe sabbath day secretly, being discovered by Philip, were all burnttogether, because they made a conscience to help themselves for thehonour of the most sacred day.   

{6:12} Now I beseech those that read this book, that they be notdiscouraged for these calamities, but that they judge those punishmentsnot to be for destruction, but for a chastening of our nation.   

{6:13} For it is a token of his great goodness, when wicked doersare not suffered any long time, but forthwith punished.   

{6:14} For not as with other nations, whom the Lord patientlyforbeareth to punish, till they be come to the fulness of their sins,so dealeth he with us,   

{6:15} Lest that, being come to the height of sin, afterwards heshould take vengeance of us.   

{6:16} And therefore he never withdraweth his mercy from us: andthough he punish with adversity, yet doth he never forsake his people.   

{6:17} But let this that we at spoken be for a warning unto us. Andnow will we come to the declaring of the matter in a few words.   

{6:18} Eleazar, one of the principal scribes, an aged man, and of awell favoured countenance, was constrained to open his mouth, and toeat swine's flesh.   

{6:19} But he, choosing rather to die gloriously, than to livestained with such an abomination, spit it forth, and came of his ownaccord to the torment,   

{6:20} As it behoved them to come, that are resolute to stand outagainst such things, as are not lawful for love of life to be tasted.   

{6:21} But they that had the charge of that wicked feast, for theold acquaintance they had with the man, taking him aside, besought himto bring flesh of his own provision, such as was lawful for him to use,and make as if he did eat of the flesh taken from the sacrificecommanded by the king;   

{6:22} That in so doing he might be delivered from death, and forthe old friendship with them find favour.   

{6:23} But he began to consider discreetly, and as became his age,and the excellency of his ancient years, and the honour of his grayhead, whereon was come, and his most honest education from a child, orrather the holy law made and given by God: therefore he answeredaccordingly, and willed them straightways to send him to the grave.   

{6:24} For it becometh not our age, said he, in any wise todissemble, whereby many young persons might think that Eleazar, beingfourscore years old and ten, were now gone to a strange religion;   

{6:25} And so they through mine hypocrisy, and desire to live alittle time and a moment longer, should be deceived by me, and I get astain to mine old age, and make it abominable.   

{6:26} For though for the present time I should be delivered fromthe punishment of men: yet should I not escape the hand of theAlmighty, neither alive, nor dead.   

{6:27} Wherefore now, manfully changing this life, I will shewmyself such an one as mine age requireth,   

{6:28} And leave a notable example to such as be young to diewillingly and courageously for the honourable and holy laws. And whenhe had said these words, immediately he went to the torment:   

{6:29} They that led him changing the good will they bare him alittle before into hatred, because the foresaid speeches proceeded, asthey thought, from a desperate mind.   

{6:30} But when he was ready to die with stripes, he groaned, andsaid, It is manifest unto the Lord, that hath the holy knowledge, thatwhereas I might have been delivered from death, I now endure sore painsin body by being beaten: but in soul am well content to suffer thesethings, because I fear him.   

{6:31} And thus this man died, leaving his death for an example of anoble courage, and a memorial of virtue, not only unto young men, butunto all his nation.   

{7:1} It came to pass also, that seven brethren with their motherwere taken, and compelled by the king against the law to taste swine'sflesh, and were tormented with scourges and whips.   

{7:2} But one of them that spake first said thus, What wouldest thouask or learn of us? we are ready to die, rather than to transgress thelaws of our fathers.   

{7:3} Then the king, being in a rage, commanded pans and caldrons tobe made hot:   

{7:4} Which forthwith being heated, he commanded to cut out thetongue of him that spake first, and to cut off the utmost parts of hisbody, the rest of his brethren and his mother looking on.   

{7:5} Now when he was thus maimed in all his members, he commandedhim being yet alive to be brought to the fire, and to be fried in thepan: and as the vapour of the pan was for a good space dispersed, theyexhorted one another with the mother to die manfully, saying thus,   

{7:6} The Lord God looketh upon us, and in truth hath comfort in us,as Moses in his song, which witnessed to their faces, declared, saying,And he shall be comforted in his servants.   

{7:7} So when the first was dead after this number, they brought thesecond to make him a mocking stock: and when they had pulled off theskin of his head with the hair, they asked him, Wilt thou eat, beforethou be punished throughout every member of thy body?   

{7:8} But he answered in his own language, and said, No. Whereforehe also received the next torment in order, as the former did.   

{7:9} And when he was at the last gasp, he said, Thou like a furytakest us out of this present life, but the King of the world shallraise us up, who have died for his laws, unto everlasting life.   

{7:10} After him was the third made a mocking stock: and when he wasrequired, he put out his tongue, and that right soon, holding forth hishands manfully.   

{7:11} And said courageously, These I had from heaven; and for hislaws I despise them; and from him I hope to receive them again.   

{7:12} Insomuch that the king, and they that were with him,marvelled at the young man's courage, for that he nothing regarded thepains.   

{7:13} Now when this man was dead also, they tormented and mangledthe fourth in like manner.   

{7:14} So when he was ready to die he said thus, It is good, beingput to death by men, to look for hope from God to be raised up again byhim: as for thee, thou shalt have no resurrection to life.   

{7:15} Afterward they brought the fifth also, and mangled him.   

{7:16} Then looked he unto the king, and said, Thou hast power overmen, thou art corruptible, thou doest what thou wilt; yet think notthat our nation is forsaken of God;   

{7:17} But abide a while, and behold his great power, how he willtorment thee and thy seed.   

{7:18} After him also they brought the sixth, who being ready to diesaid, Be not deceived without cause: for we suffer these things forourselves, having sinned against our God: therefore marvellous thingsare done unto us.   

{7:19} But think not thou, that takest in hand to strive againstGod, that thou shalt escape unpunished.   

{7:20} But the mother was marvellous above all, and worthy ofhonourable memory: for when she saw her seven sons slain within thespace of one day, she bare it with a good courage, because of the hopethat she had in the Lord.   

{7:21} Yea, she exhorted every one of them in her own language,filled with courageous spirits; and stirring up her womanish thoughtswith a manly stomach, she said unto them,   

{7:22} I cannot tell how ye came into my womb: for I neither gaveyou breath nor life, neither was it I that formed the members of everyone of you;   

{7:23} But doubtless the Creator of the world, who formed thegeneration of man, and found out the beginning of all things, will alsoof his own mercy give you breath and life again, as ye now regard notyour own selves for his laws' sake.   

{7:24} Now Antiochus, thinking himself despised, and suspecting itto be a reproachful speech, whilst the youngest was yet alive, did notonly exhort him by words, but also assured him with oaths, that hewould make him both a rich and a happy man, if he would turn from thelaws of his fathers; and that also he would take him for his friend,and trust him with affairs.   

{7:25} But when the young man would in no case hearken unto him, theking called his mother, and exhorted her that she would counsel theyoung man to save his life.   

{7:26} And when he had exhorted her with many words, she promisedhim that she would counsel her son.   

{7:27} But she bowing herself toward him, laughing the cruel tyrantto scorn, spake in her country language on this manner; O my son, havepity upon me that bare thee nine months in my womb, and gave thee suchthree years, and nourished thee, and brought thee up unto this age, andendured the troubles of education.   

{7:28} I beseech thee, my son, look upon the heaven and the earth,and all that is therein, and consider that God made them of things thatwere not; and so was mankind made likewise.   

{7:29} Fear not this tormentor, but, being worthy of thy brethren,take thy death that I may receive thee again in mercy with thy brethren.   

{7:30} Whiles she was yet speaking these words, the young man said,Whom wait ye for? I will not obey the king's commandment: but I willobey the commandment of the law that was given unto our fathers byMoses.   

{7:31} And thou, that hast been the author of all mischief againstthe Hebrews, shalt not escape the hands of God.   

{7:32} For we suffer because of our sins.   

{7:33} And though the living Lord be angry with us a little whilefor our chastening and correction, yet shall he be at one again withhis servants.   

{7:34} But thou, O godless man, and of all other most wicked, be notlifted up without a cause, nor puffed up with uncertain hopes, liftingup thy hand against the servants of God:   

{7:35} For thou hast not yet escaped the judgment of Almighty God,who seeth all things.   

{7:36} For our brethren, who now have suffered a short pain, aredead under God's covenant of everlasting life: but thou, through thejudgment of God, shalt receive just punishment for thy pride.   

{7:37} But I, as my brethren, offer up my body and life for the lawsof our fathers, beseeching God that he would speedily be merciful untoour nation; and that thou by torments and plagues mayest confess, thathe alone is God;   

{7:38} And that in me and my brethren the wrath of the Almighty,which is justly brought upon our nation, may cease.   

{7:39} Than the king' being in a rage, handed him worse than all therest, and took it grievously that he was mocked.   

{7:40} So this man died undefiled, and put his whole trust in theLord.   

{7:41} Last of all after the sons the mother died.   

{7:42} Let this be enough now to have spoken concerning theidolatrous feasts, and the extreme tortures.   

{8:1} Then Judas Maccabeus, and they that were with him, wentprivily into the towns, and called their kinsfolks together, and tookunto them all such as continued in the Jews' religion, and assembledabout six thousand men.   

{8:2} And they called upon the Lord, that he would look upon thepeople that was trodden down of all; and also pity the temple profanedof ungodly men;   

{8:3} And that he would have compassion upon the city, sore defaced,and ready to be made even with the ground; and hear the blood thatcried unto him,   

{8:4} And remember the wicked slaughter of harmless infants, and theblasphemies committed against his name; and that he would shew hishatred against the wicked.   

{8:5} Now when Maccabeus had his company about him, he could not bewithstood by the heathen: for the wrath of the Lord was turned intomercy.   

{8:6} Therefore he came at unawares, and burnt up towns and cities,and got into his hands the most commodious places, and overcame and putto flight no small number of his enemies.   

{8:7} But specially took he advantage of the night for such privyattempts, insomuch that the fruit of his holiness was spread everywhere.   

{8:8} So when Philip saw that this man increased by little andlittle, and that things prospered with him still more and more, hewrote unto Ptolemeus, the governor of Celosyria and Phenice, to yieldmore aid to the king's affairs.   

{8:9} Then forthwith choosing Nicanor the son of Patroclus, one ofhis special friends, he sent him with no fewer than twenty thousand ofall nations under him, to root out the whole generation of the Jews;and with him he joined also Gorgias a captain, who in matters of warhad great experience.   

{8:10} So Nicanor undertook to make so much money of the captiveJews, as should defray the tribute of two thousand talents, which theking was to pay to the Romans.   

{8:11} Wherefore immediately he sent to the cities upon the seacoast, proclaiming a sale of the captive Jews, and promising that theyshould have fourscore and ten bodies for one talent, not expecting thevengeance that was to follow upon him from the Almighty God.   

{8:12} Now when word was brought unto Judas of Nicanor's coming, andhe had imparted unto those that were with him that the army was at hand,   

{8:13} They that were fearful, and distrusted the justice of God,fled, and conveyed themselves away.   

{8:14} Others sold all that they had left, and withal besought theLord to deliver them, sold by the wicked Nicanor before they mettogether:   

{8:15} And if not for their own sakes, yet for the covenants he hadmade with their fathers, and for his holy and glorious name's sake, bywhich they were called.   

{8:16} So Maccabeus called his men together unto the number of sixthousand, and exhorted them not to be stricken with terror of theenemy, nor to fear the great multitude of the heathen, who came wronglyagainst them; but to fight manfully,   

{8:17} And to set before their eyes the injury that they hadunjustly done to the holy place, and the cruel handling of the city,whereof they made a mockery, and also the taking away of the governmentof their forefathers:   

{8:18} For they, said he, trust in their weapons and boldness; butour confidence is in the Almighty who at a beck can cast down both themthat come against us, and also all the world.   

{8:19} Moreover, he recounted unto them what helps their forefathershad found, and how they were delivered, when under Sennacherib anhundred fourscore and five thousand perished.   

{8:20} And he told them of the battle that they had in Babylon withthe Galatians, how they came but eight thousand in all to the business,with four thousand Macedonians, and that the Macedonians beingperplexed, the eight thousand destroyed an hundred and twenty thousandbecause of the help that they had from heaven, and so received a greatbooty.   

{8:21} Thus when he had made them bold with these words, and readyto die for the law and the country, he divided his army into four parts;   

{8:22} And joined with himself his own brethren, leaders of eachband, to wit Simon, and Joseph, and Jonathan, giving each one fifteenhundred men.   

{8:23} Also he appointed Eleazar to read the holy book: and when hehad given them this watchword, The help of God; himself leading thefirst band,   

{8:24} And by the help of the Almighty they slew above nine thousandof their enemies, and wounded and maimed the most part of Nicanor'shost, and so put all to flight;   

{8:25} And took their money that came to buy them, and pursued themfar: but lacking time they returned:   

{8:26} For it was the day before the sabbath, and therefore theywould no longer pursue them.   

{8:27} So when they had gathered their armour together, and spoiledtheir enemies, they occupied themselves about the sabbath, yieldingexceeding praise and thanks to the Lord, who had preserved them untothat day, which was the beginning of mercy distilling upon them.   

{8:28} And after the sabbath, when they had given part of the spoilsto the maimed, and the widows, and orphans, the residue they dividedamong themselves and their servants.   

{8:29} When this was done, and they had made a common supplication,they besought the merciful Lord to be reconciled with his servants forever.   

{8:30} Moreover of those that were with Timotheus and Bacchides, whofought against them, they slew above twenty thousand, and very easilygot high and strong holds, and divided among themselves many spoilsmore, and made the maimed, orphans, widows, yea, and the aged also,equal in spoils with themselves.   

{8:31} And when they had gathered their armour together, they laidthem up all carefully in convenient places, and the remnant of thespoils they brought to Jerusalem.   

{8:32} They slew also Philarches, that wicked person, who was withTimotheus, and had annoyed the Jews many ways.   

{8:33} Furthermore at such time as they kept the feast for thevictory in their country they burnt Callisthenes, that had set fireupon the holy gates, who had fled into a little house; and so hereceived a reward meet for his wickedness.   

{8:34} As for that most ungracious Nicanor, who had brought athousand merchants to buy the Jews,   

{8:35} He was through the help of the Lord brought down by them, ofwhom he made least account; and putting off his glorious apparel, anddischarging his company, he came like a fugitive servant through themidland unto Antioch having very great dishonour, for that his host wasdestroyed.   

{8:36} Thus he, that took upon him to make good to the Romans theirtribute by means of captives in Jerusalem, told abroad, that the Jewshad God to fight for them, and therefore they could not be hurt,because they followed the laws that he gave them.   

{9:1} About that time came Antiochus with dishonour out of thecountry of Persia   

{9:2} For he had entered the city called Persepolis, and went aboutto rob the temple, and to hold the city; whereupon the multituderunning to defend themselves with their weapons put them to flight; andso it happened, that Antiochus being put to flight of the inhabitantsreturned with shame.   

{9:3} Now when he came to Ecbatane, news was brought him what hadhappened unto Nicanor and Timotheus.   

{9:4} Then swelling with anger. he thought to avenge upon the Jewsthe disgrace done unto him by those that made him flee. Thereforecommanded he his chariotman to drive without ceasing, and to dispatchthe journey, the judgment of God now following him. For he had spokenproudly in this sort, That he would come to Jerusalem and make it acommon burying place of the Jews.   

{9:5} But the Lord Almighty, the God of Isreal, smote him with anincurable and invisible plague: or as soon as he had spoken thesewords, a pain of the bowels that was remediless came upon him, and soretorments of the inner parts;   

{9:6} And that most justly: for he had tormented other men's bowelswith many and strange torments.   

{9:7} Howbeit he nothing at all ceased from his bragging, but stillwas filled with pride, breathing out fire in his rage against the Jews,and commanding to haste the journey: but it came to pass that he felldown from his chariot, carried violently; so that having a sore fall,all the members of his body were much pained.   

{9:8} And thus he that a little afore thought he might command thewaves of the sea, (so proud was he beyond the condition of man) andweigh the high mountains in a balance, was now cast on the ground, andcarried in an horselitter, shewing forth unto all the manifest power ofGod.   

{9:9} So that the worms rose up out of the body of this wicked man,and whiles he lived in sorrow and pain, his flesh fell away, and thefilthiness of his smell was noisome to all his army.   

{9:10} And the man, that thought a little afore he could reach tothe stars of heaven, no man could endure to carry for his intolerablestink.   

{9:11} Here therefore, being plagued, he began to leave off hisgreat pride, and to come to the knowledge of himself by the scourge ofGod, his pain increasing every moment.   

{9:12} And when he himself could not abide his own smell, he saidthese words, It is meet to be subject unto God, and that a man that ismortal should not proudly think of himself if he were God.   

{9:13} This wicked person vowed also unto the Lord, who now no morewould have mercy upon him, saying thus,   

{9:14} That the holy city (to the which he was going in haste to layit even with the ground, and to make it a common buryingplace,) hewould set at liberty:   

{9:15} And as touching the Jews, whom he had judged not worthy somuch as to be buried, but to be cast out with their children to bedevoured of the fowls and wild beasts, he would make them all equals tothe citizens of Athens:   

{9:16} And the holy temple, which before he had spoiled, he wouldgarnish with goodly gifts, and restore all the holy vessels with manymore, and out of his own revenue defray the charges belonging to thesacrifices:   

{9:17} Yea, and that also he would become a Jew himself, and gothrough all the world that was inhabited, and declare the power of God.   

{9:18} But for all this his pains would not cease: for the justjudgment of God was come upon him: therefore despairing of his health,he wrote unto the Jews the letter underwritten, containing the form ofa supplication, after this manner:   

{9:19} Antiochus, king and governor, to the good Jews his citizenswisheth much joy, health, and prosperity:   

{9:20} If ye and your children fare well, and your affairs be toyour contentment, I give very great thanks to God, having my hope inheaven.   

{9:21} As for me, I was weak, or else I would have remembered kindlyyour honour and good will returning out of Persia, and being taken witha grievous disease, I thought it necessary to care for the commonsafety of all:   

{9:22} Not distrusting mine health, but having great hope to escapethis sickness.   

{9:23} But considering that even my father, at what time he led anarmy into the high countries. appointed a successor,   

{9:24} To the end that, if any thing fell out contrary toexpectation, or if any tidings were brought that were grievous, they ofthe land, knowing to whom the state was left, might not be troubled:   

{9:25} Again, considering how that the princes that are borderersand neighbours unto my kingdom wait for opportunities, and expect whatshall be the event. I have appointed my son Antiochus king, whom Ioften committed and commended unto many of you, when I went up into thehigh provinces; to whom I have written as followeth:   

{9:26} Therefore I pray and request you to remember the benefitsthat I have done unto you generally, and in special, and that every manwill be still faithful to me and my son.   

{9:27} For I am persuaded that he understanding my mind willfavourably and graciously yield to your desires.   

{9:28} Thus the murderer and blasphemer having suffered mostgrievously, as he entreated other men, so died he a miserable death ina strange country in the mountains.   

{9:29} And Philip, that was brought up with him, carried away hisbody, who also fearing the son of Antiochus went into Egypt toPtolemeus Philometor.   

{10:1} Now Maccabeus and his company, the Lord guiding them,recovered the temple and the city:   

{10:2} But the altars which the heathen had built in the openstreet, and also the chapels, they pulled down.   

{10:3} And having cleansed the temple they made another altar, andstriking stones they took fire out of them, and offered a sacrificeafter two years, and set forth incense, and lights, and shewbread.   

{10:4} When that was done, they fell flat down, and besought theLord that they might come no more into such troubles; but if theysinned any more against him, that he himself would chasten them withmercy, and that they might not be delivered unto the blasphemous andbarbarous nations.   

{10:5} Now upon the same day that the strangers profaned the temple,on the very same day it was cleansed again, even the five and twentiethday of the same month, which is Casleu.   

{10:6} And they kept the eight days with gladness, as in the feastof the tabernacles, remembering that not long afore they had held thefeast of the tabernacles, when as they wandered in the mountains anddens like beasts.   

{10:7} Therefore they bare branches, and fair boughs, and palmsalso, and sang psalms unto him that had given them good success incleansing his place.   

{10:8} They ordained also by a common statute and decree, That everyyear those days should be kept of the whole nation of the Jews.   

{10:9} And this was the end of Antiochus, called Epiphanes.   

{10:10} Now will we declare the acts of Antiochus Eupator, who wasthe son of this wicked man, gathering briefly the calamities of thewars.   

{10:11} So when he was come to the crown, he set one Lysias over theaffairs of his realm, and appointed him his chief governor of Celosyriaand Phenice.   

{10:12} For Ptolemeus, that was called Macron, choosing rather to dojustice unto the Jews for the wrong that had been done unto them,endeavoured to continue peace with them.   

{10:13} Whereupon being accused of the king's friends beforeEupator, and called traitor at every word because he had left Cyprus,that Philometor had committed unto him, and departed to AntiochusEpiphanes, and seeing that he was in no honourable place, he was sodiscouraged, that he poisoned himself and died.   

{10:14} But when Gorgias was governor of the holds, he hiredsoldiers, and nourished war continually with the Jews:   

{10:15} And therewithall the Idumeans, having gotten into theirhands the most commodious holds, kept the Jews occupied, and receivingthose that were banished from Jerusalem, they went about to nourish war.   

{10:16} Then they that were with Maccabeus made supplication, andbesought God that he would be their helper; and so they ran withviolence upon the strong holds of the Idumeans,   

{10:17} And assaulting them strongly, they won the holds, and keptoff all that fought upon the wall, and slew all that fell into theirhands, and killed no fewer than twenty thousand.   

{10:18} And because certain, who were no less than nine thousand,were fled together into two very strong castles, having all manner ofthings convenient to sustain the siege,   

{10:19} Maccabeus left Simon and Joseph, and Zaccheus also, and themthat were with him, who were enough to besiege them, and departedhimself unto those places which more needed his help.   

{10:20} Now they that were with Simon, being led with covetousness,were persuaded for money through certain of those that were in thecastle, and took seventy thousand drachms, and let some of them escape.   

{10:21} But when it was told Maccabeus what was done, he called thegovernors of the people together, and accused those men, that they hadsold their brethren for money, and set their enemies free to fightagainst them.   

{10:22} So he slew those that were found traitors, and immediatelytook the two castles.   

{10:23} And having good success with his weapons in all things hetook in hand, he slew in the two holds more than twenty thousand.   

{10:24} Now Timotheus, whom the Jews had overcome before, when hehad gathered a great multitude of foreign forces, and horses out ofAsia not a few, came as though he would take Jewry by force of arms.   

{10:25} But when he drew near, they that were with Maccabeus turnedthemselves to pray unto God, and sprinkled earth upon their heads, andgirded their loins with sackcloth,   

{10:26} And fell down at the foot of the altar, and besought him tobe merciful to them, and to be an enemy to their enemies, and anadversary to their adversaries, as the law declareth.   

{10:27} So after the prayer they took their weapons, and went onfurther from the city: and when they drew near to their enemies, theykept by themselves.   

{10:28} Now the sun being newly risen, they joined both together;the one part having together with their virtue their refuge also untothe Lord for a pledge of their success and victory: the other sidemaking their rage leader of their battle   

{10:29} But when the battle waxed strong, there appeared unto theenemies from heaven five comely men upon horses, with bridles of gold,and two of them led the Jews,   

{10:30} And took Maccabeus betwixt them, and covered him on everyside weapons, and kept him safe, but shot arrows and lightnings againstthe enemies: so that being confounded with blindness, and full oftrouble, they were killed.   

{10:31} And there were slain of footmen twenty thousand and fivehundred, and six hundred horsemen.   

{10:32} As for Timotheus himself, he fled into a very strong hold,called Gawra, where Chereas was governor.   

{10:33} But they that were with Maccabeus laid siege against thefortress courageously four days.   

{10:34} And they that were within, trusting to the strength of theplace, blasphemed exceedingly, and uttered wicked words.   

{10:35} Nevertheless upon the fifth day early twenty young men ofMaccabeus' company, inflamed with anger because of the blasphemies,assaulted the wall manly, and with a fierce courage killed all thatthey met withal.   

{10:36} Others likewise ascending after them, whiles they werebusied with them that were within, burnt the towers, and kindling firesburnt the blasphemers alive; and others broke open the gates, and,having received in the rest of the army, took the city,   

{10:37} And killed Timotheus, that was hid in a certain pit, andChereas his brother, with Apollophanes.   

{10:38} When this was done, they praised the Lord with psalms andthanksgiving, who had done so great things for Israel, and given themthe victory.   

{11:1} Not long after the, Lysias the king's protector and cousin,who also managed the affairs, took sore displeasure for the things thatwere done.   

{11:2} And when he had gathered about fourscore thousand with allthe horsemen, he came against the Jews, thinking to make the city anhabitation of the Gentiles,   

{11:3} And to make a gain of the temple, as of the other chapels ofthe heathen, and to set the high priesthood to sale every year:   

{11:4} Not at all considering the power of God but puffed up withhis ten thousands of footmen, and his thousands of horsemen, and hisfourscore elephants.   

{11:5} So he came to Judea, and drew near to Bethsura, which was astrong town, but distant from Jerusalem about five furlongs, and helaid sore siege unto it.   

{11:6} Now when they that were with Maccabeus heard that he besiegedthe holds, they and all the people with lamentation and tears besoughtthe Lord that he would send a good angel to deliver Israel.   

{11:7} Then Maccabeus himself first of all took weapons, exhortingthe other that they would jeopard themselves together with him to helptheir brethren: so they went forth together with a willing mind.   

{11:8} And as they were at Jerusalem, there appeared before them onhorseback one in white clothing, shaking his armour of gold.   

{11:9} Then they praised the merciful God all together, and tookheart, insomuch that they were ready not only to fight with men, butwith most cruel beasts, and to pierce through walls of iron.   

{11:10} Thus they marched forward in their armour, having an helperfrom heaven: for the Lord was merciful unto them   

{11:11} And giving a charge upon their enemies like lions, they sleweleven thousand footmen, and sixteen hundred horsemen, and put all theother to flight.   

{11:12} Many of them also being wounded escaped naked; and Lysiashimself fled away shamefully, and so escaped.   

{11:13} Who, as he was a man of understanding, casting with himselfwhat loss he had had, and considering that the Hebrews could not beovercome, because the Almighty God helped them, he sent unto them,   

{11:14} And persuaded them to agree to all reasonable conditions,and promised that he would persuade the king that he must needs be afriend unto them.   

{11:15} Then Maccabeus consented to all that Lysias desired, beingcareful of the common good; and whatsoever Maccabeus wrote unto Lysiasconcerning the Jews, the king granted it.   

{11:16} For there were letters written unto the Jews from Lysias tothis effect: Lysias unto the people of the Jews sendeth greeting:   

{11:17} John and Absolom, who were sent from you, delivered me thepetition subscribed, and made request for the performance of thecontents thereof.   

{11:18} Therefore what things soever were meet to be reported to theking, I have declared them, and he hath granted as much as might be.   

{11:19} And if then ye will keep yourselves loyal to the state,hereafter also will I endeavour to be a means of your good.   

{11:20} But of the particulars I have given order both to these andthe other that came from me, to commune with you.   

{11:21} Fare ye well. The hundred and eight and fortieth year, thefour and twentieth day of the month Dioscorinthius.   

{11:22} Now the king's letter contained these words: King Antiochusunto his brother Lysias sendeth greeting:   

{11:23} Since our father is translated unto the gods, our will is,that they that are in our realm live quietly, that every one may attendupon his own affairs.   

{11:24} We understand also that the Jews would not consent to ourfather, for to be brought unto the custom of the Gentiles, but hadrather keep their own manner of living: for the which cause theyrequire of us, that we should suffer them to live after their own laws.   

{11:25} Wherefore our mind is, that this nation shall be in rest,and we have determined to restore them their temple, that they may liveaccording to the customs of their forefathers.   

{11:26} Thou shalt do well therefore to send unto them, and grantthem peace, that when they are certified of our mind, they may be ofgood comfort, and ever go cheerfully about their own affairs.   

{11:27} And the letter of the king unto the nation of the Jews wasafter this manner: King Antiochus sendeth greeting unto the council,and the rest of the Jews:   

{11:28} If ye fare well, we have our desire; we are also in goodhealth.   

{11:29} Menelaus declared unto us, that your desire was to returnhome, and to follow your own business:   

{11:30} Wherefore they that will depart shall have safe conduct tillthe thirtieth day of Xanthicus with security.   

{11:31} And the Jews shall use their own kind of meats and laws, asbefore; and none of them any manner of ways shall be molested forthings ignorantly done.   

{11:32} I have sent also Menelaus, that he may comfort you.   

{11:33} Fare ye well. In the hundred forty and eighth year, and thefifteenth day of the month Xanthicus.   

{11:34} The Romans also sent unto them a letter containing thesewords: Quintus Memmius and Titus Manlius, ambassadors of the Romans,send greeting unto the people of the Jews.   

{11:35} Whatsoever Lysias the king's cousin hath granted, therewithwe also are well pleased.   

{11:36} But touching such things as he judged to be referred to theking, after ye have advised thereof, send one forthwith, that we maydeclare as it is convenient for you: for we are now going to Antioch.   

{11:37} Therefore send some with speed, that we may know what isyour mind.   

{11:38} Farewell. This hundred and eight and fortieth year, thefifteenth day of the month Xanthicus.   

{12:1} When these covenants were made, Lysias went unto the king,and the Jews were about their husbandry.   

{12:2} But of the governours of several places, Timotheus, andApollonius the son of Genneus, also Hieronymus, and Demophon, andbeside them Nicanor the governor of Cyprus, would not suffer them to bequiet and live in peace.   

{12:3} The men of Joppa also did such an ungodly deed: they prayedthe Jews that dwelt among them to go with their wives and children intothe boats which they had prepared, as though they had meant them nohurt.   

{12:4} Who accepted of it according to the common decree of thecity, as being desirous to live in peace, and suspecting nothing: butwhen they were gone forth into the deep, they drowned no less than twohundred of them.   

{12:5} When Judas heard of this cruelty done unto his countrymen, hecommanded those that were with him to make them ready.   

{12:6} And calling upon God the righteous Judge, he came againstthose murderers of his brethren, and burnt the haven by night, and setthe boats on fire, and those that fled thither he slew.   

{12:7} And when the town was shut up, he went backward, as if hewould return to root out all them of the city of Joppa.   

{12:8} But when he heard that the Jamnites were minded to do in likemanner unto the Jews that dwelt among them,   

{12:9} He came upon the Jamnites also by night, and set fire on thehaven and the navy, so that the light of the fire was seen at Jerusalemtwo hundred and forty furlongs off.   

{12:10} Now when they were gone from thence nine furlongs in theirjourney toward Timotheus, no fewer than five thousand men on foot andfive hundred horsemen of the Arabians set upon him.   

{12:11} Whereupon there was a very sore battle; but Judas' side bythe help of God got the victory; so that the Nomades of Arabia, beingovercome, besought Judas for peace, promising both to give him cattle,and to pleasure him otherwise.   

{12:12} Then Judas, thinking indeed that they would be profitable inmany things, granted them peace: whereupon they shook hands, and sothey departed to their tents.   

{12:13} He went also about to make a bridge to a certain strongcity, which was fenced about with walls, and inhabited by people ofdivers countries; and the name of it was Caspis.   

{12:14} But they that were within it put such trust in the strengthof the walls and provision of victuals, that they behaved themselvesrudely toward them that were with Judas, railing and blaspheming, anduttering such words as were not to be spoken.   

{12:15} Wherefore Judas with his company, calling upon the greatLord of the world, who without rams or engines of war did cast downJericho in the time of Joshua, gave a fierce assault against the walls,   

{12:16} And took the city by the will of God, and made unspeakableslaughters, insomuch that a lake two furlongs broad near adjoiningthereunto, being filled full, was seen running with blood.   

{12:17} Then departed they from thence seven hundred and fiftyfurlongs, and came to Characa unto the Jews that are called Tubieni.   

{12:18} But as for Timotheus, they found him not in the places: forbefore he had dispatched any thing, he departed from thence, havingleft a very strong garrison in a certain hold.   

{12:19} Howbeit Dositheus and Sosipater, who were of Maccabeus'captains, went forth, and slew those that Timotheus had left in thefortress, above ten thousand men.   

{12:20} And Maccabeus ranged his army by bands, and set them overthe bands, and went against Timotheus, who had about him an hundred andtwenty thousand men of foot, and two thousand and five hundred horsemen.   

{12:21} Now when Timotheus had knowledge of Judas' coming, he sentthe women and children and the other baggage unto a fortress calledCarnion: for the town was hard to besiege, and uneasy to come unto, byreason of the straitness of all the places.   

{12:22} But when Judas his first band came in sight, the enemies,being smitten with fear and terror through the appearing of him whoseeth all things, fled amain, one running into this way, another thatway, so as that they were often hurt of their own men, and wounded withthe points of their own swords.   

{12:23} Judas also was very earnest in pursuing them, killing thosewicked wretches, of whom he slew about thirty thousand men.   

{12:24} Moreover Timotheus himself fell into the hands of Dositheusand Sosipater, whom he besought with much craft to let him go with hislife, because he had many of the Jews' parents, and the brethren ofsome of them, who, if they put him to death, should not be regarded.   

{12:25} So when he had assured them with many words that he wouldrestore them without hurt, according to the agreement, they let him gofor the saving of their brethren.   

{12:26} Then Maccabeus marched forth to Carnion, and to the templeof Atargatis, and there he slew five and twenty thousand persons.   

{12:27} And after he had put to flight and destroyed them, Judasremoved the host toward Ephron, a strong city, wherein Lysias abode,and a great multitude of divers nations, and the strong young men keptthe walls, and defended them mightily: wherein also was great provisionof engines and darts.   

{12:28} But when Judas and his company had called upon Almighty God,who with his power breaketh the strength of his enemies, they won thecity, and slew twenty and five thousand of them that were within,   

{12:29} From thence they departed to Scythopolis, which lieth sixhundred furlongs from Jerusalem,   

{12:30} But when the Jews that dwelt there had testified that theScythopolitans dealt lovingly with them, and entreated them kindly inthe time of their adversity;   

{12:31} They gave them thanks, desiring them to be friendly stillunto them: and so they came to Jerusalem, the feast of the weeksapproaching.   

{12:32} And after the feast, called Pentecost, they went forthagainst Gorgias the governor of Idumea,   

{12:33} Who came out with three thousand men of foot and fourhundred horsemen.   

{12:34} And it happened that in their fighting together a few of theJews were slain.   

{12:35} At which time Dositheus, one of Bacenor's company, who wason horseback, and a strong man, was still upon Gorgias, and taking holdof his coat drew him by force; and when he would have taken that cursedman alive, a horseman of Thracia coming upon him smote off hisshoulder, so that Gorgias fled unto Marisa.   

{12:36} Now when they that were with Gorgias had fought long, andwere weary, Judas called upon the Lord, that he would shew himself tobe their helper and leader of the battle.   

{12:37} And with that he began in his own language, and sung psalmswith a loud voice, and rushing unawares upon Gorgias' men, he put themto flight.   

{12:38} So Judas gathered his host, and came into the city ofOdollam, And when the seventh day came, they purified themselves, asthe custom was, and kept the sabbath in the same place.   

{12:39} And upon the day following, as the use had been, Judas andhis company came to take up the bodies of them that were slain, and tobury them with their kinsmen in their fathers' graves.   

{12:40} Now under the coats of every one that was slain they foundthings consecrated to the idols of the Jamnites, which is forbidden theJews by the law. Then every man saw that this was the cause whereforethey were slain.   

{12:41} All men therefore praising the Lord, the righteous Judge,who had opened the things that were hid,   

{12:42} Betook themselves unto prayer, and besought him that the sincommitted might wholly be put out of remembrance. Besides, that nobleJudas exhorted the people to keep themselves from sin, forsomuch asthey saw before their eyes the things that came to pass for the sins ofthose that were slain.   

{12:43} And when he had made a gathering throughout the company tothe sum of two thousand drachms of silver, he sent it to Jerusalem tooffer a sin offering, doing therein very well and honestly, in that hewas mindful of the resurrection:   

{12:44} For if he had not hoped that they that were slain shouldhave risen again, it had been superfluous and vain to pray for the dead.   

{12:45} And also in that he perceived that there was great favourlaid up for those that died godly, it was an holy and good thought.Whereupon he made a reconciliation for the dead, that they might bedelivered from sin.   

{13:1} In the hundred forty and ninth year it was told Judas, thatAntiochus Eupator was coming with a great power into Judea,   

{13:2} And with him Lysias his protector, and ruler of his affairs,having either of them a Grecian power of footmen, an hundred and tenthousand, and horsemen five thousand and three hundred, and elephantstwo and twenty, and three hundred chariots armed with hooks.   

{13:3} Menelaus also joined himself with them, and with greatdissimulation encouraged Antiochus, not for the safeguard of thecountry, but because he thought to have been made governor.   

{13:4} But the King of kings moved Antiochus' mind against thiswicked wretch, and Lysias informed the king that this man was the causeof all mischief, so that the king commanded to bring him unto Berea,and to put him to death, as the manner is in that place.   

{13:5} Now there was in that place a tower of fifty cubits high,full of ashes, and it had a round instrument which on every side hangeddown into the ashes.   

{13:6} And whosoever was condemned of sacrilege, or had committedany other grievous crime, there did all men thrust him unto death.   

{13:7} Such a death it happened that wicked man to die, not havingso much as burial in the earth; and that most justly:   

{13:8} For inasmuch as he had committed many sins about the altar,whose fire and ashes were holy, he received his death in ashes.   

{13:9} Now the king came with a barbarous and haughty mind to do farworse to the Jews, than had been done in his father's time.   

{13:10} Which things when Judas perceived, he commanded themultitude to call upon the Lord night and day, that if ever at anyother time, he would now also help them, being at the point to be putfrom their law, from their country, and from the holy temple:   

{13:11} And that he would not suffer the people, that had even nowbeen but a little refreshed, to be in subjection to the blasphemousnations.   

{13:12} So when they had all done this together, and besought themerciful Lord with weeping and fasting, and lying flat upon the groundthree days long, Judas, having exhorted them, commanded they should bein a readiness.   

{13:13} And Judas, being apart with the elders, determined, beforethe king's host should enter into Judea, and get the city, to go forthand try the matter in fight by the help of the Lord.   

{13:14} So when he had committed all to the Creator of the world,and exhorted his soldiers to fight manfully, even unto death, for thelaws, the temple, the city, the country, and the commonwealth, hecamped by Modin:   

{13:15} And having given the watchword to them that were about him,Victory is of God; with the most valiant and choice young men he wentin into the king's tent by night, and slew in the camp about fourthousand men, and the chiefest of the elephants, with all that wereupon him.   

{13:16} And at last they filled the camp with fear and tumult, anddeparted with good success.   

{13:17} This was done in the break of the day, because theprotection of the Lord did help him.   

{13:18} Now when the king had taken a taste of the manliness of theJews, he went about to take the holds by policy,   

{13:19} And marched toward Bethsura, which was a strong hold of theJews: but he was put to flight, failed, and lost of his men:   

{13:20} For Judas had conveyed unto them that were in it such thingsas were necessary.   

{13:21} But Rhodocus, who was in the Jews' host, disclosed thesecrets to the enemies; therefore he was sought out, and when they hadgotten him, they put him in prison.   

{13:22} The king treated with them in Bethsum the second time, gavehis hand, took their's, departed, fought with Judas, was overcome;   

{13:23} Heard that Philip, who was left over the affairs in Antioch,was desperately bent, confounded, intreated the Jews, submittedhimself, and sware to all equal conditions, agreed with them, andoffered sacrifice, honoured the temple, and dealt kindly with the place,   

{13:24} And accepted well of Maccabeus, made him principal governorfrom Ptolemais unto the Gerrhenians;   

{13:25} Came to Ptolemais: the people there were grieved for thecovenants; for they stormed, because they would make their covenantsvoid:   

{13:26} Lysias went up to the judgment seat, said as much as couldbe in defence of the cause, persuaded, pacified, made them wellaffected, returned to Antioch. Thus it went touching the king's comingand departing.   

{14:1} After three years was Judas informed, that Demetrius the sonof Seleucus, having entered by the haven of Tripolis with a great powerand navy,   

{14:2} Had taken the country, and killed Antiochus, and Lysias hisprotector.   

{14:3} Now one Alcimus, who had been high priest, and had defiledhimself wilfully in the times of their mingling with the Gentiles,seeing that by no means he could save himself, nor have any more accessto the holy altar,   

{14:4} Came to king Demetrius in the hundred and one and fiftiethyear, presenting unto him a crown of gold, and a palm, and also of theboughs which were used solemnly in the temple: and so that day he heldhis peace.   

{14:5} Howbeit having gotten opportunity to further his foolishenterprize, and being called into counsel by Demetrius, and asked howthe Jews stood affected, and what they intended, he answered thereunto:   

{14:6} Those of the Jews that he called Assideans, whose captain isJudas Maccabeus, nourish war and are seditious, and will not let therest be in peace.   

{14:7} Therefore I, being deprived of mine ancestors' honour, I meanthe high priesthood, am now come hither:   

{14:8} First, verily for the unfeigned care I have of thingspertaining to the king; and secondly, even for that I intend the goodof mine own countrymen: for all our nation is in no small miserythrough the unadvised dealing of them aforersaid.   

{14:9} Wherefore, O king, seeing knowest all these things, becareful for the country, and our nation, which is pressed on everyside, according to the clemency that thou readily shewest unto all.   

{14:10} For as long as Judas liveth, it is not possible that thestate should be quiet.   

{14:11} This was no sooner spoken of him, but others of the king'sfriends, being maliciously set against Judas, did more incenseDemetrius.   

{14:12} And forthwith calling Nicanor, who had been master of theelephants, and making him governor over Judea, he sent him forth,   

{14:13} Commanding him to slay Judas, and to scatter them that werewith him, and to make Alcimus high priest of the great temple.   

{14:14} Then the heathen, that had fled out of Judea from Judas,came to Nicanor by flocks, thinking the harm and calamities ot the Jewsto be their welfare.   

{14:15} Now when the Jews heard of Nicanor's coming, and that theheathen were up against them, they cast earth upon their heads, andmade supplication to him that had established his people for ever, andwho always helpeth his portion with manifestation of his presence.   

{14:16} So at the commandment of the captain they removedstraightways from thence, and came near unto them at the town of Dessau.   

{14:17} Now Simon, Judas' brother, had joined battle with Nicanor,but was somewhat discomfited through the sudden silence of his enemies.   

{14:18} Nevertheless Nicanor, hearing of the manliness of them thatwere with Judas, and the courageousness that they had to fight fortheir country, durst not try the matter by the sword.   

{14:19} Wherefore he sent Posidonius, and Theodotus, and Mattathias,to make peace.   

{14:20} So when they had taken long advisement thereupon, and thecaptain had made the multitude acquainted therewith, and it appearedthat they were all of one mind, they consented to the covenants,   

{14:21} And appointed a day to meet in together by themselves: andwhen the day came, and stools were set for either of them,   

{14:22} Ludas placed armed men ready in convenient places, lest sometreachery should be suddenly practised by the enemies: so they made apeaceable conference.   

{14:23} Now Nicanor abode in Jerusalem, and did no hurt, but sentaway the people that came flocking unto him.   

{14:24} And he would not willingly have Judas out of his sight: forhe love the man from his heart   

{14:25} He prayed him also to take a wife, and to beget children: sohe married, was quiet, and took part of this life.   

{14:26} But Alcimus, perceiving the love that was betwixt them, andconsidering the covenants that were made, came to Demetrius, and toldhim that Nicanor was not well affected toward the state; for that hehad ordained Judas, a traitor to his realm, to be the king's successor.   

{14:27} Then the king being in a rage, and provoked with theaccusations of the most wicked man, wrote to Nicanor, signifying thathe was much displeased with the covenants, and commanding him that heshould send Maccabeus prisoner in all haste unto Antioch.   

{14:28} When this came to Nicanor's hearing, he was much confoundedin himself, and took it grievously that he should make void thearticles which were agreed upon, the man being in no fault.   

{14:29} But because there was no dealing against the king, hewatched his time to accomplish this thing by policy.   

{14:30} Notwithstanding, when Maccabeus saw that Nicanor began to bechurlish unto him, and that he entreated him more roughly than he waswont, perceiving that such sour behaviour came not of good, he gatheredtogether not a few of his men, and withdrew himself from Nicanor.   

{14:31} But the other, knowing that he was notably prevented byJudas' policy, came into the great and holy temple, and commanded thepriests, that were offering their usual sacrifices, to deliver him theman.   

{14:32} And when they sware that they could not tell where the manwas whom he sought,   

{14:33} He stretched out his right hand toward the temple, and madean oath in this manner: If ye will not deliver me Judas as a prisoner,I will lay this temple of God even with the ground, and I will breakdown the altar, and erect a notable temple unto Bacchus.   

{14:34} After these words he departed. Then the priests lifted uptheir hands toward heaven, and besought him that was ever a defender oftheir nation, saying in this manner;   

{14:35} Thou, O Lord of all things, who hast need of nothing, wastpleased that the temple of thine habitation should be among us:   

{14:36} Therefore now, O holy Lord of all holiness, keep this houseever undefiled, which lately was cleansed, and stop every unrighteousmouth.   

{14:37} Now was there accused unto Nicanor one Razis, one of theelders of Jerusalem, a lover of his countrymen, and a man of very goodreport, who for his kindness was called a father of the Jews.   

{14:38} For in the former times, when they mingled not themselveswith the Gentiles, he had been accused of Judaism, and did boldlyjeopard his body and life with all vehemency for the religion of theJews.   

{14:39} So Nicanor, willing to declare the hate that he bare untothe Jews, sent above five hundred men of war to take him:   

{14:40} For he thought by taking him to do the Jews much hurt.   

{14:41} Now when the multitude would have taken the tower, andviolently broken into the outer door, and bade that fire should bebrought to burn it, he being ready to be taken on every side fell uponhis sword;   

{14:42} Choosing rather to die manfully, than to come into the handsof the wicked, to be abused otherwise than beseemed his noble birth:   

{14:43} But missing his stroke through haste, the multitude alsorushing within the doors, he ran boldly up to the wall, and casthimself down manfully among the thickest of them.   

{14:44} But they quickly giving back, and a space being made, hefell down into the midst of the void place.   

{14:45} Nevertheless, while there was yet breath within him, beinginflamed with anger, he rose up; and though his blood gushed out likespouts of water, and his wounds were grievous, yet he ran through themidst of the throng; and standing upon a steep rock,   

{14:46} When as his blood was now quite gone, he plucked out hisbowels, and taking them in both his hands, he cast them upon thethrong, and calling upon the Lord of life and spirit to restore himthose again, he thus died.   

{15:1} But Nicanor, hearing that Judas and his company were in thestrong places about Samaria, resolved without any danger to set uponthem on the sabbath day.   

{15:2} Nevertheless the Jews that were compelled to go with himsaid, O destroy not so cruelly and barbarously, but give honour to thatday, which he, that seeth all things, hath honoured with holiness aboveall other days.   

{15:3} Then the most ungracious wretch demanded, if there were aMighty one in heaven, that had commanded the sabbath day to be kept.   

{15:4} And when they said, There is in heaven a living Lord, andmighty, who commanded the seventh day to be kept:   

{15:5} Then said the other, And I also am mighty upon earth, and Icommand to take arms, and to do the king's business. Yet he obtainednot to have his wicked will done.   

{15:6} So Nicanor in exceeding pride and haughtiness determined toset up a publick monument of his victory over Judas and them that werewith him.   

{15:7} But Maccabeus had ever sure confidence that the Lord wouldhelp him:   

{15:8} Wherefore he exhorted his people not to fear the coming ofthe heathen against them, but to remember the help which in formertimes they had received from heaven, and now to expect the victory andaid, which should come unto them from the Almighty.   

{15:9} And so comforting them out of the law and the prophets, andwithal putting them in mind of the battles that they won afore, he madethem more cheerful.   

{15:10} And when he had stirred up their minds, he gave them theircharge, shewing them therewithall the falsehood of the heathen, and thebreach of oaths.   

{15:11} Thus he armed every one of them, not so much with defence ofshields and spears, as with comfortable and good words: and besidethat, he told them a dream worthy to be believed, as if it had been soindeed, which did not a little rejoice them.   

{15:12} And this was his vision: That Onias, who had been highpriest, a virtuous and a good man, reverend in conversation, gentle incondition, well spoken also, and exercised from a child in all pointsof virtue, holding up his hands prayed for the whole body of the Jews.   

{15:13} This done, in like manner there appeared a man with grayhairs, and exceeding glorious, who was of a wonderful and excellentmajesty.   

{15:14} Then Onias answered, saying, This is a lover of thebrethren, who prayeth much for the people, and for the holy city, towit, Jeremias the prophet of God.   

{15:15} Whereupon Jeremias holding forth his right hand gave toJudas a sword of gold, and in giving it spake thus,   

{15:16} Take this holy sword, a gift from God, with the which thoushalt wound the adversaries.   

{15:17} Thus being well comforted by the words of Judas, which werevery good, and able to stir them up to valour, and to encourage thehearts of the young men, they determined not to pitch camp, butcourageously to set upon them, and manfully to try the matter byconflict, because the city and the sanctuary and the temple were indanger.   

{15:18} For the care that they took for their wives, and theirchildren, their brethren, and folks, was in least account with them:but the greatest and principal fear was for the holy temple.   

{15:19} Also they that were in the city took not the least care,being troubled for the conflict abroad.   

{15:20} And now, when as all looked what should be the trial, andthe enemies were already come near, and the army was set in array, andthe beasts conveniently placed, and the horsemen set in wings,   

{15:21} Maccabeus seeing the coming of the multitude, and the diverspreparations of armour, and the fierceness of the beasts, stretched outhis hands toward heaven, and called upon the Lord that worketh wonders,knowing that victory cometh not by arms, but even as it seemeth good tohim, he giveth it to such as are worthy:   

{15:22} Therefore in his prayer he said after this manner; O Lord,thou didst send thine angel in the time of Ezekias king of Judea, anddidst slay in the host of Sennacherib an hundred fourscore and fivethousand:   

{15:23} Wherefore now also, O Lord of heaven, send a good angelbefore us for a fear and dread unto them;   

{15:24} And through the might of thine arm let those be strickenwith terror, that come against thy holy people to blaspheme. And heended thus.   

{15:25} Then Nicanor and they that were with him came forward withtrumpets and songs.   

{15:26} But Judas and his company encountered the enemies withinvocation and prayer.   

{15:27} So that fighting with their hands, and praying unto God withtheir hearts, they slew no less than thirty and five thousand men: forthrough the appearance of God they were greatly cheered.   

{15:28} Now when the battle was done, returning again with joy, theyknew that Nicanor lay dead in his harness.   

{15:29} Then they made a great shout and a noise, praising theAlmighty in their own language.   

{15:30} And Judas, who was ever the chief defender of the citizensboth in body and mind, and who continued his love toward his countrymenall his life, commanded to strike off Nicanor's head, and his hand withhis shoulder, and bring them to Jerusalem.   

{15:31} So when he was there, and called them of his nationtogether, and set the priests before the altar, he sent for them thatwere of the tower,   

{15:32} And shewed them vile Nicanor's head, and the hand of thatblasphemer, which with proud brags he had stretched out against theholy temple of the Almighty.   

{15:33} And when he had cut out the tongue of that ungodly Nicanor,he commanded that they should give it by pieces unto the fowls, andhang up the reward of his madness before the temple.   

{15:34} So every man praised toward the heaven the glorious Lord,saying, Blessed be he that hath kept his own place undefiled.   

{15:35} He hanged also Nicanor's head upon the tower, an evident andmanifest sign unto all of the help of the Lord.   

{15:36} And they ordained all with a common decree in no case to letthat day pass without solemnity, but to celebrate the thirtieth day ofthe twelfth month, which in the Syrian tongue is called Adar, the daybefore Mardocheus' day.   

{15:37} Thus went it with Nicanor: and from that time forth theHebrews had the city in their power. And here will I make an end.   

{15:38} And if I have done well, and as is fitting the story, it isthat which I desired: but if slenderly and meanly, it is that which Icould attain unto.   

{15:39} For as it is hurtful to drink wine or water alone; and aswine mingled with water is pleasant, and delighteth the taste: even sospeech finely framed delighteth the ears of them that read the story.And here shall be an end.
