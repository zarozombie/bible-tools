{The General Epistle of Jude   

{1:1} Jude, the servant of Jesus Christ, and brother of James, tothem that are sanctified by God the Father, and preserved in JesusChrist, [and] called: 

{1:2} Mercy unto you, and peace, and love, bemultiplied.   

{1:3} Beloved, when I gave all diligence to write unto you of thecommon salvation, it was needful for me to write unto you, and exhort[you] that ye should earnestly contend for the faith which was oncedelivered unto the saints. 

{1:4} For there are certain men crept inunawares, who were before of old ordained to this condemnation, ungodlymen, turning the grace of our God into lasciviousness, and denying theonly Lord God, and our Lord Jesus Christ. 

{1:5} I will therefore putyou in remembrance, though ye once knew this, how that the Lord, havingsaved the people out of the land of Egypt, afterward destroyed themthat believed not. 

{1:6} And the angels which kept not their firstestate, but left their own habitation, he hath reserved in everlastingchains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day. 

{1:7} Even asSodom and Gomorrha, and the cities about them in like manner, givingthemselves over to fornication, and going after strange flesh, are setforth for an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire. 

{1:8}Likewise also these [filthy] dreamers defile the flesh, despisedominion, and speak evil of dignities. 

{1:9} Yet Michael the archangel,when contending with the devil he disputed about the body of Moses,durst not bring against him a railing accusation, but said, The Lordrebuke thee. 

{1:10} But these speak evil of those things which theyknow not: but what they know naturally, as brute beasts, in thosethings they corrupt themselves. 

{1:11} Woe unto them! for they havegone in the way of Cain, and ran greedily after the error of Balaam forreward, and perished in the gainsaying of Core. 

{1:12} These are spotsin your feasts of charity, when they feast with you, feeding themselveswithout fear: clouds [they are] without water, carried about of winds;trees whose fruit withereth, without fruit, twice dead, plucked up bythe roots; 

{1:13} Raging waves of the sea, foaming out their own shame;wandering stars, to whom is reserved the blackness of darkness forever. 

{1:14} And Enoch also, the seventh from Adam, prophesied ofthese, saying, Behold, the Lord cometh with ten thousands of hissaints, 

{1:15} To execute judgment upon all, and to convince all thatare ungodly among them of all their ungodly deeds which they haveungodly committed, and of all their hard [speeches] which ungodlysinners have spoken against him. 

{1:16} These are murmurers,complainers, walking after their own lusts; and their mouth speakethgreat swelling [words,] having men's persons in admiration because ofadvantage.   

{1:17} But, beloved, remember ye the words which were spoken beforeof the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ; 

{1:18} How that they told youthere should be mockers in the last time, who should walk after theirown ungodly lusts. 

{1:19} These be they who separate themselves,sensual, having not the Spirit. 

{1:20} But ye, beloved, building upyourselves on your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Ghost, 

{1:21}Keep yourselves in the love of God, looking for the mercy of our LordJesus Christ unto eternal life. 

{1:22} And of some have compassion,making a difference: 

{1:23} And others save with fear, pulling [them]out of the fire; hating even the garment spotted by the flesh.   

{1:24} Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling, and topresent [you] faultless before the presence of his glory with exceedingjoy, 

{1:25} To the only wise God our Saviour, [be] glory and majesty,dominion and power, both now and ever. Amen.
