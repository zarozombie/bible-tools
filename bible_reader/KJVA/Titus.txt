{The Epistle of Paul to Titus   

{1:1} Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ,according to the faith of God's elect, and the acknowledging of thetruth which is after godliness; 

{1:2} In hope of eternal life, whichGod, that cannot lie, promised before the world began; 

{1:3} But hathin due times manifested his word through preaching, which is committedunto me according to the commandment of God our Saviour; 

{1:4} ToTitus, [mine] own son after the common faith: Grace, mercy, [and]peace, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Saviour.   

{1:5} For this cause left I thee in Crete, that thou shouldest setin order the things that are wanting, and ordain elders in every city,as I had appointed thee: 

{1:6} If any be blameless, the husband of onewife, having faithful children not accused of riot or unruly. 

{1:7} Fora bishop must be blameless, as the steward of God; not selfwilled, notsoon angry, not given to wine, no striker, not given to filthy lucre;

{1:8} But a lover of hospitality, a lover of good men, sober, just,holy, temperate; 

{1:9} Holding fast the faithful word as he hath beentaught, that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and toconvince the gainsayers. 

{1:10} For there are many unruly and vaintalkers and deceivers, specially they of the circumcision: 

{1:11} Whosemouths must be stopped, who subvert whole houses, teaching things whichthey ought not, for filthy lucre's sake. 

{1:12} One of themselves,[even] a prophet of their own, said, The Cretians [are] alway liars,evil beasts, slow bellies. 

{1:13} This witness is true. Whereforerebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith; 

{1:14} Notgiving heed to Jewish fables, and commandments of men, that turn fromthe truth. 

{1:15} Unto the pure all things [are] pure: but unto themthat are defiled and unbelieving [is] nothing pure; but even their mindand conscience is defiled. 

{1:16} They profess that they know God; butin works they deny [him,] being abominable, and disobedient, and untoevery good work reprobate.   

{2:1} But speak thou the things which become sound doctrine: 

{2:2}That the aged men be sober, grave, temperate, sound in faith, incharity, in patience. 

{2:3} The aged women likewise, that [they be] inbehaviour as becometh holiness, not false accusers, not given to muchwine, teachers of good things; 

{2:4} That they may teach the youngwomen to be sober, to love their husbands, to love their children,

{2:5} [To be] discreet, chaste, keepers at home, good, obedient totheir own husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed. 

{2:6} Youngmen likewise exhort to be sober minded. 

{2:7} In all things shewingthyself a pattern of good works: in doctrine [shewing] uncorruptness,gravity, sincerity, 

{2:8} Sound speech, that cannot be condemned; thathe that is of the contrary part may be ashamed, having no evil thing tosay of you. 

{2:9} [Exhort] servants to be obedient unto their ownmasters, [and] to please [them] well in all [things;] not answeringagain; 

{2:10} Not purloining, but shewing all good fidelity; that theymay adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things. 

{2:11} For thegrace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men, 

{2:12}Teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should livesoberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world; 

{2:13} Lookingfor that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God andour Saviour Jesus Christ; 

{2:14} Who gave himself for us, that he mightredeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar people,zealous of good works. 

{2:15} These things speak, and exhort, andrebuke with all authority. Let no man despise thee.   

{3:1} Put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers,to obey magistrates, to be ready to every good work, 

{3:2} To speakevil of no man, to be no brawlers, [but] gentle, shewing all meeknessunto all men. 

{3:3} For we ourselves also were sometimes foolish,disobedient, deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures, living inmalice and envy, hateful, [and] hating one another. 

{3:4} But afterthat the kindness and love of God our Saviour toward man appeared,

{3:5} Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but accordingto his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewingof the Holy Ghost; 

{3:6} Which he shed on us abundantly through JesusChrist our Saviour; 

{3:7} That being justified by his grace, we shouldbe made heirs according to the hope of eternal life. 

{3:8} [This is] afaithful saying, and these things I will that thou affirm constantly,that they which have believed in God might be careful to maintain goodworks. These things are good and profitable unto men. 

{3:9} But avoidfoolish questions, and genealogies, and contentions, and strivingsabout the law; for they are unprofitable and vain. 

{3:10} A man that isan heretick after the first and second admonition reject; 

{3:11}Knowing that he that is such is subverted, and sinneth, being condemnedof himself.   

{3:12} When I shall send Artemas unto thee, or Tychicus, be diligentto come unto me to Nicopolis: for I have determined there to winter.

{3:13} Bring Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey diligently,that nothing be wanting unto them. 

{3:14} And let ours also learn tomaintain good works for necessary uses, that they be not unfruitful.   

{3:15} All that are with me salute thee. Greet them that love us inthe faith. Grace [be] with you all. Amen.
