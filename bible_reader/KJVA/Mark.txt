{The Gospel According to St. Mark   

{1:1} The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God;

{1:2} As it is written in the prophets, Behold, I send my messengerbefore thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee. 

{1:3} Thevoice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord,make his paths straight. 

{1:4} John did baptize in the wilderness, andpreach the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins. 

{1:5} Andthere went out unto him all the land of Judaea, and they of Jerusalem,and were all baptized of him in the river of Jordan, confessing theirsins. 

{1:6} And John was clothed with camel's hair, and with a girdleof a skin about his loins; and he did eat locusts and wild honey; 

{1:7}And preached, saying, There cometh one mightier than I after me, thelatchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop down and unloose. 

{1:8}I indeed have baptized you with water: but he shall baptize you withthe Holy Ghost. 

{1:9} And it came to pass in those days, that Jesuscame from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized of John in Jordan.

{1:10} And straightway coming up out of the water, he saw the heavensopened, and the Spirit like a dove descending upon him: 

{1:11} Andthere came a voice from heaven, [saying,] Thou art my beloved Son, inwhom I am well pleased. 

{1:12} And immediately the Spirit driveth himinto the wilderness. 

{1:13} And he was there in the wilderness fortydays, tempted of Satan; and was with the wild beasts; and the angelsministered unto him. 

{1:14} Now after that John was put in prison,Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God,

{1:15} And saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is athand: repent ye, and believe the gospel. 

{1:16} Now as he walked by thesea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew his brother casting a net intothe sea: for they were fishers. 

{1:17} And Jesus said unto them, Comeye after me, and I will make you to become fishers of men. 

{1:18} Andstraightway they forsook their nets, and followed him. 

{1:19} And whenhe had gone a little farther thence, he saw James the [son] of Zebedee,and John his brother, who also were in the ship mending their nets.

{1:20} And straightway he called them: and they left their fatherZebedee in the ship with the hired servants, and went after him. 

{1:21}And they went into Capernaum; and straightway on the sabbath day heentered into the synagogue, and taught. 

{1:22} And they were astonishedat his doctrine: for he taught them as one that had authority, and notas the scribes. 

{1:23} And there was in their synagogue a man with anunclean spirit; and he cried out, 

{1:24} Saying, Let [us] alone; whathave we to do with thee, thou Jesus of Nazareth? art thou come todestroy us? I know thee who thou art, the Holy One of God. 

{1:25} AndJesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out of him. 

{1:26}And when the unclean spirit had torn him, and cried with a loud voice,he came out of him. 

{1:27} And they were all amazed, insomuch that theyquestioned among themselves, saying, What thing is this? what newdoctrine [is] this? for with authority commandeth he even the uncleanspirits, and they do obey him. 

{1:28} And immediately his fame spreadabroad throughout all the region round about Galilee. 

{1:29} Andforthwith, when they were come out of the synagogue, they entered intothe house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John. 

{1:30} But Simon'swife's mother lay sick of a fever, and anon they tell him of her.

{1:31} And he came and took her by the hand, and lifted her up; andimmediately the fever left her, and she ministered unto them. 

{1:32}And at even, when the sun did set, they brought unto him all that werediseased, and them that were possessed with devils. 

{1:33} And all thecity was gathered together at the door. 

{1:34} And he healed many thatwere sick of divers diseases, and cast out many devils; and sufferednot the devils to speak, because they knew him. 

{1:35} And in themorning, rising up a great while before day, he went out, and departedinto a solitary place, and there prayed. 

{1:36} And Simon and they thatwere with him followed after him. 

{1:37} And when they had found him,they said unto him, All [men] seek for thee. 

{1:38} And he said untothem, Let us go into the next towns, that I may preach there also: fortherefore came I forth. 

{1:39} And he preached in their synagoguesthroughout all Galilee, and cast out devils. 

{1:40} And there came aleper to him, beseeching him, and kneeling down to him, and saying untohim, If thou wilt, thou canst make me clean. 

{1:41} And Jesus, movedwith compassion, put forth [his] hand, and touched him, and saith untohim, I will; be thou clean. 

{1:42} And as soon as he had spoken,immediately the leprosy departed from him, and he was cleansed. 

{1:43}And he straitly charged him, and forthwith sent him away; 

{1:44} Andsaith unto him, See thou say nothing to any man: but go thy way, shewthyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing those things whichMoses commanded, for a testimony unto them. 

{1:45} But he went out, andbegan to publish [it] much, and to blaze abroad the matter, insomuchthat Jesus could no more openly enter into the city, but was without indesert places: and they came to him from every quarter.   

{2:1} And again he entered into Capernaum, after [some] days; and itwas noised that he was in the house. 

{2:2} And straightway many weregathered together, insomuch that there was no room to receive [them,]no, not so much as about the door: and he preached the word unto them.

{2:3} And they come unto him, bringing one sick of the palsy, which wasborne of four. 

{2:4} And when they could not come nigh unto him for thepress, they uncovered the roof where he was: and when they had broken[it] up, they let down the bed wherein the sick of the palsy lay. 

{2:5}When Jesus saw their faith, he said unto the sick of the palsy, Son,thy sins be forgiven thee. 

{2:6} But there were certain of the scribessitting there, and reasoning in their hearts, 

{2:7} Why doth this [man]thus speak blasphemies? who can forgive sins but God only? 

{2:8} Andimmediately when Jesus perceived in his spirit that they so reasonedwithin themselves, he said unto them, Why reason ye these things inyour hearts? 

{2:9} Whether is it easier to say to the sick of thepalsy, [Thy] sins be forgiven thee; or to say, Arise, and take up thybed, and walk? 

{2:10} But that ye may know that the Son of man hathpower on earth to forgive sins, (he saith to the sick of the palsy,)

{2:11} I say unto thee, Arise, and take up thy bed, and go thy way intothine house. 

{2:12} And immediately he arose, took up the bed, and wentforth before them all; insomuch that they were all amazed, andglorified God, saying, We never saw it on this fashion. 

{2:13} And hewent forth again by the sea side; and all the multitude resorted untohim, and he taught them. 

{2:14} And as he passed by, he saw Levi the[son] of Alphaeus sitting at the receipt of custom, and said unto him,Follow me. And he arose and followed him. 

{2:15} And it came to pass,that, as Jesus sat at meat in his house, many publicans and sinners satalso together with Jesus and his disciples: for there were many, andthey followed him. 

{2:16} And when the scribes and Pharisees saw himeat with publicans and sinners, they said unto his disciples, How is itthat he eateth and drinketh with publicans and sinners? 

{2:17} WhenJesus heard [it,] he saith unto them, They that are whole have no needof the physician, but they that are sick: I came not to call therighteous, but sinners to repentance. 

{2:18} And the disciples of Johnand of the Pharisees used to fast: and they come and say unto him, Whydo the disciples of John and of the Pharisees fast, but thy disciplesfast not? 

{2:19} And Jesus said unto them, Can the children of thebridechamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them? as long as theyhave the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast. 

{2:20} But the dayswill come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and thenshall they fast in those days. 

{2:21} No man also seweth a piece of newcloth on an old garment: else the new piece that filled it up takethaway from the old, and the rent is made worse. 

{2:22} And no manputteth new wine into old bottles: else the new wine doth burst thebottles, and the wine is spilled, and the bottles will be marred: butnew wine must be put into new bottles. 

{2:23} And it came to pass, thathe went through the corn fields on the sabbath day; and his disciplesbegan, as they went, to pluck the ears of corn. 

{2:24} And thePharisees said unto him, Behold, why do they on the sabbath day thatwhich is not lawful? 

{2:25} And he said unto them, Have ye never readwhat David did, when he had need, and was an hungred, he, and they thatwere with him? 

{2:26} How he went into the house of God in the days ofAbiathar the high priest, and did eat the shewbread, which is notlawful to eat but for the priests, and gave also to them which werewith him? 

{2:27} And he said unto them, The sabbath was made for man,and not man for the sabbath: 

{2:28} Therefore the Son of man is Lordalso of the sabbath.   

{3:1} And he entered again into the synagogue; and there was a manthere which had a withered hand. 

{3:2} And they watched him, whether hewould heal him on the sabbath day; that they might accuse him. 

{3:3}And he saith unto the man which had the withered hand, Stand forth.

{3:4} And he saith unto them, Is it lawful to do good on the sabbathdays, or to do evil? to save life, or to kill? But they held theirpeace. 

{3:5} And when he had looked round about on them with anger,being grieved for the hardness of their hearts, he saith unto the man,Stretch forth thine hand. And he stretched [it] out: and his hand wasrestored whole as the other. 

{3:6} And the Pharisees went forth, andstraightway took counsel with the Herodians against him, how they mightdestroy him. 

{3:7} But Jesus withdrew himself with his disciples to thesea: and a great multitude from Galilee followed him, and from Judaea,

{3:8} And from Jerusalem, and from Idumaea, and [from] beyond Jordan;and they about Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude, when they had heardwhat great things he did, came unto him. 

{3:9} And he spake to hisdisciples, that a small ship should wait on him because of themultitude, lest they should throng him. 

{3:10} For he had healed many;insomuch that they pressed upon him for to touch him, as many as hadplagues. 

{3:11} And unclean spirits, when they saw him, fell downbefore him, and cried, saying, Thou art the Son of God. 

{3:12} And hestraitly charged them that they should not make him known. 

{3:13} Andhe goeth up into a mountain, and calleth [unto him] whom he would: andthey came unto him. 

{3:14} And he ordained twelve, that they should bewith him, and that he might send them forth to preach, 

{3:15} And tohave power to heal sicknesses, and to cast out devils: 

{3:16} And Simonhe surnamed Peter; 

{3:17} And James the [son] of Zebedee, and John thebrother of James; and he surnamed them Boanerges, which is, The sons ofthunder: 

{3:18} And Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew,and Thomas, and James the [son] of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus, and Simonthe Canaanite, 

{3:19} And Judas Iscariot, which also betrayed him: andthey went into an house. 

{3:20} And the multitude cometh togetheragain, so that they could not so much as eat bread. 

{3:21} And when hisfriends heard [of it,] they went out to lay hold on him: for they said,He is beside himself.   

{3:22} And the scribes which came down from Jerusalem said, He hathBeelzebub, and by the prince of the devils casteth he out devils.

{3:23} And he called them [unto him,] and said unto them in parables,How can Satan cast out Satan? 

{3:24} And if a kingdom be dividedagainst itself, that kingdom cannot stand. 

{3:25} And if a house bedivided against itself, that house cannot stand. 

{3:26} And if Satanrise up against himself, and be divided, he cannot stand, but hath anend. 

{3:27} No man can enter into a strong man's house, and spoil hisgoods, except he will first bind the strong man; and then he will spoilhis house. 

{3:28} Verily I say unto you, All sins shall be forgivenunto the sons of men, and blasphemies wherewith soever they shallblaspheme: 

{3:29} But he that shall blaspheme against the Holy Ghosthath never forgiveness, but is in danger of eternal damnation: 

{3:30}Because they said, He hath an unclean spirit.   

{3:31} There came then his brethren and his mother, and, standingwithout, sent unto him, calling him. 

{3:32} And the multitude sat abouthim, and they said unto him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethrenwithout seek for thee. 

{3:33} And he answered them, saying, Who is mymother, or my brethren? 

{3:34} And he looked round about on them whichsat about him, and said, Behold my mother and my brethren! 

{3:35} Forwhosoever shall do the will of God, the same is my brother, and mysister, and mother.   

{4:1} And he began again to teach by the sea side: and there wasgathered unto him a great multitude, so that he entered into a ship,and sat in the sea; and the whole multitude was by the sea on the land.

{4:2} And he taught them many things by parables, and said unto them inhis doctrine, 

{4:3} Hearken; Behold, there went out a sower to sow:

{4:4} And it came to pass, as he sowed, some fell by the way side, andthe fowls of the air came and devoured it up. 

{4:5} And some fell onstony ground, where it had not much earth; and immediately it sprangup, because it had no depth of earth: 

{4:6} But when the sun was up, itwas scorched; and because it had no root, it withered away. 

{4:7} Andsome fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up, and choked it, and ityielded no fruit. 

{4:8} And other fell on good ground, and did yieldfruit that sprang up and increased; and brought forth, some thirty, andsome sixty, and some an hundred. 

{4:9} And he said unto them, He thathath ears to hear, let him hear. 

{4:10} And when he was alone, theythat were about him with the twelve asked of him the parable. 

{4:11}And he said unto them, Unto you it is given to know the mystery of thekingdom of God: but unto them that are without, all these [things] aredone in parables: 

{4:12} That seeing they may see, and not perceive;and hearing they may hear, and not understand; lest at any time theyshould be converted, and [their] sins should be forgiven them. 

{4:13}And he said unto them, Know ye not this parable? and how then will yeknow all parables?   

{4:14} The sower soweth the word. 

{4:15} And these are they by theway side, where the word is sown; but when they have heard, Satancometh immediately, and taketh away the word that was sown in theirhearts. 

{4:16} And these are they likewise which are sown on stonyground; who, when they have heard the word, immediately receive it withgladness; 

{4:17} And have no root in themselves, and so endure but fora time: afterward, when affliction or persecution ariseth for theword's sake, immediately they are offended. 

{4:18} And these are theywhich are sown among thorns; such as hear the word, 

{4:19} And thecares of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts ofother things entering in, choke the word, and it becometh unfruitful.

{4:20} And these are they which are sown on good ground; such as hearthe word, and receive [it,] and bring forth fruit, some thirtyfold,some sixty, and some an hundred.   

{4:21} And he said unto them, Is a candle brought to be put under abushel, or under a bed? and not to be set on a candlestick? 

{4:22} Forthere is nothing hid, which shall not be manifested; neither was anything kept secret, but that it should come abroad. 

{4:23} If any manhave ears to hear, let him hear. 

{4:24} And he said unto them, Takeheed what ye hear: with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured toyou: and unto you that hear shall more be given. 

{4:25} For he thathath, to him shall be given: and he that hath not, from him shall betaken even that which he hath. 

{4:26} And he said, So is the kingdom ofGod, as if a man should cast seed into the ground; 

{4:27} And shouldsleep, and rise night and day, and the seed should spring and grow up,he knoweth not how. 

{4:28} For the earth bringeth forth fruit ofherself; first the blade, then the ear, after that the full corn in theear. 

{4:29} But when the fruit is brought forth, immediately he puttethin the sickle, because the harvest is come.   

{4:30} And he said, Whereunto shall we liken the kingdom of God? orwith what comparison shall we compare it? 

{4:31} [It is] like a grainof mustard seed, which, when it is sown in the earth, is less than allthe seeds that be in the earth: 

{4:32} But when it is sown, it growethup, and becometh greater than all herbs, and shooteth out greatbranches; so that the fowls of the air may lodge under the shadow ofit. 

{4:33} And with many such parables spake he the word unto them, asthey were able to hear [it. ]

{4:34} But without a parable spake he notunto them: and when they were alone, he expounded all things to hisdisciples. 

{4:35} And the same day, when the even was come, he saithunto them, Let us pass over unto the other side. 

{4:36} And when theyhad sent away the multitude, they took him even as he was in the ship.And there were also with him other little ships. 

{4:37} And there arosea great storm of wind, and the waves beat into the ship, so that it wasnow full. 

{4:38} And he was in the hinder part of the ship, asleep on apillow: and they awake him, and say unto him, Master, carest thou notthat we perish? 

{4:39} And he arose, and rebuked the wind, and saidunto the sea, Peace, be still. And the wind ceased, and there was agreat calm. 

{4:40} And he said unto them, Why are ye so fearful? how isit that ye have no faith? 

{4:41} And they feared exceedingly, and saidone to another, What manner of man is this, that even the wind and thesea obey him?   

{5:1} And they came over unto the other side of the sea, into thecountry of the Gadarenes. 

{5:2} And when he was come out of the ship,immediately there met him out of the tombs a man with an uncleanspirit, 

{5:3} Who had [his] dwelling among the tombs; and no man couldbind him, no, not with chains: 

{5:4} Because that he had been oftenbound with fetters and chains, and the chains had been plucked asunderby him, and the fetters broken in pieces: neither could any [man] tamehim. 

{5:5} And always, night and day, he was in the mountains, and inthe tombs, crying, and cutting himself with stones. 

{5:6} But when hesaw Jesus afar off, he ran and worshipped him, 

{5:7} And cried with aloud voice, and said, What have I to do with thee, Jesus, [thou] Son ofthe most high God? I adjure thee by God, that thou torment me not.

{5:8} For he said unto him, Come out of the man, [thou] unclean spirit.

{5:9} And he asked him, What [is] thy name? And he answered, saying, Myname [is] Legion: for we are many. 

{5:10} And he besought him much thathe would not send them away out of the country. 

{5:11} Now there wasthere nigh unto the mountains a great herd of swine feeding. 

{5:12} Andall the devils besought him, saying, Send us into the swine, that wemay enter into them. 

{5:13} And forthwith Jesus gave them leave. Andthe unclean spirits went out, and entered into the swine: and the herdran violently down a steep place into the sea, (they were about twothousand;) and were choked in the sea. 

{5:14} And they that fed theswine fled, and told [it] in the city, and in the country. And theywent out to see what it was that was done. 

{5:15} And they come toJesus, and see him that was possessed with the devil, and had thelegion, sitting, and clothed, and in his right mind: and they wereafraid. 

{5:16} And they that saw [it] told them how it befell to himthat was possessed with the devil, and [also] concerning the swine.

{5:17} And they began to pray him to depart out of their coasts. 

{5:18}And when he was come into the ship, he that had been possessed with thedevil prayed him that he might be with him. 

{5:19} Howbeit Jesussuffered him not, but saith unto him, Go home to thy friends, and tellthem how great things the Lord hath done for thee, and hath hadcompassion on thee. 

{5:20} And he departed, and began to publish inDecapolis how great things Jesus had done for him: and all [men] didmarvel. 

{5:21} And when Jesus was passed over again by ship unto theother side, much people gathered unto him: and he was nigh unto thesea. 

{5:22} And, behold, there cometh one of the rulers of thesynagogue, Jairus by name; and when he saw him, he fell at his feet,

{5:23} And besought him greatly, saying, My little daughter lieth atthe point of death: [I pray thee,] come and lay thy hands on her, thatshe may be healed; and she shall live. 

{5:24} And [Jesus] went withhim; and much people followed him, and thronged him. 

{5:25} And acertain woman, which had an issue of blood twelve years, 

{5:26} And hadsuffered many things of many physicians, and had spent all that shehad, and was nothing bettered, but rather grew worse, 

{5:27} When shehad heard of Jesus, came in the press behind, and touched his garment.

{5:28} For she said, If I may touch but his clothes, I shall be whole.

{5:29} And straightway the fountain of her blood was dried up; and shefelt in [her] body that she was healed of that plague. 

{5:30} AndJesus, immediately knowing in himself that virtue had gone out of him,turned him about in the press, and said, Who touched my clothes? 

{5:31}And his disciples said unto him, Thou seest the multitude throngingthee, and sayest thou, Who touched me? 

{5:32} And he looked round aboutto see her that had done this thing. 

{5:33} But the woman fearing andtrembling, knowing what was done in her, came and fell down before him,and told him all the truth. 

{5:34} And he said unto her, Daughter, thyfaith hath made thee whole; go in peace, and be whole of thy plague.

{5:35} While he yet spake, there came from the ruler of the synagogue's[house certain] which said, Thy daughter is dead: why troublest thouthe Master any further? 

{5:36} As soon as Jesus heard the word that wasspoken, he saith unto the ruler of the synagogue, Be not afraid, onlybelieve. 

{5:37} And he suffered no man to follow him, save Peter, andJames, and John the brother of James. 

{5:38} And he cometh to the houseof the ruler of the synagogue, and seeth the tumult, and them that weptand wailed greatly. 

{5:39} And when he was come in, he saith unto them,Why make ye this ado, and weep? the damsel is not dead, but sleepeth.

{5:40} And they laughed him to scorn. But when he had put them all out,he taketh the father and the mother of the damsel, and them that werewith him, and entereth in where the damsel was lying. 

{5:41} And hetook the damsel by the hand, and said unto her, Talitha cumi; which is,being interpreted, Damsel, I say unto thee, arise. 

{5:42} Andstraightway the damsel arose, and walked; for she was [of the age] oftwelve years. And they were astonished with a great astonishment.

{5:43} And he charged them straitly that no man should know it; andcommanded that something should be given her to eat.   

{6:1} And he went out from thence, and came into his own country;and his disciples follow him. 

{6:2} And when the sabbath day was come,he began to teach in the synagogue: and many hearing [him] wereastonished, saying, From whence hath this [man] these things? and whatwisdom [is] this which is given unto him, that even such mighty worksare wrought by his hands? 

{6:3} Is not this the carpenter, the son ofMary, the brother of James, and Joses, and of Juda, and Simon? and arenot his sisters here with us? And they were offended at him. 

{6:4} ButJesus said unto them, A prophet is not without honour, but in his owncountry, and among his own kin, and in his own house. 

{6:5} And hecould there do no mighty work, save that he laid his hands upon a fewsick folk, and healed [them. ]

{6:6} And he marvelled because of theirunbelief. And he went round about the villages, teaching.   

{6:7} And he called [unto him] the twelve, and began to send themforth by two and two; and gave them power over unclean spirits; 

{6:8}And commanded them that they should take nothing for [their] journey,save a staff only; no scrip, no bread, no money in [their] purse: 

{6:9}But [be] shod with sandals; and not put on two coats. 

{6:10} And hesaid unto them, In what place soever ye enter into an house, thereabide till ye depart from that place. 

{6:11} And whosoever shall notreceive you, nor hear you, when ye depart thence, shake off the dustunder your feet for a testimony against them. Verily I say unto you, Itshall be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of judgment,than for that city. 

{6:12} And they went out, and preached that menshould repent. 

{6:13} And they cast out many devils, and anointed withoil many that were sick, and healed [them. ]

{6:14} And king Herod heard[of him;] (for his name was spread abroad:) and he said, That John theBaptist was risen from the dead, and therefore mighty works do shewforth themselves in him. 

{6:15} Others said, That it is Elias. Andothers said, That it is a prophet, or as one of the prophets. 

{6:16}But when Herod heard [thereof,] he said, It is John, whom I beheaded:he is risen from the dead. 

{6:17} For Herod himself had sent forth andlaid hold upon John, and bound him in prison for Herodias' sake, hisbrother Philip's wife: for he had married her. 

{6:18} For John had saidunto Herod, It is not lawful for thee to have thy brother's wife.

{6:19} Therefore Herodias had a quarrel against him, and would havekilled him; but she could not: 

{6:20} For Herod feared John, knowingthat he was a just man and an holy, and observed him; and when he heardhim, he did many things, and heard him gladly. 

{6:21} And when aconvenient day was come, that Herod on his birthday made a supper tohis lords, high captains, and chief [estates] of Galilee; 

{6:22} Andwhen the daughter of the said Herodias came in, and danced, and pleasedHerod and them that sat with him, the king said unto the damsel, Ask ofme whatsoever thou wilt, and I will give [it] thee. 

{6:23} And he swareunto her, Whatsoever thou shalt ask of me, I will give [it] thee, untothe half of my kingdom. 

{6:24} And she went forth, and said unto hermother, What shall I ask? And she said, The head of John the Baptist.

{6:25} And she came in straightway with haste unto the king, and asked,saying, I will that thou give me by and by in a charger the head ofJohn the Baptist. 

{6:26} And the king was exceeding sorry; [yet] forhis oath's sake, and for their sakes which sat with him, he would notreject her. 

{6:27} And immediately the king sent an executioner, andcommanded his head to be brought: and he went and beheaded him in theprison, 

{6:28} And brought his head in a charger, and gave it to thedamsel: and the damsel gave it to her mother. 

{6:29} And when hisdisciples heard [of it,] they came and took up his corpse, and laid itin a tomb. 

{6:30} And the apostles gathered themselves together untoJesus, and told him all things, both what they had done, and what theyhad taught. 

{6:31} And he said unto them, Come ye yourselves apart intoa desert place, and rest a while: for there were many coming and going,and they had no leisure so much as to eat. 

{6:32} And they departedinto a desert place by ship privately. 

{6:33} And the people saw themdeparting, and many knew him, and ran afoot thither out of all cities,and outwent them, and came together unto him. 

{6:34} And Jesus, when hecame out, saw much people, and was moved with compassion toward them,because they were as sheep not having a shepherd: and he began to teachthem many things. 

{6:35} And when the day was now far spent, hisdisciples came unto him, and said, This is a desert place, and now thetime [is] far passed: 

{6:36} Send them away, that they may go into thecountry round about, and into the villages, and buy themselves bread:for they have nothing to eat. 

{6:37} He answered and said unto them,Give ye them to eat. And they say unto him, Shall we go and buy twohundred pennyworth of bread, and give them to eat? 

{6:38} He saith untothem, How many loaves have ye? go and see. And when they knew, theysay, Five, and two fishes. 

{6:39} And he commanded them to make all sitdown by companies upon the green grass. 

{6:40} And they sat down inranks, by hundreds, and by fifties. 

{6:41} And when he had taken thefive loaves and the two fishes, he looked up to heaven, and blessed,and brake the loaves, and gave [them] to his disciples to set beforethem; and the two fishes divided he among them all. 

{6:42} And they didall eat, and were filled. 

{6:43} And they took up twelve baskets fullof the fragments, and of the fishes. 

{6:44} And they that did eat ofthe loaves were about five thousand men. 

{6:45} And straightway heconstrained his disciples to get into the ship, and to go to the otherside before unto Bethsaida, while he sent away the people. 

{6:46} Andwhen he had sent them away, he departed into a mountain to pray. 

{6:47}And when even was come, the ship was in the midst of the sea, and healone on the land. 

{6:48} And he saw them toiling in rowing; for thewind was contrary unto them: and about the fourth watch of the night hecometh unto them, walking upon the sea, and would have passed by them.

{6:49} But when they saw him walking upon the sea, they supposed it hadbeen a spirit, and cried out: 

{6:50} For they all saw him, and weretroubled. And immediately he talked with them, and saith unto them, Beof good cheer: it is I; be not afraid. 

{6:51} And he went up unto theminto the ship; and the wind ceased: and they were sore amazed inthemselves beyond measure, and wondered. 

{6:52} For they considered not[the miracle] of the loaves: for their heart was hardened. 

{6:53} Andwhen they had passed over, they came into the land of Gennesaret, anddrew to the shore. 

{6:54} And when they were come out of the ship,straightway they knew him, 

{6:55} And ran through that whole regionround about, and began to carry about in beds those that were sick,where they heard he was. 

{6:56} And whithersoever he entered, intovillages, or cities, or country, they laid the sick in the streets, andbesought him that they might touch if it were but the border of hisgarment: and as many as touched him were made whole.   

{7:1} Then came together unto him the Pharisees, and certain of thescribes, which came from Jerusalem. 

{7:2} And when they saw some of hisdisciples eat bread with defiled, that is to say, with unwashen, hands,they found fault. 

{7:3} For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, exceptthey wash [their] hands oft, eat not, holding the tradition of theelders. 

{7:4} And [when they come] from the market, except they wash,they eat not. And many other things there be, which they have receivedto hold, [as] the washing of cups, and pots, brasen vessels, and oftables. 

{7:5} Then the Pharisees and scribes asked him, Why walk notthy disciples according to the tradition of the elders, but eat breadwith unwashen hands? 

{7:6} He answered and said unto them, Well hathEsaias prophesied of you hypocrites, as it is written, This peoplehonoureth me with [their] lips, but their heart is far from me. 

{7:7}Howbeit in vain do they worship me, teaching [for] doctrines thecommandments of men. 

{7:8} For laying aside the commandment of God, yehold the tradition of men, [as] the washing of pots and cups: and manyother such like things ye do. 

{7:9} And he said unto them, Full well yereject the commandment of God, that ye may keep your own tradition.

{7:10} For Moses said, Honour thy father and thy mother; and, Whosocurseth father or mother, let him die the death: 

{7:11} But ye say, Ifa man shall say to his father or mother, [It is] Corban, that is tosay, a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me; [he shallbe free. ]

{7:12} And ye suffer him no more to do ought for his fatheror his mother; 

{7:13} Making the word of God of none effect throughyour tradition, which ye have delivered: and many such like things doye.   

{7:14} And when he had called all the people [unto him,] he saidunto them, Hearken unto me every one [of you,] and understand: 

{7:15}There is nothing from without a man, that entering into him can defilehim: but the things which come out of him, those are they that defilethe man. 

{7:16} If any man have ears to hear, let him hear. 

{7:17} Andwhen he was entered into the house from the people, his disciples askedhim concerning the parable. 

{7:18} And he saith unto them, Are ye sowithout understanding also? Do ye not perceive, that whatsoever thingfrom without entereth into the man, [it] cannot defile him; 

{7:19}Because it entereth not into his heart, but into the belly, and goethout into the draught, purging all meats? 

{7:20} And he said, That whichcometh out of the man, that defileth the man. 

{7:21} For from within,out of the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries,fornications, murders, 

{7:22} Thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit,lasciviousness, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness: 

{7:23} Allthese evil things come from within, and defile the man.   

{7:24} And from thence he arose, and went into the borders of Tyreand Sidon, and entered into an house, and would have no man know [it:]but he could not be hid. 

{7:25} For a [certain] woman, whose youngdaughter had an unclean spirit, heard of him, and came and fell at hisfeet: 

{7:26} The woman was a Greek, a Syrophenician by nation; and shebesought him that he would cast forth the devil out of her daughter.

{7:27} But Jesus said unto her, Let the children first be filled: forit is not meet to take the children's bread, and to cast [it] unto thedogs. 

{7:28} And she answered and said unto him, Yes, Lord: yet thedogs under the table eat of the children's crumbs. 

{7:29} And he saidunto her, For this saying go thy way; the devil is gone out of thydaughter. 

{7:30} And when she was come to her house, she found thedevil gone out, and her daughter laid upon the bed.   

{7:31} And again, departing from the coasts of Tyre and Sidon, hecame unto the sea of Galilee, through the midst of the coasts ofDecapolis. 

{7:32} And they bring unto him one that was deaf, and had animpediment in his speech; and they beseech him to put his hand uponhim. 

{7:33} And he took him aside from the multitude, and put hisfingers into his ears, and he spit, and touched his tongue; 

{7:34} Andlooking up to heaven, he sighed, and saith unto him, Ephphatha, thatis, Be opened. 

{7:35} And straightway his ears were opened, and thestring of his tongue was loosed, and he spake plain. 

{7:36} And hecharged them that they should tell no man: but the more he chargedthem, so much the more a great deal they published [it; ]

{7:37} Andwere beyond measure astonished, saying, He hath done all things well:he maketh both the deaf to hear, and the dumb to speak.   

{8:1} In those days the multitude being very great, and havingnothing to eat, Jesus called his disciples [unto him,] and saith untothem, 

{8:2} I have compassion on the multitude, because they have nowbeen with me three days, and have nothing to eat: 

{8:3} And if I sendthem away fasting to their own houses, they will faint by the way: fordivers of them came from far. 

{8:4} And his disciples answered him,From whence can a man satisfy these [men] with bread here in thewilderness? 

{8:5} And he asked them, How many loaves have ye? And theysaid, Seven. 

{8:6} And he commanded the people to sit down on theground: and he took the seven loaves, and gave thanks, and brake, andgave to his disciples to set before [them;] and they did set [them]before the people. 

{8:7} And they had a few small fishes: and heblessed, and commanded to set them also before [them. ]

{8:8} So theydid eat, and were filled: and they took up of the broken [meat] thatwas left seven baskets. 

{8:9} And they that had eaten were about fourthousand: and he sent them away. 

{8:10} And straightway he entered intoa ship with his disciples, and came into the parts of Dalmanutha.

{8:11} And the Pharisees came forth, and began to question with him,seeking of him a sign from heaven, tempting him. 

{8:12} And he sigheddeeply in his spirit, and saith, Why doth this generation seek after asign? verily I say unto you, There shall no sign be given unto thisgeneration. 

{8:13} And he left them, and entering into the ship againdeparted to the other side.   

{8:14} Now [the disciples] had forgotten to take bread, neither hadthey in the ship with them more than one loaf. 

{8:15} And he chargedthem, saying, Take heed, beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, and[of] the leaven of Herod. 

{8:16} And they reasoned among themselves,saying, [It is] because we have no bread. 

{8:17} And when Jesus knew[it,] he saith unto them, Why reason ye, because ye have no bread?perceive ye not yet, neither understand? have ye your heart yethardened? 

{8:18} Having eyes, see ye not? and having ears, hear ye not?and do ye not remember? 

{8:19} When I brake the five loaves among fivethousand, how many baskets full of fragments took ye up? They say untohim, Twelve. 

{8:20} And when the seven among four thousand, how manybaskets full of fragments took ye up? And they said, Seven. 

{8:21} Andhe said unto them, How is it that ye do not understand?   

{8:22} And he cometh to Bethsaida; and they bring a blind man untohim, and besought him to touch him. 

{8:23} And he took the blind man bythe hand, and led him out of the town; and when he had spit on hiseyes, and put his hands upon him, he asked him if he saw ought. 

{8:24}And he looked up, and said, I see men as trees, walking. 

{8:25} Afterthat he put [his] hands again upon his eyes, and made him look up: andhe was restored, and saw every man clearly. 

{8:26} And he sent him awayto his house, saying, Neither go into the town, nor tell [it] to any inthe town.   

{8:27} And Jesus went out, and his disciples, into the towns ofCaesarea Philippi: and by the way he asked his disciples, saying untothem, Whom do men say that I am? 

{8:28} And they answered, John theBaptist: but some [say,] Elias; and others, One of the prophets. 

{8:29}And he saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am? And Peter answerethand saith unto him, Thou art the Christ. 

{8:30} And he charged themthat they should tell no man of him. 

{8:31} And he began to teach them,that the Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected of theelders, and [of] the chief priests, and scribes, and be killed, andafter three days rise again. 

{8:32} And he spake that saying openly.And Peter took him, and began to rebuke him. 

{8:33} But when he hadturned about and looked on his disciples, he rebuked Peter, saying, Getthee behind me, Satan: for thou savourest not the things that be ofGod, but the things that be of men.   

{8:34} And when he had called the people [unto him] with hisdisciples also, he said unto them, Whosoever will come after me, lethim deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me. 

{8:35} Forwhosoever will save his life shall lose it; but whosoever shall losehis life for my sake and the gospel's, the same shall save it. 

{8:36}For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, andlose his own soul? 

{8:37} Or what shall a man give in exchange for hissoul? 

{8:38} Whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me and of my wordsin this adulterous and sinful generation; of him also shall the Son ofman be ashamed, when he cometh in the glory of his Father with the holyangels.   

{9:1} And he said unto them, Verily I say unto you, That there besome of them that stand here, which shall not taste of death, till theyhave seen the kingdom of God come with power.   

{9:2} And after six days Jesus taketh [with him] Peter, and James,and John, and leadeth them up into an high mountain apart bythemselves: and he was transfigured before them. 

{9:3} And his raimentbecame shining, exceeding white as snow; so as no fuller on earth canwhite them. 

{9:4} And there appeared unto them Elias with Moses: andthey were talking with Jesus. 

{9:5} And Peter answered and said toJesus, Master, it is good for us to be here: and let us make threetabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias. 

{9:6}For he wist not what to say; for they were sore afraid. 

{9:7} And therewas a cloud that overshadowed them: and a voice came out of the cloud,saying, This is my beloved Son: hear him. 

{9:8} And suddenly, when theyhad looked round about, they saw no man any more, save Jesus only withthemselves. 

{9:9} And as they came down from the mountain, he chargedthem that they should tell no man what things they had seen, till theSon of man were risen from the dead. 

{9:10} And they kept that sayingwith themselves, questioning one with another what the rising from thedead should mean. 

{9:11} And they asked him, saying, Why say thescribes that Elias must first come? 

{9:12} And he answered and toldthem, Elias verily cometh first, and restoreth all things; and how itis written of the Son of man, that he must suffer many things, and beset at nought. 

{9:13} But I say unto you, That Elias is indeed come,and they have done unto him whatsoever they listed, as it is written ofhim.   

{9:14} And when he came to [his] disciples, he saw a great multitudeabout them, and the scribes questioning with them. 

{9:15} Andstraightway all the people, when they beheld him, were greatly amazed,and running to [him] saluted him. 

{9:16} And he asked the scribes, Whatquestion ye with them? 

{9:17} And one of the multitude answered andsaid, Master, I have brought unto thee my son, which hath a dumbspirit; 

{9:18} And wheresoever he taketh him, he teareth him: and hefoameth, and gnasheth with his teeth, and pineth away: and I spake tothy disciples that they should cast him out; and they could not. 

{9:19}He answereth him, and saith, O faithless generation, how long shall Ibe with you? how long shall I suffer you? bring him unto me. 

{9:20} Andthey brought him unto him: and when he saw him, straightway the spirittare him; and he fell on the ground, and wallowed foaming. 

{9:21} Andhe asked his father, How long is it ago since this came unto him? Andhe said, Of a child. 

{9:22} And ofttimes it hath cast him into thefire, and into the waters, to destroy him: but if thou canst do anything, have compassion on us, and help us. 

{9:23} Jesus said unto him,If thou canst believe, all things [are] possible to him that believeth.

{9:24} And straightway the father of the child cried out, and said withtears, Lord, I believe; help thou mine unbelief. 

{9:25} When Jesus sawthat the people came running together, he rebuked the foul spirit,saying unto him, [Thou] dumb and deaf spirit, I charge thee, come outof him, and enter no more into him. 

{9:26} And [the spirit] cried, andrent him sore, and came out of him: and he was as one dead; insomuchthat many said, He is dead. 

{9:27} But Jesus took him by the hand, andlifted him up; and he arose. 

{9:28} And when he was come into thehouse, his disciples asked him privately, Why could not we cast himout? 

{9:29} And he said unto them, This kind can come forth by nothing,but by prayer and fasting.   

{9:30} And they departed thence, and passed through Galilee; and hewould not that any man should know [it. ]

{9:31} For he taught hisdisciples, and said unto them, The Son of man is delivered into thehands of men, and they shall kill him; and after that he is killed, heshall rise the third day. 

{9:32} But they understood not that saying,and were afraid to ask him. 

{9:33} And he came to Capernaum: and beingin the house he asked them, What was it that ye disputed amongyourselves by the way? 

{9:34} But they held their peace: for by the waythey had disputed among themselves, who [should be] the greatest.

{9:35} And he sat down, and called the twelve, and saith unto them, Ifany man desire to be first, [the same] shall be last of all, andservant of all. 

{9:36} And he took a child, and set him in the midst ofthem: and when he had taken him in his arms, he said unto them, 

{9:37}Whosoever shall receive one of such children in my name, receiveth me:and whosoever shall receive me, receiveth not me, but him that sent me.   

{9:38} And John answered him, saying, Master, we saw one casting outdevils in thy name, and he followeth not us: and we forbad him, becausehe followeth not us. 

{9:39} But Jesus said, Forbid him not: for thereis no man which shall do a miracle in my name, that can lightly speakevil of me. 

{9:40} For he that is not against us is on our part. 

{9:41}For whosoever shall give you a cup of water to drink in my name,because ye belong to Christ, verily I say unto you, he shall not losehis reward. 

{9:42} And whosoever shall offend one of [these] littleones that believe in me, it is better for him that a millstone werehanged about his neck, and he were cast into the sea. 

{9:43} And if thyhand offend thee, cut it off: it is better for thee to enter into lifemaimed, than having two hands to go into hell, into the fire that nevershall be quenched: 

{9:44} Where their worm dieth not, and the fire isnot quenched. 

{9:45} And if thy foot offend thee, cut it off: it isbetter for thee to enter halt into life, than having two feet to becast into hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched: 

{9:46}Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched. 

{9:47} And ifthine eye offend thee, pluck it out: it is better for thee to enterinto the kingdom of God with one eye, than having two eyes to be castinto hell fire: 

{9:48} Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is notquenched. 

{9:49} For every one shall be salted with fire, and everysacrifice shall be salted with salt. 

{9:50} Salt [is] good: but if thesalt have lost his saltness, wherewith will ye season it? Have salt inyourselves, and have peace one with another.   

{10:1} And he arose from thence, and cometh into the coasts ofJudaea by the farther side of Jordan: and the people resort unto himagain; and, as he was wont, he taught them again.   

{10:2} And the Pharisees came to him, and asked him, Is it lawfulfor a man to put away [his] wife? tempting him. 

{10:3} And he answeredand said unto them, What did Moses command you? 

{10:4} And they said,Moses suffered to write a bill of divorcement, and to put [her] away.

{10:5} And Jesus answered and said unto them, For the hardness of yourheart he wrote you this precept. 

{10:6} But from the beginning of thecreation God made them male and female. 

{10:7} For this cause shall aman leave his father and mother, and cleave to his wife; 

{10:8} Andthey twain shall be one flesh: so then they are no more twain, but oneflesh. 

{10:9} What therefore God hath joined together, let not man putasunder. 

{10:10} And in the house his disciples asked him again of thesame [matter. ]

{10:11} And he saith unto them, Whosoever shall put awayhis wife, and marry another, committeth adultery against her. 

{10:12}And if a woman shall put away her husband, and be married to another,she committeth adultery.   

{10:13} And they brought young children to him, that he should touchthem: and [his] disciples rebuked those that brought [them. ]

{10:14}But when Jesus saw [it,] he was much displeased, and said unto them,Suffer the little children to come unto me, and forbid them not: for ofsuch is the kingdom of God. 

{10:15} Verily I say unto you, Whosoevershall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child, he shall notenter therein. 

{10:16} And he took them up in his arms, put [his] handsupon them, and blessed them.   

{10:17} And when he was gone forth into the way, there came onerunning, and kneeled to him, and asked him, Good Master, what shall Ido that I may inherit eternal life? 

{10:18} And Jesus said unto him,Why callest thou me good? [there is] none good but one, [that is,] God.

{10:19} Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do notkill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Defraud not, Honour thyfather and mother. 

{10:20} And he answered and said unto him, Master,all these have I observed from my youth. 

{10:21} Then Jesus beholdinghim loved him, and said unto him, One thing thou lackest: go thy way,sell whatsoever thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt havetreasure in heaven: and come, take up the cross, and follow me. 

{10:22}And he was sad at that saying, and went away grieved: for he had greatpossessions.   

{10:23} And Jesus looked round about, and saith unto his disciples,How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God!

{10:24} And the disciples were astonished at his words. But Jesusanswereth again, and saith unto them, Children, how hard is it for themthat trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of God! 

{10:25} It iseasier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a richman to enter into the kingdom of God. 

{10:26} And they were astonishedout of measure, saying among themselves, Who then can be saved? 

{10:27}And Jesus looking upon them saith, With men [it is] impossible, but notwith God: for with God all things are possible.   

{10:28} Then Peter began to say unto him, Lo, we have left all, andhave followed thee. 

{10:29} And Jesus answered and said, Verily I sayunto you, There is no man that hath left house, or brethren, orsisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for mysake, and the gospel's, 

{10:30} But he shall receive an hundredfold nowin this time, houses, and brethren, and sisters, and mothers, andchildren, and lands, with persecutions; and in the world to comeeternal life. 

{10:31} But many [that are] first shall be last; and thelast first.   

{10:32} And they were in the way going up to Jerusalem; and Jesuswent before them: and they were amazed; and as they followed, they wereafraid. And he took again the twelve, and began to tell them whatthings should happen unto him, 

{10:33} [Saying,] Behold, we go up toJerusalem; and the Son of man shall be delivered unto the chiefpriests, and unto the scribes; and they shall condemn him to death, andshall deliver him to the Gentiles: 

{10:34} And they shall mock him, andshall scourge him, and shall spit upon him, and shall kill him: and thethird day he shall rise again.   

{10:35} And James and John, the sons of Zebedee, come unto him,saying, Master, we would that thou shouldest do for us whatsoever weshall desire. 

{10:36} And he said unto them, What would ye that Ishould do for you? 

{10:37} They said unto him, Grant unto us that wemay sit, one on thy right hand, and the other on thy left hand, in thyglory. 

{10:38} But Jesus said unto them, Ye know not what ye ask: canye drink of the cup that I drink of? and be baptized with the baptismthat I am baptized with? 

{10:39} And they said unto him, We can. AndJesus said unto them, Ye shall indeed drink of the cup that I drink of;and with the baptism that I am baptized withal shall ye be baptized:

{10:40} But to sit on my right hand and on my left hand is not mine togive; but [it shall be given to them] for whom it is prepared. 

{10:41}And when the ten heard [it,] they began to be much displeased withJames and John. 

{10:42} But Jesus called them [to him,] and saith untothem, Ye know that they which are accounted to rule over the Gentilesexercise lordship over them; and their great ones exercise authorityupon them. 

{10:43} But so shall it not be among you: but whosoever willbe great among you, shall be your minister: 

{10:44} And whosoever ofyou will be the chiefest, shall be servant of all. 

{10:45} For even theSon of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to givehis life a ransom for many.   

{10:46} And they came to Jericho: and as he went out of Jericho withhis disciples and a great number of people, blind Bartimaeus, the sonof Timaeus, sat by the highway side begging. 

{10:47} And when he heardthat it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to cry out, and say, Jesus,[thou] Son of David, have mercy on me. 

{10:48} And many charged himthat he should hold his peace: but he cried the more a great deal,[Thou] Son of David, have mercy on me. 

{10:49} And Jesus stood still,and commanded him to be called. And they call the blind man, sayingunto him, Be of good comfort, rise; he calleth thee. 

{10:50} And he,casting away his garment, rose, and came to Jesus. 

{10:51} And Jesusanswered and said unto him, What wilt thou that I should do unto thee?The blind man said unto him, Lord, that I might receive my sight.

{10:52} And Jesus said unto him, Go thy way; thy faith hath made theewhole. And immediately he received his sight, and followed Jesus in theway.   

{11:1} And when they came nigh to Jerusalem, unto Bethphage andBethany, at the mount of Olives, he sendeth forth two of his disciples,

{11:2} And saith unto them, Go your way into the village over againstyou: and as soon as ye be entered into it, ye shall find a colt tied,whereon never man sat; loose him, and bring [him. ]

{11:3} And if anyman say unto you, Why do ye this? say ye that the Lord hath need ofhim; and straightway he will send him hither. 

{11:4} And they wenttheir way, and found the colt tied by the door without in a place wheretwo ways met; and they loose him. 

{11:5} And certain of them that stoodthere said unto them, What do ye, loosing the colt? 

{11:6} And theysaid unto them even as Jesus had commanded: and they let them go.

{11:7} And they brought the colt to Jesus, and cast their garments onhim; and he sat upon him. 

{11:8} And many spread their garments in theway: and others cut down branches off the trees, and strawed [them] inthe way. 

{11:9} And they that went before, and they that followed,cried, saying, Hosanna; Blessed [is] he that cometh in the name of theLord: 

{11:10} Blessed [be] the kingdom of our father David, that comethin the name of the Lord: Hosanna in the highest. 

{11:11} And Jesusentered into Jerusalem, and into the temple: and when he had lookedround about upon all things, and now the eventide was come, he went outunto Bethany with the twelve.   

{11:12} And on the morrow, when they were come from Bethany, he washungry: 

{11:13} And seeing a fig tree afar off having leaves, he came,if haply he might find any thing thereon: and when he came to it, hefound nothing but leaves; for the time of figs was not [yet. ]

{11:14}And Jesus answered and said unto it, No man eat fruit of thee hereafterfor ever. And his disciples heard [it.]   

{11:15} And they come to Jerusalem: and Jesus went into the temple,and began to cast out them that sold and bought in the temple, andoverthrew the tables of the moneychangers, and the seats of them thatsold doves; 

{11:16} And would not suffer that any man should carry[any] vessel through the temple. 

{11:17} And he taught, saying untothem, Is it not written, My house shall be called of all nations thehouse of prayer? but ye have made it a den of thieves. 

{11:18} And thescribes and chief priests heard [it,] and sought how they might destroyhim: for they feared him, because all the people was astonished at hisdoctrine. 

{11:19} And when even was come, he went out of the city.   

{11:20} And in the morning, as they passed by, they saw the fig treedried up from the roots. 

{11:21} And Peter calling to remembrance saithunto him, Master, behold, the fig tree which thou cursedst is witheredaway. 

{11:22} And Jesus answering saith unto them, Have faith in God.

{11:23} For verily I say unto you, That whosoever shall say unto thismountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; and shall notdoubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things which he saithshall come to pass; he shall have whatsoever he saith. 

{11:24}Therefore I say unto you, What things soever ye desire, when ye pray,believe that ye receive [them,] and ye shall have [them. ]

{11:25} Andwhen ye stand praying, forgive, if ye have ought against any: that yourFather also which is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses. 

{11:26}But if ye do not forgive, neither will your Father which is in heavenforgive your trespasses.   

{11:27} And they come again to Jerusalem: and as he was walking inthe temple, there come to him the chief priests, and the scribes, andthe elders, 

{11:28} And say unto him, By what authority doest thouthese things? and who gave thee this authority to do these things?

{11:29} And Jesus answered and said unto them, I will also ask of youone question, and answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I dothese things. 

{11:30} The baptism of John, was [it] from heaven, or ofmen? answer me. 

{11:31} And they reasoned with themselves, saying, Ifwe shall say, From heaven; he will say, Why then did ye not believehim? 

{11:32} But if we shall say, Of men; they feared the people: forall [men] counted John, that he was a prophet indeed. 

{11:33} And theyanswered and said unto Jesus, We cannot tell. And Jesus answering saithunto them, Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things.   

{12:1} And he began to speak unto them by parables. A [certain] manplanted a vineyard, and set an hedge about [it,] and digged [a placefor] the winefat, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, andwent into a far country. 

{12:2} And at the season he sent to thehusbandmen a servant, that he might receive from the husbandmen of thefruit of the vineyard. 

{12:3} And they caught [him,] and beat him, andsent [him] away empty. 

{12:4} And again he sent unto them anotherservant; and at him they cast stones, and wounded [him] in the head,and sent [him] away shamefully handled. 

{12:5} And again he sentanother; and him they killed, and many others; beating some, andkilling some. 

{12:6} Having yet therefore one son, his wellbeloved, hesent him also last unto them, saying, They will reverence my son.

{12:7} But those husbandmen said among themselves, This is the heir;come, let us kill him, and the inheritance shall be ours. 

{12:8} Andthey took him, and killed [him,] and cast [him] out of the vineyard.

{12:9} What shall therefore the lord of the vineyard do? he will comeand destroy the husbandmen, and will give the vineyard unto others.

{12:10} And have ye not read this scripture; The stone which thebuilders rejected is become the head of the corner: 

{12:11} This wasthe Lord's doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes? 

{12:12} And theysought to lay hold on him, but feared the people: for they knew that hehad spoken the parable against them: and they left him, and went theirway.   

{12:13} And they send unto him certain of the Pharisees and of theHerodians, to catch him in [his] words. 

{12:14} And when they werecome, they say unto him, Master, we know that thou art true, and carestfor no man: for thou regardest not the person of men, but teachest theway of God in truth: Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar, or not?

{12:15} Shall we give, or shall we not give? But he, knowing theirhypocrisy, said unto them, Why tempt ye me? bring me a penny, that Imay see [it. ]

{12:16} And they brought [it.] And he saith unto them,Whose [is] this image and superscription? And they said unto him,Caesar's. 

{12:17} And Jesus answering said unto them, Render to Caesarthe things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's. Andthey marvelled at him.   

{12:18} Then come unto him the Sadducees, which say there is noresurrection; and they asked him, saying, 

{12:19} Master, Moses wroteunto us, If a man's brother die, and leave [his] wife [behind him,] andleave no children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise upseed unto his brother. 

{12:20} Now there were seven brethren: and thefirst took a wife, and dying left no seed. 

{12:21} And the second tookher, and died, neither left he any seed: and the third likewise.

{12:22} And the seven had her, and left no seed: last of all the womandied also. 

{12:23} In the resurrection therefore, when they shall rise,whose wife shall she be of them? for the seven had her to wife. 

{12:24}And Jesus answering said unto them, Do ye not therefore err, because yeknow not the scriptures, neither the power of God? 

{12:25} For whenthey shall rise from the dead, they neither marry, nor are given inmarriage; but are as the angels which are in heaven. 

{12:26} And astouching the dead, that they rise: have ye not read in the book ofMoses, how in the bush God spake unto him, saying, I [am] the God ofAbraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? 

{12:27} He is notthe God of the dead, but the God of the living: ye therefore do greatlyerr.   

{12:28} And one of the scribes came, and having heard them reasoningtogether, and perceiving that he had answered them well, asked him,Which is the first commandment of all? 

{12:29} And Jesus answered him,The first of all the commandments [is,] Hear, O Israel; The Lord ourGod is one Lord: 

{12:30} And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with allthy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with allthy strength: this is the first commandment. 

{12:31} And the second[is] like, [namely] this, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.There is none other commandment greater than these. 

{12:32} And thescribe said unto him, Well, Master, thou hast said the truth: for thereis one God; and there is none other but he: 

{12:33} And to love himwith all the heart, and with all the understanding, and with all thesoul, and with all the strength, and to love [his] neighbour ashimself, is more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices. 

{12:34}And when Jesus saw that he answered discreetly, he said unto him, Thouart not far from the kingdom of God. And no man after that durst askhim [any question.]   

{12:35} And Jesus answered and said, while he taught in the temple,How say the scribes that Christ is the Son of David? 

{12:36} For Davidhimself said by the Holy Ghost, The Lord said to my Lord, Sit thou onmy right hand, till I make thine enemies thy footstool. 

{12:37} Davidtherefore himself calleth him Lord; and whence is he [then] his son?And the common people heard him gladly.   

{12:38} And he said unto them in his doctrine, Beware of thescribes, which love to go in long clothing, and [love] salutations inthe marketplaces, 

{12:39} And the chief seats in the synagogues, andthe uppermost rooms at feasts: 

{12:40} Which devour widows' houses, andfor a pretence make long prayers: these shall receive greater damnation.   

{12:41} And Jesus sat over against the treasury, and beheld how thepeople cast money into the treasury: and many that were rich cast inmuch. 

{12:42} And there came a certain poor widow, and she threw in twomites, which make a farthing. 

{12:43} And he called [unto him] hisdisciples, and saith unto them, Verily I say unto you, That this poorwidow hath cast more in, than all they which have cast into thetreasury: 

{12:44} For all [they] did cast in of their abundance; butshe of her want did cast in all that she had, [even] all her living.   

{13:1} And as he went out of the temple, one of his disciples saithunto him, Master, see what manner of stones and what buildings [arehere! ]

{13:2} And Jesus answering said unto him, Seest thou these greatbuildings? there shall not be left one stone upon another, that shallnot be thrown down. 

{13:3} And as he sat upon the mount of Olives overagainst the temple, Peter and James and John and Andrew asked himprivately, 

{13:4} Tell us, when shall these things be? and what [shallbe] the sign when all these things shall be fulfilled? 

{13:5} And Jesusanswering them began to say, Take heed lest any [man] deceive you:

{13:6} For many shall come in my name, saying, I am [Christ;] and shalldeceive many. 

{13:7} And when ye shall hear of wars and rumours ofwars, be ye not troubled: for [such things] must needs be; but the end[shall] not [be] yet. 

{13:8} For nation shall rise against nation, andkingdom against kingdom: and there shall be earthquakes in diversplaces, and there shall be famines and troubles: these [are] thebeginnings of sorrows.   

{13:9} But take heed to yourselves: for they shall deliver you up tocouncils; and in the synagogues ye shall be beaten: and ye shall bebrought before rulers and kings for my sake, for a testimony againstthem. 

{13:10} And the gospel must first be published among all nations.

{13:11} But when they shall lead [you,] and deliver you up, take nothought beforehand what ye shall speak, neither do ye premeditate: butwhatsoever shall be given you in that hour, that speak ye: for it isnot ye that speak, but the Holy Ghost. 

{13:12} Now the brother shallbetray the brother to death, and the father the son; and children shallrise up against [their] parents, and shall cause them to be put todeath. 

{13:13} And ye shall be hated of all [men] for my name's sake:but he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.   

{13:14} But when ye shall see the abomination of desolation, spokenof by Daniel the prophet, standing where it ought not, (let him thatreadeth understand,) then let them that be in Judaea flee to themountains: 

{13:15} And let him that is on the housetop not go down intothe house, neither enter [therein,] to take any thing out of his house:

{13:16} And let him that is in the field not turn back again for totake up his garment. 

{13:17} But woe to them that are with child, andto them that give suck in those days! 

{13:18} And pray ye that yourflight be not in the winter. 

{13:19} For [in] those days shall beaffliction, such as was not from the beginning of the creation whichGod created unto this time, neither shall be. 

{13:20} And except thatthe Lord had shortened those days, no flesh should be saved: but forthe elect's sake, whom he hath chosen, he hath shortened the days.

{13:21} And then if any man shall say to you, Lo, here [is] Christ; or,lo, [he is] there; believe [him] not: 

{13:22} For false Christs andfalse prophets shall rise, and shall shew signs and wonders, to seduce,if [it were] possible, even the elect. 

{13:23} But take ye heed:behold, I have foretold you all things.   

{13:24} But in those days, after that tribulation, the sun shall bedarkened, and the moon shall not give her light, 

{13:25} And the starsof heaven shall fall, and the powers that are in heaven shall beshaken. 

{13:26} And then shall they see the Son of man coming in theclouds with great power and glory. 

{13:27} And then shall he send hisangels, and shall gather together his elect from the four winds, fromthe uttermost part of the earth to the uttermost part of heaven.

{13:28} Now learn a parable of the fig tree; When her branch is yettender, and putteth forth leaves, ye know that summer is near: 

{13:29}So ye in like manner, when ye shall see these things come to pass, knowthat it is nigh, [even] at the doors. 

{13:30} Verily I say unto you,that this generation shall not pass, till all these things be done.

{13:31} Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not passaway.   

{13:32} But of that day and [that] hour knoweth no man, no, not theangels which are in heaven, neither the Son, but the Father. 

{13:33}Take ye heed, watch and pray: for ye know not when the time is. 

{13:34}[For the Son of man is] as a man taking a far journey, who left hishouse, and gave authority to his servants, and to every man his work,and commanded the porter to watch. 

{13:35} Watch ye therefore: for yeknow not when the master of the house cometh, at even, or at midnight,or at the cockcrowing, or in the morning: 

{13:36} Lest coming suddenlyhe find you sleeping. 

{13:37} And what I say unto you I say unto all,Watch.   

{14:1} After two days was [the feast of] the passover, and ofunleavened bread: and the chief priests and the scribes sought how theymight take him by craft, and put [him] to death. 

{14:2} But they said,Not on the feast [day,] lest there be an uproar of the people.   

{14:3} And being in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, as hesat at meat, there came a woman having an alabaster box of ointment ofspikenard very precious; and she brake the box, and poured [it] on hishead. 

{14:4} And there were some that had indignation withinthemselves, and said, Why was this waste of the ointment made? 

{14:5}For it might have been sold for more than three hundred pence, and havebeen given to the poor. And they murmured against her. 

{14:6} And Jesussaid, Let her alone; why trouble ye her? she hath wrought a good workon me. 

{14:7} For ye have the poor with you always, and whensoever yewill ye may do them good: but me ye have not always. 

{14:8} She hathdone what she could: she is come aforehand to anoint my body to theburying. 

{14:9} Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall bepreached throughout the whole world, [this] also that she hath doneshall be spoken of for a memorial of her.   

{14:10} And Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went unto the chiefpriests, to betray him unto them. 

{14:11} And when they heard [it,]they were glad, and promised to give him money. And he sought how hemight conveniently betray him.   

{14:12} And the first day of unleavened bread, when they killed thepassover, his disciples said unto him, Where wilt thou that we go andprepare that thou mayest eat the passover? 

{14:13} And he sendeth forthtwo of his disciples, and saith unto them, Go ye into the city, andthere shall meet you a man bearing a pitcher of water: follow him.

{14:14} And wheresoever he shall go in, say ye to the goodman of thehouse, The Master saith, Where is the guestchamber, where I shall eatthe passover with my disciples? 

{14:15} And he will shew you a largeupper room furnished [and] prepared: there make ready for us. 

{14:16}And his disciples went forth, and came into the city, and found as hehad said unto them: and they made ready the passover. 

{14:17} And inthe evening he cometh with the twelve. 

{14:18} And as they sat and dideat, Jesus said, Verily I say unto you, One of you which eateth with meshall betray me. 

{14:19} And they began to be sorrowful, and to sayunto him one by one, [Is] it I? and another [said, Is] it I? 

{14:20}And he answered and said unto them, [It is] one of the twelve, thatdippeth with me in the dish. 

{14:21} The Son of man indeed goeth, as itis written of him: but woe to that man by whom the Son of man isbetrayed! good were it for that man if he had never been born.   

{14:22} And as they did eat, Jesus took bread, and blessed, andbrake [it,] and gave to them, and said, Take, eat: this is my body.

{14:23} And he took the cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave [it]to them: and they all drank of it. 

{14:24} And he said unto them, Thisis my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many. 

{14:25}Verily I say unto you, I will drink no more of the fruit of the vine,until that day that I drink it new in the kingdom of God.   

{14:26} And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mountof Olives. 

{14:27} And Jesus saith unto them, All ye shall be offendedbecause of me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd,and the sheep shall be scattered. 

{14:28} But after that I am risen, Iwill go before you into Galilee. 

{14:29} But Peter said unto him,Although all shall be offended, yet [will] not I. 

{14:30} And Jesussaith unto him, Verily I say unto thee, That this day, [even] in thisnight, before the cock crow twice, thou shalt deny me thrice. 

{14:31}But he spake the more vehemently, If I should die with thee, I will notdeny thee in any wise. Likewise also said they all. 

{14:32} And theycame to a place which was named Gethsemane: and he saith to hisdisciples, Sit ye here, while I shall pray. 

{14:33} And he taketh withhim Peter and James and John, and began to be sore amazed, and to bevery heavy; 

{14:34} And saith unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowfulunto death: tarry ye here, and watch. 

{14:35} And he went forward alittle, and fell on the ground, and prayed that, if it were possible,the hour might pass from him. 

{14:36} And he said, Abba, Father, allthings [are] possible unto thee; take away this cup from me:nevertheless not what I will, but what thou wilt. 

{14:37} And hecometh, and findeth them sleeping, and saith unto Peter, Simon,sleepest thou? couldest not thou watch one hour? 

{14:38} Watch ye andpray, lest ye enter into temptation. The spirit truly [is] ready, butthe flesh [is] weak. 

{14:39} And again he went away, and prayed, andspake the same words. 

{14:40} And when he returned, he found themasleep again, (for their eyes were heavy,) neither wist they what toanswer him. 

{14:41} And he cometh the third time, and saith unto them,Sleep on now, and take [your] rest: it is enough, the hour is come;behold, the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners. 

{14:42}Rise up, let us go; lo, he that betrayeth me is at hand.   

{14:43} And immediately, while he yet spake, cometh Judas, one ofthe twelve, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, fromthe chief priest and the scribes and the elders. 

{14:44} And he thatbetrayed him had given them a token, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss,that same is he; take him, and lead [him] away safely. 

{14:45} And assoon as he was come, he goeth straightway to him, and saith, Master,master; and kissed him.   

{14:46} And they laid their hands on him, and took him. 

{14:47} Andone of them that stood by drew a sword, and smote a servant of the highpriest, and cut off his ear. 

{14:48} And Jesus answered and said untothem, Are ye come out, as against a thief, with swords and [with]staves to take me? 

{14:49} I was daily with you in the temple teaching,and ye took me not: but the scriptures must be fulfilled. 

{14:50} Andthey all forsook him, and fled. 

{14:51} And there followed him acertain young man, having a linen cloth cast about [his] naked [body;]and the young men laid hold on him: 

{14:52} And he left the linencloth, and fled from them naked.   

{14:53} And they led Jesus away to the high priest: and with himwere assembled all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes.

{14:54} And Peter followed him afar off, even into the palace of thehigh priest: and he sat with the servants, and warmed himself at thefire. 

{14:55} And the chief priests and all the council sought forwitness against Jesus to put him to death; and found none. 

{14:56} Formany bare false witness against him, but their witness agreed nottogether. 

{14:57} And there arose certain, and bare false witnessagainst him, saying, 

{14:58} We heard him say, I will destroy thistemple that is made with hands, and within three days I will buildanother made without hands. 

{14:59} But neither so did their witnessagree together. 

{14:60} And the high priest stood up in the midst, andasked Jesus, saying, Answerest thou nothing? what [is it which] thesewitness against thee? 

{14:61} But he held his peace, and answerednothing. Again the high priest asked him, and said unto him, Art thouthe Christ, the Son of the Blessed? 

{14:62} And Jesus said, I am: andye shall see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, andcoming in the clouds of heaven. 

{14:63} Then the high priest rent hisclothes, and saith, What need we any further witnesses? 

{14:64} Ye haveheard the blasphemy: what think ye? And they all condemned him to beguilty of death. 

{14:65} And some began to spit on him, and to coverhis face, and to buffet him, and to say unto him, Prophesy: and theservants did strike him with the palms of their hands.   

{14:66} And as Peter was beneath in the palace, there cometh one ofthe maids of the high priest: 

{14:67} And when she saw Peter warminghimself, she looked upon him, and said, And thou also wast with Jesusof Nazareth. 

{14:68} But he denied, saying, I know not, neitherunderstand I what thou sayest. And he went out into the porch; and thecock crew. 

{14:69} And a maid saw him again, and began to say to themthat stood by, This is [one] of them. 

{14:70} And he denied it again.And a little after, they that stood by said again to Peter, Surely thouart [one] of them: for thou art a Galilaean, and thy speech agreeth[thereto. ]

{14:71} But he began to curse and to swear, [saying,] I knownot this man of whom ye speak. 

{14:72} And the second time the cockcrew. And Peter called to mind the word that Jesus said unto him,Before the cock crow twice, thou shalt deny me thrice. And when hethought thereon, he wept.   

{15:1} And straightway in the morning the chief priests held aconsultation with the elders and scribes and the whole council, andbound Jesus, and carried [him] away, and delivered [him] to Pilate.

{15:2} And Pilate asked him, Art thou the King of the Jews? And heanswering said unto him, Thou sayest [it. ]

{15:3} And the chief priestsaccused him of many things: but he answered nothing. 

{15:4} And Pilateasked him again, saying, Answerest thou nothing? behold how many thingsthey witness against thee. 

{15:5} But Jesus yet answered nothing; sothat Pilate marvelled. 

{15:6} Now at [that] feast he released unto themone prisoner, whomsoever they desired. 

{15:7} And there was [one] namedBarabbas, [which lay] bound with them that had made insurrection withhim, who had committed murder in the insurrection. 

{15:8} And themultitude crying aloud began to desire [him to do] as he had ever doneunto them. 

{15:9} But Pilate answered them, saying, Will ye that Irelease unto you the King of the Jews? 

{15:10} For he knew that thechief priests had delivered him for envy. 

{15:11} But the chief priestsmoved the people, that he should rather release Barabbas unto them.

{15:12} And Pilate answered and said again unto them, What will ye thenthat I shall do [unto him] whom ye call the King of the Jews? 

{15:13}And they cried out again, Crucify him. 

{15:14} Then Pilate said untothem, Why, what evil hath he done? And they cried out the moreexceedingly, Crucify him.   

{15:15} And [so] Pilate, willing to content the people, releasedBarabbas unto them, and delivered Jesus, when he had scourged [him,] tobe crucified. 

{15:16} And the soldiers led him away into the hall,called Praetorium; and they call together the whole band. 

{15:17} Andthey clothed him with purple, and platted a crown of thorns, and put itabout his [head, ]

{15:18} And began to salute him, Hail, King of theJews! 

{15:19} And they smote him on the head with a reed, and did spitupon him, and bowing [their] knees worshipped him. 

{15:20} And whenthey had mocked him, they took off the purple from him, and put his ownclothes on him, and led him out to crucify him. 

{15:21} And they compelone Simon a Cyrenian, who passed by, coming out of the country, thefather of Alexander and Rufus, to bear his cross. 

{15:22} And theybring him unto the place Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, Theplace of a skull. 

{15:23} And they gave him to drink wine mingled withmyrrh: but he received [it] not. 

{15:24} And when they had crucifiedhim, they parted his garments, casting lots upon them, what every manshould take. 

{15:25} And it was the third hour, and they crucified him.

{15:26} And the superscription of his accusation was written over, THEKING OF THE JEWS. 

{15:27} And with him they crucify two thieves; theone on his right hand, and the other on his left. 

{15:28} And thescripture was fulfilled, which saith, And he was numbered with thetransgressors. 

{15:29} And they that passed by railed on him, waggingtheir heads, and saying, Ah, thou that destroyest the temple, andbuildest [it] in three days, 

{15:30} Save thyself, and come down fromthe cross. 

{15:31} Likewise also the chief priests mocking said amongthemselves with the scribes, He saved others; himself he cannot save.

{15:32} Let Christ the King of Israel descend now from the cross, thatwe may see and believe. And they that were crucified with him reviledhim. 

{15:33} And when the sixth hour was come, there was darkness overthe whole land until the ninth hour. 

{15:34} And at the ninth hourJesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?which is, being interpreted, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?

{15:35} And some of them that stood by, when they heard [it,] said,Behold, he calleth Elias. 

{15:36} And one ran and filled a spunge fullof vinegar, and put [it] on a reed, and gave him to drink, saying, Letalone; let us see whether Elias will come to take him down. 

{15:37} AndJesus cried with a loud voice, and gave up the ghost. 

{15:38} And theveil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom.   

{15:39} And when the centurion, which stood over against him, sawthat he so cried out, and gave up the ghost, he said, Truly this manwas the Son of God. 

{15:40} There were also women looking on afar off:among whom was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the lessand of Joses, and Salome; 

{15:41} (Who also, when he was in Galilee,followed him, and ministered unto him;) and many other women which cameup with him unto Jerusalem.   

{15:42} And now when the even was come, because it was thepreparation, that is, the day before the sabbath, 

{15:43} Joseph ofArimathaea, an honourable counsellor, which also waited for the kingdomof God, came, and went in boldly unto Pilate, and craved the body ofJesus. 

{15:44} And Pilate marvelled if he were already dead: andcalling [unto him] the centurion, he asked him whether he had been anywhile dead. 

{15:45} And when he knew [it] of the centurion, he gave thebody to Joseph. 

{15:46} And he bought fine linen, and took him down,and wrapped him in the linen, and laid him in a sepulchre which washewn out of a rock, and rolled a stone unto the door of the sepulchre.

{15:47} And Mary Magdalene and Mary [the mother] of Joses beheld wherehe was laid.   

{16:1} And when the sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the[mother] of James, and Salome, had bought sweet spices, that they mightcome and anoint him. 

{16:2} And very early in the morning the first[day] of the week, they came unto the sepulchre at the rising of thesun. 

{16:3} And they said among themselves, Who shall roll us away thestone from the door of the sepulchre? 

{16:4} And when they looked, theysaw that the stone was rolled away: for it was very great. 

{16:5} Andentering into the sepulchre, they saw a young man sitting on the rightside, clothed in a long white garment; and they were affrighted. 

{16:6}And he saith unto them, Be not affrighted: Ye seek Jesus of Nazareth,which was crucified: he is risen; he is not here: behold the placewhere they laid him. 

{16:7} But go your way, tell his disciples andPeter that he goeth before you into Galilee: there shall ye see him, ashe said unto you. 

{16:8} And they went out quickly, and fled from thesepulchre; for they trembled and were amazed: neither said they anything to any [man;] for they were afraid.   

{16:9} Now when [Jesus] was risen early the first [day] of the week,he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, out of whom he had cast sevendevils. 

{16:10} [And] she went and told them that had been with him, asthey mourned and wept. 

{16:11} And they, when they had heard that hewas alive, and had been seen of her, believed not.   

{16:12} After that he appeared in another form unto two of them, asthey walked, and went into the country. 

{16:13} And they went and told[it] unto the residue: neither believed they them.   

{16:14} Afterward he appeared unto the eleven as they sat at meat,and upbraided them with their unbelief and hardness of heart, becausethey believed not them which had seen him after he was risen. 

{16:15}And he said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospelto every creature. 

{16:16} He that believeth and is baptized shall besaved; but he that believeth not shall be damned. 

{16:17} And thesesigns shall follow them that believe; In my name shall they cast outdevils; they shall speak with new tongues; 

{16:18} They shall take upserpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them;they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover.   

{16:19} So then after the Lord had spoken unto them, he was receivedup into heaven, and sat on the right hand of God. 

{16:20} And they wentforth, and preached every where, the Lord working with [them,] andconfirming the word with signs following. Amen.
