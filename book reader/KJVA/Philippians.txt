{The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians   

{1:1} Paul and Timotheus, the servants of Jesus Christ, to all thesaints in Christ Jesus which are at Philippi, with the bishops anddeacons: 

{1:2} Grace [be] unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and[from] the Lord Jesus Christ. 

{1:3} I thank my God upon everyremembrance of you, 

{1:4} Always in every prayer of mine for you allmaking request with joy, 

{1:5} For your fellowship in the gospel fromthe first day until now; 

{1:6} Being confident of this very thing, thathe which hath begun a good work in you will perform [it] until the dayof Jesus Christ: 

{1:7} Even as it is meet for me to think this of youall, because I have you in my heart; inasmuch as both in my bonds, andin the defence and confirmation of the gospel, ye all are partakers ofmy grace. 

{1:8} For God is my record, how greatly I long after you allin the bowels of Jesus Christ. 

{1:9} And this I pray, that your lovemay abound yet more and more in knowledge and [in] all judgment; 

{1:10}That ye may approve things that are excellent; that ye may be sincereand without offence till the day of Christ; 

{1:11} Being filled withthe fruits of righteousness, which are by Jesus Christ, unto the gloryand praise of God.   

{1:12} But I would ye should understand, brethren, that the things[which happened] unto me have fallen out rather unto the furtherance ofthe gospel; 

{1:13} So that my bonds in Christ are manifest in all thepalace, and in all other [places; ]

{1:14} And many of the brethren inthe Lord, waxing confident by my bonds, are much more bold to speak theword without fear. 

{1:15} Some indeed preach Christ even of envy andstrife; and some also of good will: 

{1:16} The one preach Christ ofcontention, not sincerely, supposing to add affliction to my bonds:

{1:17} But the other of love, knowing that I am set for the defence ofthe gospel. 

{1:18} What then? notwithstanding, every way, whether inpretence, or in truth, Christ is preached; and I therein do rejoice,yea, and will rejoice. 

{1:19} For I know that this shall turn to mysalvation through your prayer, and the supply of the Spirit of JesusChrist, 

{1:20} According to my earnest expectation and [my] hope, thatin nothing I shall be ashamed, but [that] with all boldness, as always,[so] now also Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether [it be] bylife, or by death. 

{1:21} For to me to live [is] Christ, and to die[is] gain. 

{1:22} But if I live in the flesh, this [is] the fruit of mylabour: yet what I shall choose I wot not. 

{1:23} For I am in a straitbetwixt two, having a desire to depart, and to be with Christ; which isfar better: 

{1:24} Nevertheless to abide in the flesh [is] more needfulfor you. 

{1:25} And having this confidence, I know that I shall abideand continue with you all for your furtherance and joy of faith; 

{1:26}That your rejoicing may be more abundant in Jesus Christ for me by mycoming to you again. 

{1:27} Only let your conversation be as itbecometh the gospel of Christ: that whether I come and see you, or elsebe absent, I may hear of your affairs, that ye stand fast in onespirit, with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel;

{1:28} And in nothing terrified by your adversaries: which is to theman evident token of perdition, but to you of salvation, and that ofGod. 

{1:29} For unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ, not onlyto believe on him, but also to suffer for his sake; 

{1:30} Having thesame conflict which ye saw in me, and now hear [to be] in me.   

{2:1} If [there be] therefore any consolation in Christ, if anycomfort of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any bowels andmercies, 

{2:2} Fulfil ye my joy, that ye be likeminded, having the samelove, [being] of one accord, of one mind. 

{2:3} [Let] nothing [be done]through strife or vainglory; but in lowliness of mind let each esteemother better than themselves. 

{2:4} Look not every man on his ownthings, but every man also on the things of others. 

{2:5} Let this mindbe in you, which was also in Christ Jesus: 

{2:6} Who, being in the formof God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God: 

{2:7} But madehimself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, andwas made in the likeness of men: 

{2:8} And being found in fashion as aman, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the deathof the cross. 

{2:9} Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, andgiven him a name which is above every name: 

{2:10} That at the name ofJesus every knee should bow, of [things] in heaven, and [things] inearth, and [things] under the earth; 

{2:11} And [that] every tongueshould confess that Jesus Christ [is] Lord, to the glory of God theFather.   

{2:12} Wherefore, my beloved, as ye have always obeyed, not as in mypresence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your ownsalvation with fear and trembling. 

{2:13} For it is God which workethin you both to will and to do of [his] good pleasure. 

{2:14} Do allthings without murmurings and disputings: 

{2:15} That ye may beblameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the midstof a crooked and perverse nation, among whom ye shine as lights in theworld; 

{2:16} Holding forth the word of life; that I may rejoice in theday of Christ, that I have not run in vain, neither laboured in vain.

{2:17} Yea, and if I be offered upon the sacrifice and service of yourfaith, I joy, and rejoice with you all. 

{2:18} For the same cause alsodo ye joy, and rejoice with me.   

{2:19} But I trust in the Lord Jesus to send Timotheus shortly untoyou, that I also may be of good comfort, when I know your state. 

{2:20}For I have no man likeminded, who will naturally care for your state.

{2:21} For all seek their own, not the things which are Jesus Christ's.

{2:22} But ye know the proof of him, that, as a son with the father, hehath served with me in the gospel. 

{2:23} Him therefore I hope to sendpresently, so soon as I shall see how it will go with me. 

{2:24} But Itrust in the Lord that I also myself shall come shortly. 

{2:25} Yet Isupposed it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother, andcompanion in labour, and fellow soldier, but your messenger, and hethat ministered to my wants. 

{2:26} For he longed after you all, andwas full of heaviness, because that ye had heard that he had been sick.

{2:27} For indeed he was sick nigh unto death: but God had mercy onhim; and not on him only, but on me also, lest I should have sorrowupon sorrow. 

{2:28} I sent him therefore the more carefully, that, whenye see him again, ye may rejoice, and that I may be the less sorrowful.

{2:29} Receive him therefore in the Lord with all gladness; and holdsuch in reputation: 

{2:30} Because for the work of Christ he was nighunto death, not regarding his life, to supply your lack of servicetoward me.   

{3:1} Finally, my brethren, rejoice in the Lord. To write the samethings to you, to me indeed [is] not grievous, but for you [it is] safe.   

{3:2} Beware of dogs, beware of evil workers, beware of theconcision. 

{3:3} For we are the circumcision, which worship God in thespirit, and rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in theflesh. 

{3:4} Though I might also have confidence in the flesh. If anyother man thinketh that he hath whereof he might trust in the flesh, Imore: 

{3:5} Circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of Israel, [of]the tribe of Benjamin, an Hebrew of the Hebrews; as touching the law, aPharisee; 

{3:6} Concerning zeal, persecuting the church; touching therighteousness which is in the law, blameless. 

{3:7} But what thingswere gain to me, those I counted loss for Christ. 

{3:8} Yea doubtless,and I count all things [but] loss for the excellency of the knowledgeof Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom I have suffered the loss of allthings, and do count them [but] dung, that I may win Christ, 

{3:9} Andbe found in him, not having mine own righteousness, which is of thelaw, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousnesswhich is of God by faith: 

{3:10} That I may know him, and the power ofhis resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, being madeconformable unto his death; 

{3:11} If by any means I might attain untothe resurrection of the dead. 

{3:12} Not as though I had alreadyattained, either were already perfect: but I follow after, if that Imay apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus.

{3:13} Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended: but [this] onething [I do,] forgetting those things which are behind, and reachingforth unto those things which are before, 

{3:14} I press toward themark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus. 

{3:15}Let us therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus minded: and if in anything ye be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this unto you.

{3:16} Nevertheless, whereto we have already attained, let us walk bythe same rule, let us mind the same thing. 

{3:17} Brethren, befollowers together of me, and mark them which walk so as ye have us foran ensample. 

{3:18} (For many walk, of whom I have told you often, andnow tell you even weeping, [that they are] the enemies of the cross ofChrist: 

{3:19} Whose end [is] destruction, whose God [is their] belly,and [whose] glory [is] in their shame, who mind earthly things.) 

{3:20}For our conversation is in heaven; from whence also we look for theSaviour, the Lord Jesus Christ: 

{3:21} Who shall change our vile body,that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body, according to theworking whereby he is able even to subdue all things unto himself.   

{4:1} Therefore, my brethren dearly beloved and longed for, my joyand crown, so stand fast in the Lord, [my] dearly beloved. 

{4:2} Ibeseech Euodias, and beseech Syntyche, that they be of the same mind inthe Lord. 

{4:3} And I intreat thee also, true yokefellow, help thosewomen which laboured with me in the gospel, with Clement also, and[with] other my fellowlabourers, whose names [are] in the book of life.

{4:4} Rejoice in the Lord alway: [and] again I say, Rejoice. 

{4:5} Letyour moderation be known unto all men. The Lord [is] at hand. 

{4:6} Becareful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and supplication withthanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God. 

{4:7} And thepeace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your heartsand minds through Christ Jesus. 

{4:8} Finally, brethren, whatsoeverthings are true, whatsoever things [are] honest, whatsoever things[are] just, whatsoever things [are] pure, whatsoever things [are]lovely, whatsoever things [are] of good report; if [there be] anyvirtue, and if [there be] any praise, think on these things. 

{4:9}Those things, which ye have both learned, and received, and heard, andseen in me, do: and the God of peace shall be with you.   

{4:10} But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, that now at the last yourcare of me hath flourished again; wherein ye were also careful, but yelacked opportunity. 

{4:11} Not that I speak in respect of want: for Ihave learned, in whatsoever state I am, [therewith] to be content.

{4:12} I know both how to be abased, and I know how to abound: everywhere and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to behungry, both to abound and to suffer need. 

{4:13} I can do all thingsthrough Christ which strengtheneth me. 

{4:14} Notwithstanding ye havewell done, that ye did communicate with my affliction. 

{4:15} Now yePhilippians know also, that in the beginning of the gospel, when Ideparted from Macedonia, no church communicated with me as concerninggiving and receiving, but ye only. 

{4:16} For even in Thessalonica yesent once and again unto my necessity. 

{4:17} Not because I desire agift: but I desire fruit that may abound to your account. 

{4:18} But Ihave all, and abound: I am full, having received of Epaphroditus thethings [which were sent] from you, an odour of a sweet smell, asacrifice acceptable, wellpleasing to God. 

{4:19} But my God shallsupply all your need according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus.

{4:20} Now unto God and our Father [be] glory for ever and ever. Amen.   

{4:21} Salute every saint in Christ Jesus. The brethren which arewith me greet you. 

{4:22} All the saints salute you, chiefly they thatare of Caesar's household.   

{4:23} The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ [be] with you all. Amen.
