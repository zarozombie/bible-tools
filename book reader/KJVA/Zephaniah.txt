{Zephaniah   

{1:1} The word of the LORD which came unto Zephaniah the son ofCushi, the son of Gedaliah, the son of Amariah, the son of Hizkiah, inthe days of Josiah the son of Amon, king of Judah. 

{1:2} I will utterlyconsume all [things] from off the land, saith the LORD. 

{1:3} I willconsume man and beast; I will consume the fowls of the heaven, and thefishes of the sea, and the stumblingblocks with the wicked; and I willcut off man from off the land, saith the LORD. 

{1:4} I will alsostretch out mine hand upon Judah, and upon all the inhabitants ofJerusalem; and I will cut off the remnant of Baal from this place,[and] the name of the Chemarims with the priests; 

{1:5} And them thatworship the host of heaven upon the housetops; and them that worship[and] that swear by the LORD, and that swear by Malcham; 

{1:6} And themthat are turned back from the LORD; and [those] that have not soughtthe LORD, nor enquired for him. 

{1:7} Hold thy peace at the presence ofthe Lord GOD: for the day of the LORD [is] at hand: for the LORD hathprepared a sacrifice, he hath bid his guests. 

{1:8} And it shall cometo pass in the day of the LORD'S sacrifice, that I will punish theprinces, and the king's children, and all such as are clothed withstrange apparel. 

{1:9} In the same day also will I punish all thosethat leap on the threshold, which fill their masters' houses withviolence and deceit. 

{1:10} And it shall come to pass in that day,saith the LORD, [that there shall be] the noise of a cry from the fishgate, and an howling from the second, and a great crashing from thehills. 

{1:11} Howl, ye inhabitants of Maktesh, for all the merchantpeople are cut down; all they that bear silver are cut off. 

{1:12} Andit shall come to pass at that time, [that] I will search Jerusalem withcandles, and punish the men that are settled on their lees: that say intheir heart, The LORD will not do good, neither will he do evil. 

{1:13}Therefore their goods shall become a booty, and their houses adesolation: they shall also build houses, but not inhabit [them;] andthey shall plant vineyards, but not drink the wine thereof. 

{1:14} Thegreat day of the LORD [is] near, [it is] near, and hasteth greatly,[even] the voice of the day of the LORD: the mighty man shall cry therebitterly. 

{1:15} That day [is] a day of wrath, a day of trouble anddistress, a day of wasteness and desolation, a day of darkness andgloominess, a day of clouds and thick darkness, 

{1:16} A day of thetrumpet and alarm against the fenced cities, and against the hightowers. 

{1:17} And I will bring distress upon men, that they shall walklike blind men, because they have sinned against the LORD: and theirblood shall be poured out as dust, and their flesh as the dung. 

{1:18}Neither their silver nor their gold shall be able to deliver them inthe day of the LORD'S wrath; but the whole land shall be devoured bythe fire of his jealousy: for he shall make even a speedy riddance ofall them that dwell in the land.   

{2:1} Gather yourselves together, yea, gather together, O nation notdesired; 

{2:2} Before the decree bring forth, [before] the day pass asthe chaff, before the fierce anger of the LORD come upon you, beforethe day of the LORD'S anger come upon you. 

{2:3} Seek ye the LORD, allye meek of the earth, which have wrought his judgment; seekrighteousness, seek meekness: it may be ye shall be hid in the day ofthe LORD'S anger.   

{2:4} For Gaza shall be forsaken, and Ashkelon a desolation: theyshall drive out Ashdod at the noonday, and Ekron shall be rooted up.

{2:5} Woe unto the inhabitants of the sea coast, the nation of theCherethites! the word of the LORD [is] against you; O Canaan, the landof the Philistines, I will even destroy thee, that there shall be noinhabitant. 

{2:6} And the sea coast shall be dwellings [and] cottagesfor shepherds, and folds for flocks. 

{2:7} And the coast shall be forthe remnant of the house of Judah; they shall feed thereupon: in thehouses of Ashkelon shall they lie down in the evening: for the LORDtheir God shall visit them, and turn away their captivity.   

{2:8} I have heard the reproach of Moab, and the revilings of thechildren of Ammon, whereby they have reproached my people, andmagnified [themselves] against their border. 

{2:9} Therefore [as] Ilive, saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, Surely Moab shall beas Sodom, and the children of Ammon as Gomorrah, [even] the breeding ofnettles, and saltpits, and a perpetual desolation: the residue of mypeople shall spoil them, and the remnant of my people shall possessthem. 

{2:10} This shall they have for their pride, because they havereproached and magnified [themselves] against the people of the LORD ofhosts. 

{2:11} The LORD [will be] terrible unto them: for he will famishall the gods of the earth; and [men] shall worship him, every one fromhis place, [even] all the isles of the heathen.   

{2:12} Ye Ethiopians also, ye [shall be] slain by my sword. 

{2:13}And he will stretch out his hand against the north, and destroyAssyria; and will make Nineveh a desolation, [and] dry like awilderness. 

{2:14} And flocks shall lie down in the midst of her, allthe beasts of the nations: both the cormorant and the bittern shalllodge in the upper lintels of it; [their] voice shall sing in thewindows; desolation [shall be] in the thresholds: for he shall uncoverthe cedar work. 

{2:15} This [is] the rejoicing city that dweltcarelessly, that said in her heart, I [am,] and [there is] none besideme: how is she become a desolation, a place for beasts to lie down in!every one that passeth by her shall hiss, [and] wag his hand.   

{3:1} Woe to her that is filthy and polluted, to the oppressingcity! 

{3:2} She obeyed not the voice; she received not correction; shetrusted not in the LORD; she drew not near to her God. 

{3:3} Herprinces within her [are] roaring lions; her judges [are] eveningwolves; they gnaw not the bones till the morrow. 

{3:4} Her prophets[are] light [and] treacherous persons: her priests have polluted thesanctuary, they have done violence to the law. 

{3:5} The just LORD [is]in the midst thereof; he will not do iniquity: every morning doth hebring his judgment to light, he faileth not; but the unjust knoweth noshame. 

{3:6} I have cut off the nations: their towers are desolate; Imade their streets waste, that none passeth by: their cities aredestroyed, so that there is no man, that there is none inhabitant.

{3:7} I said, Surely thou wilt fear me, thou wilt receive instruction;so their dwelling should not be cut off, howsoever I punished them: butthey rose early, [and] corrupted all their doings.   

{3:8} Therefore wait ye upon me, saith the LORD, until the day thatI rise up to the prey: for my determination [is] to gather the nations,that I may assemble the kingdoms, to pour upon them mine indignation,[even] all my fierce anger: for all the earth shall be devoured withthe fire of my jealousy. 

{3:9} For then will I turn to the people apure language, that they may all call upon the name of the LORD, toserve him with one consent. 

{3:10} From beyond the rivers of Ethiopiamy suppliants, [even] the daughter of my dispersed, shall bring mineoffering. 

{3:11} In that day shalt thou not be ashamed for all thydoings, wherein thou hast transgressed against me: for then I will takeaway out of the midst of thee them that rejoice in thy pride, and thoushalt no more be haughty because of my holy mountain. 

{3:12} I willalso leave in the midst of thee an afflicted and poor people, and theyshall trust in the name of the LORD. 

{3:13} The remnant of Israel shallnot do iniquity, nor speak lies; neither shall a deceitful tongue befound in their mouth: for they shall feed and lie down, and none shallmake [them] afraid.   

{3:14} Sing, O daughter of Zion; shout, O Israel; be glad andrejoice with all the heart, O daughter of Jerusalem. 

{3:15} The LORDhath taken away thy judgments, he hath cast out thine enemy: the kingof Israel, [even] the LORD, [is] in the midst of thee: thou shalt notsee evil any more. 

{3:16} In that day it shall be said to Jerusalem,Fear thou not: [and to] Zion, Let not thine hands be slack. 

{3:17} TheLORD thy God in the midst of thee [is] mighty; he will save, he willrejoice over thee with joy; he will rest in his love, he will joy overthee with singing. 

{3:18} I will gather [them that are] sorrowful forthe solemn assembly, [who] are of thee, [to whom] the reproach of it[was] a burden. 

{3:19} Behold, at that time I will undo all thatafflict thee: and I will save her that halteth, and gather her that wasdriven out; and I will get them praise and fame in every land wherethey have been put to shame. 

{3:20} At that time will I bring you[again,] even in the time that I gather you: for I will make you a nameand a praise among all people of the earth, when I turn back yourcaptivity before your eyes, saith the LORD.
