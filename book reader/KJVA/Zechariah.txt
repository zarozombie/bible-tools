{Zechariah   

{1:1} In the eighth month, in the second year of Darius, came theword of the LORD unto Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddothe prophet, saying, 

{1:2} The LORD hath been sore displeased with yourfathers. 

{1:3} Therefore say thou unto them, Thus saith the LORD ofhosts; Turn ye unto me, saith the LORD of hosts, and I will turn untoyou, saith the LORD of hosts. 

{1:4} Be ye not as your fathers, untowhom the former prophets have cried, saying, Thus saith the LORD ofhosts; Turn ye now from your evil ways, and [from] your evil doings:but they did not hear, nor hearken unto me, saith the LORD. 

{1:5} Yourfathers, where [are] they? and the prophets, do they live for ever?

{1:6} But my words and my statutes, which I commanded my servants theprophets, did they not take hold of your fathers? and they returned andsaid, Like as the LORD of hosts thought to do unto us, according to ourways, and according to our doings, so hath he dealt with us.   

{1:7} Upon the four and twentieth day of the eleventh month, which[is] the month Sebat, in the second year of Darius, came the word ofthe LORD unto Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo theprophet, saying, 

{1:8} I saw by night, and behold a man riding upon ared horse, and he stood among the myrtle trees that [were] in thebottom; and behind him [were there] red horses, speckled, and white.

{1:9} Then said I, O my lord, what [are] these? And the angel thattalked with me said unto me, I will shew thee what these [be. ]

{1:10}And the man that stood among the myrtle trees answered and said, These[are they] whom the LORD hath sent to walk to and fro through theearth. 

{1:11} And they answered the angel of the LORD that stood amongthe myrtle trees, and said, We have walked to and fro through theearth, and, behold, all the earth sitteth still, and is at rest.   

{1:12} Then the angel of the LORD answered and said, O LORD ofhosts, how long wilt thou not have mercy on Jerusalem and on the citiesof Judah, against which thou hast had indignation these threescore andten years? 

{1:13} And the LORD answered the angel that talked with me[with] good words [and] comfortable words. 

{1:14} So the angel thatcommuned with me said unto me, Cry thou, saying, Thus saith the LORD ofhosts; I am jealous for Jerusalem and for Zion with a great jealousy.

{1:15} And I am very sore displeased with the heathen [that are] atease: for I was but a little displeased, and they helped forward theaffliction. 

{1:16} Therefore thus saith the LORD; I am returned toJerusalem with mercies: my house shall be built in it, saith the LORDof hosts, and a line shall be stretched forth upon Jerusalem. 

{1:17}Cry yet, saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; My cities throughprosperity shall yet be spread abroad; and the LORD shall yet comfortZion, and shall yet choose Jerusalem.   

{1:18} Then lifted I up mine eyes, and saw, and behold four horns.

{1:19} And I said unto the angel that talked with me, What [be] these?And he answered me, These [are] the horns which have scattered Judah,Israel, and Jerusalem. 

{1:20} And the LORD shewed me four carpenters.

{1:21} Then said I, What come these to do? And he spake, saying, These[are] the horns which have scattered Judah, so that no man did lift uphis head: but these are come to fray them, to cast out the horns of theGentiles, which lifted up [their] horn over the land of Judah toscatter it.   

{2:1} I lifted up mine eyes again, and looked, and behold a man witha measuring line in his hand. 

{2:2} Then said I, Whither goest thou?And he said unto me, To measure Jerusalem, to see what [is] the breadththereof, and what [is] the length thereof. 

{2:3} And, behold, the angelthat talked with me went forth, and another angel went out to meet him,

{2:4} And said unto him, Run, speak to this young man, saying,Jerusalem shall be inhabited [as] towns without walls for the multitudeof men and cattle therein: 

{2:5} For I, saith the LORD, will be untoher a wall of fire round about, and will be the glory in the midst ofher.   

{2:6} Ho, ho, [come forth,] and flee from the land of the north,saith the LORD: for I have spread you abroad as the four winds of theheaven, saith the LORD. 

{2:7} Deliver thyself, O Zion, that dwellest[with] the daughter of Babylon. 

{2:8} For thus saith the LORD of hosts;After the glory hath he sent me unto the nations which spoiled you: forhe that toucheth you toucheth the apple of his eye. 

{2:9} For, behold,I will shake mine hand upon them, and they shall be a spoil to theirservants: and ye shall know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me.   

{2:10} Sing and rejoice, O daughter of Zion: for, lo, I come, and Iwill dwell in the midst of thee, saith the LORD. 

{2:11} And manynations shall be joined to the LORD in that day, and shall be mypeople: and I will dwell in the midst of thee, and thou shalt know thatthe LORD of hosts hath sent me unto thee. 

{2:12} And the LORD shallinherit Judah his portion in the holy land, and shall choose Jerusalemagain. 

{2:13} Be silent, O all flesh, before the LORD: for he is raisedup out of his holy habitation.   

{3:1} And he shewed me Joshua the high priest standing before theangel of the LORD, and Satan standing at his right hand to resist him.

{3:2} And the LORD said unto Satan, The LORD rebuke thee, O Satan; eventhe LORD that hath chosen Jerusalem rebuke thee: [is] not this a brandplucked out of the fire? 

{3:3} Now Joshua was clothed with filthygarments, and stood before the angel. 

{3:4} And he answered and spakeunto those that stood before him, saying, Take away the filthy garmentsfrom him. And unto him he said, Behold, I have caused thine iniquity topass from thee, and I will clothe thee with change of raiment. 

{3:5}And I said, Let them set a fair mitre upon his head. So they set a fairmitre upon his head, and clothed him with garments. And the angel ofthe LORD stood by. 

{3:6} And the angel of the LORD protested untoJoshua, saying, 

{3:7} Thus saith the LORD of hosts; If thou wilt walkin my ways, and if thou wilt keep my charge, then thou shalt also judgemy house, and shalt also keep my courts, and I will give thee places towalk among these that stand by. 

{3:8} Hear now, O Joshua the highpriest, thou, and thy fellows that sit before thee: for they [are] menwondered at: for, behold, I will bring forth my servant the BRANCH.

{3:9} For behold the stone that I have laid before Joshua; upon onestone [shall be] seven eyes: behold, I will engrave the gravingthereof, saith the LORD of hosts, and I will remove the iniquity ofthat land in one day. 

{3:10} In that day, saith the LORD of hosts,shall ye call every man his neighbour under the vine and under the figtree.   

{4:1} And the angel that talked with me came again, and waked me, asa man that is wakened out of his sleep, 

{4:2} And said unto me, Whatseest thou? And I said, I have looked, and behold a candlestick all[of] gold, with a bowl upon the top of it, and his seven lamps thereon,and seven pipes to the seven lamps, which [are] upon the top thereof:

{4:3} And two olive trees by it, one upon the right [side] of the bowl,and the other upon the left [side] thereof. 

{4:4} So I answered andspake to the angel that talked with me, saying, What [are] these, mylord? 

{4:5} Then the angel that talked with me answered and said untome, Knowest thou not what these be? And I said, No, my lord. 

{4:6} Thenhe answered and spake unto me, saying, This [is] the word of the LORDunto Zerubbabel, saying, Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit,saith the LORD of hosts. 

{4:7} Who [art] thou, O great mountain? beforeZerubbabel [thou shalt become] a plain: and he shall bring forth theheadstone [thereof with] shoutings, [crying,] Grace, grace unto it.

{4:8} Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 

{4:9} Thehands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house; his handsshall also finish it; and thou shalt know that the LORD of hosts hathsent me unto you. 

{4:10} For who hath despised the day of small things?for they shall rejoice, and shall see the plummet in the hand ofZerubbabel [with] those seven; they [are] the eyes of the LORD, whichrun to and fro through the whole earth.   

{4:11} Then answered I, and said unto him, What [are] these twoolive trees upon the right [side] of the candlestick and upon the left[side] thereof? 

{4:12} And I answered again, and said unto him, What[be these] two olive branches which through the two golden pipes emptythe golden [oil] out of themselves? 

{4:13} And he answered me and said,Knowest thou not what these [be?] And I said, No, my lord. 

{4:14} Thensaid he, These [are] the two anointed ones, that stand by the LORD ofthe whole earth.   

{5:1} Then I turned, and lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and beholda flying roll. 

{5:2} And he said unto me, What seest thou? And Ianswered, I see a flying roll; the length thereof [is] twenty cubits,and the breadth thereof ten cubits. 

{5:3} Then said he unto me, This[is] the curse that goeth forth over the face of the whole earth: forevery one that stealeth shall be cut off [as] on this side according toit; and every one that sweareth shall be cut off [as] on that sideaccording to it. 

{5:4} I will bring it forth, saith the LORD of hosts,and it shall enter into the house of the thief, and into the house ofhim that sweareth falsely by my name: and it shall remain in the midstof his house, and shall consume it with the timber thereof and thestones thereof.   

{5:5} Then the angel that talked with me went forth, and said untome, Lift up now thine eyes, and see what [is] this that goeth forth.

{5:6} And I said, What [is] it? And he said, This [is] an ephah thatgoeth forth. He said moreover, This [is] their resemblance through allthe earth. 

{5:7} And, behold, there was lifted up a talent of lead: andthis [is] a woman that sitteth in the midst of the ephah. 

{5:8} And hesaid, This [is] wickedness. And he cast it into the midst of the ephah;and he cast the weight of lead upon the mouth thereof. 

{5:9} Thenlifted I up mine eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came out twowomen, and the wind [was] in their wings; for they had wings like thewings of a stork: and they lifted up the ephah between the earth andthe heaven. 

{5:10} Then said I to the angel that talked with me,Whither do these bear the ephah? 

{5:11} And he said unto me, To buildit an house in the land of Shinar: and it shall be established, and setthere upon her own base.   

{6:1} And I turned, and lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and,behold, there came four chariots out from between two mountains; andthe mountains [were] mountains of brass. 

{6:2} In the first chariot[were] red horses; and in the second chariot black horses; 

{6:3} And inthe third chariot white horses; and in the fourth chariot grisled andbay horses. 

{6:4} Then I answered and said unto the angel that talkedwith me, What [are] these, my lord? 

{6:5} And the angel answered andsaid unto me, These [are] the four spirits of the heavens, which goforth from standing before the Lord of all the earth. 

{6:6} The blackhorses which [are] therein go forth into the north country; and thewhite go forth after them; and the grisled go forth toward the southcountry. 

{6:7} And the bay went forth, and sought to go that they mightwalk to and fro through the earth: and he said, Get you hence, walk toand fro through the earth. So they walked to and fro through the earth.

{6:8} Then cried he upon me, and spake unto me, saying, Behold, thesethat go toward the north country have quieted my spirit in the northcountry.   

{6:9} And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 

{6:10} Take of[them of] the captivity, [even] of Heldai, of Tobijah, and of Jedaiah,which are come from Babylon, and come thou the same day, and go intothe house of Josiah the son of Zephaniah; 

{6:11} Then take silver andgold, and make crowns, and set [them] upon the head of Joshua the sonof Josedech, the high priest; 

{6:12} And speak unto him, saying, Thusspeaketh the LORD of hosts, saying, Behold the man whose name [is] TheBRANCH; and he shall grow up out of his place, and he shall build thetemple of the LORD: 

{6:13} Even he shall build the temple of the LORD;and he shall bear the glory, and shall sit and rule upon his throne;and he shall be a priest upon his throne: and the counsel of peaceshall be between them both. 

{6:14} And the crowns shall be to Helem,and to Tobijah, and to Jedaiah, and to Hen the son of Zephaniah, for amemorial in the temple of the LORD. 

{6:15} And they [that are] far offshall come and build in the temple of the LORD, and ye shall know thatthe LORD of hosts hath sent me unto you. And [this] shall come to pass,if ye will diligently obey the voice of the LORD your God.   

{7:1} And it came to pass in the fourth year of king Darius, [that]the word of the LORD came unto Zechariah in the fourth [day] of theninth month, [even] in Chisleu; 

{7:2} When they had sent unto the houseof God Sherezer and Regem-melech, and their men, to pray before theLORD, 

{7:3} [And] to speak unto the priests which [were] in the houseof the LORD of hosts, and to the prophets, saying, Should I weep in thefifth month, separating myself, as I have done these so many years?   

{7:4} Then came the word of the LORD of hosts unto me, saying, 

{7:5}Speak unto all the people of the land, and to the priests, saying, Whenye fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh [month,] even thoseseventy years, did ye at all fast unto me, [even] to me? 

{7:6} And whenye did eat, and when ye did drink, did not ye eat [for yourselves,] anddrink [for yourselves? ]

{7:7} [Should ye] not [hear] the words whichthe LORD hath cried by the former prophets, when Jerusalem wasinhabited and in prosperity, and the cities thereof round about her,when [men] inhabited the south and the plain?   

{7:8} And the word of the LORD came unto Zechariah, saying, 

{7:9}Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, saying, Execute true judgment, andshew mercy and compassions every man to his brother: 

{7:10} And oppressnot the widow, nor the fatherless, the stranger, nor the poor; and letnone of you imagine evil against his brother in your heart. 

{7:11} Butthey refused to hearken, and pulled away the shoulder, and stoppedtheir ears, that they should not hear. 

{7:12} Yea, they made theirhearts [as] an adamant stone, lest they should hear the law, and thewords which the LORD of hosts hath sent in his spirit by the formerprophets: therefore came a great wrath from the LORD of hosts. 

{7:13}Therefore it is come to pass, [that] as he cried, and they would nothear; so they cried, and I would not hear, saith the LORD of hosts:

{7:14} But I scattered them with a whirlwind among all the nations whomthey knew not. Thus the land was desolate after them, that no manpassed through nor returned: for they laid the pleasant land desolate.   

{8:1} Again the word of the LORD of hosts came [to me,] saying,

{8:2} Thus saith the LORD of hosts; I was jealous for Zion with greatjealousy, and I was jealous for her with great fury. 

{8:3} Thus saiththe LORD; I am returned unto Zion, and will dwell in the midst ofJerusalem: and Jerusalem shall be called a city of truth; and themountain of the LORD of hosts the holy mountain. 

{8:4} Thus saith theLORD of hosts; There shall yet old men and old women dwell in thestreets of Jerusalem, and every man with his staff in his hand for veryage. 

{8:5} And the streets of the city shall be full of boys and girlsplaying in the streets thereof. 

{8:6} Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Ifit be marvellous in the eyes of the remnant of this people in thesedays, should it also be marvellous in mine eyes? saith the LORD ofhosts. 

{8:7} Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Behold, I will save mypeople from the east country, and from the west country; 

{8:8} And Iwill bring them, and they shall dwell in the midst of Jerusalem: andthey shall be my people, and I will be their God, in truth and inrighteousness.   

{8:9} Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Let your hands be strong, yethat hear in these days these words by the mouth of the prophets, which[were] in the day [that] the foundation of the house of the LORD ofhosts was laid, that the temple might be built. 

{8:10} For before thesedays there was no hire for man, nor any hire for beast; neither [wasthere any] peace to him that went out or came in because of theaffliction: for I set all men every one against his neighbour. 

{8:11}But now I [will] not [be] unto the residue of this people as in theformer days, saith the LORD of hosts. 

{8:12} For the seed [shall be]prosperous; the vine shall give her fruit, and the ground shall giveher increase, and the heavens shall give their dew; and I will causethe remnant of this people to possess all these [things. ]

{8:13} And itshall come to pass, [that] as ye were a curse among the heathen, Ohouse of Judah, and house of Israel; so will I save you, and ye shallbe a blessing: fear not, [but] let your hands be strong. 

{8:14} Forthus saith the LORD of hosts; As I thought to punish you, when yourfathers provoked me to wrath, saith the LORD of hosts, and I repentednot: 

{8:15} So again have I thought in these days to do well untoJerusalem and to the house of Judah: fear ye not.   

{8:16} These [are] the things that ye shall do; Speak ye every manthe truth to his neighbour; execute the judgment of truth and peace inyour gates: 

{8:17} And let none of you imagine evil in your heartsagainst his neighbour; and love no false oath: for all these [arethings] that I hate, saith the LORD.   

{8:18} And the word of the LORD of hosts came unto me, saying,

{8:19} Thus saith the LORD of hosts; The fast of the fourth [month,]and the fast of the fifth, and the fast of the seventh, and the fast ofthe tenth, shall be to the house of Judah joy and gladness, andcheerful feasts; therefore love the truth and peace. 

{8:20} Thus saiththe LORD of hosts; [It shall] yet [come to pass,] that there shall comepeople, and the inhabitants of many cities: 

{8:21} And the inhabitantsof one [city] shall go to another, saying, Let us go speedily to praybefore the LORD, and to seek the LORD of hosts: I will go also. 

{8:22}Yea, many people and strong nations shall come to seek the LORD ofhosts in Jerusalem, and to pray before the LORD. 

{8:23} Thus saith theLORD of hosts; In those days [it shall come to pass,] that ten menshall take hold out of all languages of the nations, even shall takehold of the skirt of him that is a Jew, saying, We will go with you:for we have heard [that] God [is] with you.   

{9:1} The burden of the word of the LORD in the land of Hadrach, andDamascus [shall be] the rest thereof: when the eyes of man, as of allthe tribes of Israel, [shall be] toward the LORD. 

{9:2} And Hamath alsoshall border thereby; Tyrus, and Zidon, though it be very wise. 

{9:3}And Tyrus did build herself a strong hold, and heaped up silver as thedust, and fine gold as the mire of the streets. 

{9:4} Behold, the Lordwill cast her out, and he will smite her power in the sea; and sheshall be devoured with fire. 

{9:5} Ashkelon shall see [it,] and fear;Gaza also [shall see it,] and be very sorrowful, and Ekron; for herexpectation shall be ashamed; and the king shall perish from Gaza, andAshkelon shall not be inhabited. 

{9:6} And a bastard shall dwell inAshdod, and I will cut off the pride of the Philistines. 

{9:7} And Iwill take away his blood out of his mouth, and his abominations frombetween his teeth: but he that remaineth, even he, [shall be] for ourGod, and he shall be as a governor in Judah, and Ekron as a Jebusite.

{9:8} And I will encamp about mine house because of the army, becauseof him that passeth by, and because of him that returneth: and nooppressor shall pass through them any more: for now have I seen withmine eyes.   

{9:9} Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion; shout, O daughter ofJerusalem: behold, thy King cometh unto thee: he [is] just, and havingsalvation; lowly, and riding upon an ass, and upon a colt the foal ofan ass. 

{9:10} And I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim, and thehorse from Jerusalem, and the battle bow shall be cut off: and he shallspeak peace unto the heathen: and his dominion [shall be] from sea[even] to sea, and from river [even] to the ends of the earth. 

{9:11}As for thee also, by the blood of thy covenant I have sent forth thyprisoners out of the pit wherein [is] no water.   

{9:12} Turn you to the strong hold, ye prisoners of hope: even today do I declare [that] I will render double unto thee; 

{9:13} When Ihave bent Judah for me, filled the bow with Ephraim, and raised up thysons, O Zion, against thy sons, O Greece, and made thee as the sword ofa mighty man. 

{9:14} And the LORD shall be seen over them, and hisarrow shall go forth as the lightning: and the LORD GOD shall blow thetrumpet, and shall go with whirlwinds of the south. 

{9:15} The LORD ofhosts shall defend them; and they shall devour, and subdue with slingstones; and they shall drink, [and] make a noise as through wine; andthey shall be filled like bowls, [and] as the corners of the altar.

{9:16} And the LORD their God shall save them in that day as the flockof his people: for they [shall be as] the stones of a crown, lifted upas an ensign upon his land. 

{9:17} For how great [is] his goodness, andhow great [is] his beauty! corn shall make the young men cheerful, andnew wine the maids.   

{10:1} Ask ye of the LORD rain in the time of the latter rain; [so]the LORD shall make bright clouds, and give them showers of rain, toevery one grass in the field. 

{10:2} For the idols have spoken vanity,and the diviners have seen a lie, and have told false dreams; theycomfort in vain: therefore they went their way as a flock, they weretroubled, because [there was] no shepherd. 

{10:3} Mine anger waskindled against the shepherds, and I punished the goats: for the LORDof hosts hath visited his flock the house of Judah, and hath made themas his goodly horse in the battle. 

{10:4} Out of him came forth thecorner, out of him the nail, out of him the battle bow, out of himevery oppressor together.   

{10:5} And they shall be as mighty [men,] which tread down [theirenemies] in the mire of the streets in the battle: and they shallfight, because the LORD [is] with them, and the riders on horses shallbe confounded. 

{10:6} And I will strengthen the house of Judah, and Iwill save the house of Joseph, and I will bring them again to placethem; for I have mercy upon them: and they shall be as though I had notcast them off: for I [am] the LORD their God, and will hear them.

{10:7} And [they of] Ephraim shall be like a mighty [man,] and theirheart shall rejoice as through wine: yea, their children shall see[it,] and be glad; their heart shall rejoice in the LORD. 

{10:8} I willhiss for them, and gather them; for I have redeemed them: and theyshall increase as they have increased. 

{10:9} And I will sow them amongthe people: and they shall remember me in far countries; and they shalllive with their children, and turn again. 

{10:10} I will bring themagain also out of the land of Egypt, and gather them out of Assyria;and I will bring them into the land of Gilead and Lebanon; and [place]shall not be found for them. 

{10:11} And he shall pass through the seawith affliction, and shall smite the waves in the sea, and all thedeeps of the river shall dry up: and the pride of Assyria shall bebrought down, and the sceptre of Egypt shall depart away. 

{10:12} And Iwill strengthen them in the LORD; and they shall walk up and down inhis name, saith the LORD.   

{11:1} Open thy doors, O Lebanon, that the fire may devour thycedars. 

{11:2} Howl, fir tree; for the cedar is fallen; because themighty are spoiled: howl, O ye oaks of Bashan; for the forest of thevintage is come down.   

{11:3} [There is] a voice of the howling of the shepherds; for theirglory is spoiled: a voice of the roaring of young lions; for the prideof Jordan is spoiled. 

{11:4} Thus saith the LORD my God; Feed the flockof the slaughter; 

{11:5} Whose possessors slay them, and holdthemselves not guilty: and they that sell them say, Blessed [be] theLORD; for I am rich: and their own shepherds pity them not. 

{11:6} ForI will no more pity the inhabitants of the land, saith the LORD: but,lo, I will deliver the men every one into his neighbour's hand, andinto the hand of his king: and they shall smite the land, and out oftheir hand I will not deliver [them. ]

{11:7} And I will feed the flockof slaughter, [even] you, O poor of the flock. And I took unto me twostaves; the one I called Beauty, and the other I called Bands; and Ifed the flock. 

{11:8} Three shepherds also I cut off in one month; andmy soul lothed them, and their soul also abhorred me. 

{11:9} Then saidI, I will not feed you: that that dieth, let it die; and that that isto be cut off, let it be cut off; and let the rest eat every one theflesh of another.   

{11:10} And I took my staff, [even] Beauty, and cut it asunder, thatI might break my covenant which I had made with all the people. 

{11:11}And it was broken in that day: and so the poor of the flock that waitedupon me knew that it [was] the word of the LORD. 

{11:12} And I saidunto them, If ye think good, give [me] my price; and if not, forbear.So they weighed for my price thirty [pieces] of silver. 

{11:13} And theLORD said unto me, Cast it unto the potter: a goodly price that I wasprised at of them. And I took the thirty [pieces] of silver, and castthem to the potter in the house of the LORD. 

{11:14} Then I cut asundermine other staff, [even] Bands, that I might break the brotherhoodbetween Judah and Israel.   

{11:15} And the LORD said unto me, Take unto thee yet theinstruments of a foolish shepherd. 

{11:16} For, lo, I will raise up ashepherd in the land, [which] shall not visit those that be cut off,neither shall seek the young one, nor heal that that is broken, norfeed that that standeth still: but he shall eat the flesh of the fat,and tear their claws in pieces. 

{11:17} Woe to the idol shepherd thatleaveth the flock! the sword [shall be] upon his arm, and upon hisright eye: his arm shall be clean dried up, and his right eye shall beutterly darkened.   

{12:1} The burden of the word of the LORD for Israel, saith theLORD, which stretcheth forth the heavens, and layeth the foundation ofthe earth, and formeth the spirit of man within him. 

{12:2} Behold, Iwill make Jerusalem a cup of trembling unto all the people round about,when they shall be in the siege both against Judah [and] againstJerusalem.   

{12:3} And in that day will I make Jerusalem a burdensome stone forall people: all that burden themselves with it shall be cut in pieces,though all the people of the earth be gathered together against it.

{12:4} In that day, saith the LORD, I will smite every horse withastonishment, and his rider with madness: and I will open mine eyesupon the house of Judah, and will smite every horse of the people withblindness. 

{12:5} And the governors of Judah shall say in their heart,The inhabitants of Jerusalem [shall be] my strength in the LORD ofhosts their God.   

{12:6} In that day will I make the governors of Judah like an hearthof fire among the wood, and like a torch of fire in a sheaf; and theyshall devour all the people round about, on the right hand and on theleft: and Jerusalem shall be inhabited again in her own place, [even]in Jerusalem. 

{12:7} The LORD also shall save the tents of Judah first,that the glory of the house of David and the glory of the inhabitantsof Jerusalem do not magnify [themselves] against Judah. 

{12:8} In thatday shall the LORD defend the inhabitants of Jerusalem; and he that isfeeble among them at that day shall be as David; and the house of David[shall be] as God, as the angel of the LORD before them.   

{12:9} And it shall come to pass in that day, [that] I will seek todestroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem. 

{12:10} And I willpour upon the house of David, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem,the spirit of grace and of supplications: and they shall look upon mewhom they have pierced, and they shall mourn for him, as one mournethfor [his] only [son,] and shall be in bitterness for him, as one thatis in bitterness for [his] firstborn. 

{12:11} In that day shall therebe a great mourning in Jerusalem, as the mourning of Hadadrimmon in thevalley of Megiddon. 

{12:12} And the land shall mourn, every familyapart; the family of the house of David apart, and their wives apart;the family of the house of Nathan apart, and their wives apart; 

{12:13}The family of the house of Levi apart, and their wives apart; thefamily of Shimei apart, and their wives apart; 

{12:14} All the familiesthat remain, every family apart, and their wives apart.   

{13:1} In that day there shall be a fountain opened to the house ofDavid and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem for sin and for uncleanness.   

{13:2} And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the LORD ofhosts, [that] I will cut off the names of the idols out of the land,and they shall no more be remembered: and also I will cause theprophets and the unclean spirit to pass out of the land. 

{13:3} And itshall come to pass, [that] when any shall yet prophesy, then his fatherand his mother that begat him shall say unto him, Thou shalt not live;for thou speakest lies in the name of the LORD: and his father and hismother that begat him shall thrust him through when he prophesieth.

{13:4} And it shall come to pass in that day, [that] the prophets shallbe ashamed every one of his vision, when he hath prophesied; neithershall they wear a rough garment to deceive: 

{13:5} But he shall say, I[am] no prophet, I [am] an husbandman; for man taught me to keep cattlefrom my youth. 

{13:6} And [one] shall say unto him, What [are] thesewounds in thine hands? Then he shall answer, [Those] with which I waswounded [in] the house of my friends.   

{13:7} Awake, O sword, against my shepherd, and against the man[that is] my fellow, saith the LORD of hosts: smite the shepherd, andthe sheep shall be scattered: and I will turn mine hand upon the littleones. 

{13:8} And it shall come to pass, [that] in all the land, saiththe LORD, two parts therein shall be cut off [and] die; but the thirdshall be left therein. 

{13:9} And I will bring the third part throughthe fire, and will refine them as silver is refined, and will try themas gold is tried: they shall call on my name, and I will hear them: Iwill say, It [is] my people: and they shall say, The LORD [is] my God.   

{14:1} Behold, the day of the LORD cometh, and thy spoil shall bedivided in the midst of thee. 

{14:2} For I will gather all nationsagainst Jerusalem to battle; and the city shall be taken, and thehouses rifled, and the women ravished; and half of the city shall goforth into captivity, and the residue of the people shall not be cutoff from the city. 

{14:3} Then shall the LORD go forth, and fightagainst those nations, as when he fought in the day of battle.   

{14:4} And his feet shall stand in that day upon the mount ofOlives, which [is] before Jerusalem on the east, and the mount ofOlives shall cleave in the midst thereof toward the east and toward thewest, [and there shall be] a very great valley; and half of themountain shall remove toward the north, and half of it toward thesouth. 

{14:5} And ye shall flee [to] the valley of the mountains; forthe valley of the mountains shall reach unto Azal: yea, ye shall flee,like as ye fled from before the earthquake in the days of Uzziah kingof Judah: and the LORD my God shall come, [and] all the saints withthee. 

{14:6} And it shall come to pass in that day, [that] the lightshall not be clear, [nor] dark: 

{14:7} But it shall be one day whichshall be known to the LORD, not day, nor night: but it shall come topass, [that] at evening time it shall be light. 

{14:8} And it shall bein that day, [that] living waters shall go out from Jerusalem; half ofthem toward the former sea, and half of them toward the hinder sea: insummer and in winter shall it be. 

{14:9} And the LORD shall be kingover all the earth: in that day shall there be one LORD, and his nameone. 

{14:10} All the land shall be turned as a plain from Geba toRimmon south of Jerusalem: and it shall be lifted up, and inhabited inher place, from Benjamin's gate unto the place of the first gate, untothe corner gate, and [from] the tower of Hananeel unto the king'swinepresses. 

{14:11} And [men] shall dwell in it, and there shall be nomore utter destruction; but Jerusalem shall be safely inhabited.   

{14:12} And this shall be the plague wherewith the LORD will smiteall the people that have fought against Jerusalem; Their flesh shallconsume away while they stand upon their feet, and their eyes shallconsume away in their holes, and their tongue shall consume away intheir mouth. 

{14:13} And it shall come to pass in that day, [that] agreat tumult from the LORD shall be among them; and they shall lay holdevery one on the hand of his neighbour, and his hand shall rise upagainst the hand of his neighbour. 

{14:14} And Judah also shall fightat Jerusalem; and the wealth of all the heathen round about shall begathered together, gold, and silver, and apparel, in great abundance.

{14:15} And so shall be the plague of the horse, of the mule, of thecamel, and of the ass, and of all the beasts that shall be in thesetents, as this plague.   

{14:16} And it shall come to pass, [that] every one that is left ofall the nations which came against Jerusalem shall even go up from yearto year to worship the King, the LORD of hosts, and to keep the feastof tabernacles. 

{14:17} And it shall be, [that] whoso will not come upof [all] the families of the earth unto Jerusalem to worship the King,the LORD of hosts, even upon them shall be no rain. 

{14:18} And if thefamily of Egypt go not up, and come not, that [have] no [rain;] thereshall be the plague, wherewith the LORD will smite the heathen thatcome not up to keep the feast of tabernacles. 

{14:19} This shall be thepunishment of Egypt, and the punishment of all nations that come not upto keep the feast of tabernacles.   

{14:20} In that day shall there be upon the bells of the horses,HOLINESS UNTO THE LORD; and the pots in the LORD'S house shall be likethe bowls before the altar. 

{14:21} Yea, every pot in Jerusalem and inJudah shall be holiness unto the LORD of hosts: and all they thatsacrifice shall come and take of them, and seethe therein: and in thatday there shall be no more the Canaanite in the house of the LORD ofhosts.
