{The Second Epistle of John   

{1:1} The elder unto the elect lady and her children, whom I love inthe truth; and not I only, but also all they that have known the truth;

{1:2} For the truth's sake, which dwelleth in us, and shall be with usfor ever. 

{1:3} Grace be with you, mercy, [and] peace, from God theFather, and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truthand love.   

{1:4} I rejoiced greatly that I found of thy children walking intruth, as we have received a commandment from the Father. 

{1:5} And nowI beseech thee, lady, not as though I wrote a new commandment untothee, but that which we had from the beginning, that we love oneanother. 

{1:6} And this is love, that we walk after his commandments.This is the commandment, That, as ye have heard from the beginning, yeshould walk in it. 

{1:7} For many deceivers are entered into the world,who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh. This is adeceiver and an antichrist. 

{1:8} Look to yourselves, that we lose notthose things which we have wrought, but that we receive a full reward.

{1:9} Whosoever transgresseth, and abideth not in the doctrine ofChrist, hath not God. He that abideth in the doctrine of Christ, hehath both the Father and the Son. 

{1:10} If there come any unto you,and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into [your] house, neitherbid him God speed: 

{1:11} For he that biddeth him God speed is partakerof his evil deeds.   

{1:12} Having many things to write unto you, I would not [write]with paper and ink: but I trust to come unto you, and speak face toface, that our joy may be full. 

{1:13} The children of thy elect sistergreet thee. Amen.
