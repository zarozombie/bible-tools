{The First Book of the KingsCommonly Called the Third Book of the Kings   

{1:1} Now king David was old [and] stricken in years; and theycovered him with clothes, but he gat no heat. 

{1:2} Wherefore hisservants said unto him, Let there be sought for my lord the king ayoung virgin: and let her stand before the king, and let her cherishhim, and let her lie in thy bosom, that my lord the king may get heat.

{1:3} So they sought for a fair damsel throughout all the coasts ofIsrael, and found Abishag a Shunammite, and brought her to the king.

{1:4} And the damsel [was] very fair, and cherished the king, andministered to him: but the king knew her not.   

{1:5} Then Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself, saying, Iwill be king: and he prepared him chariots and horsemen, and fifty mento run before him. 

{1:6} And his father had not displeased him at anytime in saying, Why hast thou done so? and he also [was a] very goodly[man;] and [his mother] bare him after Absalom. 

{1:7} And he conferredwith Joab the son of Zeruiah, and with Abiathar the priest: and theyfollowing Adonijah helped [him. ]

{1:8} But Zadok the priest, andBenaiah the son of Jehoiada, and Nathan the prophet, and Shimei, andRei, and the mighty men which [belonged] to David, were not withAdonijah. 

{1:9} And Adonijah slew sheep and oxen and fat cattle by thestone of Zoheleth, which [is] by En-rogel, and called all his brethrenthe king's sons, and all the men of Judah the king's servants: 

{1:10}But Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah, and the mighty men, and Solomonhis brother, he called not.   

{1:11} Wherefore Nathan spake unto Bath-sheba the mother of Solomon,saying, Hast thou not heard that Adonijah the son of Haggith dothreign, and David our lord knoweth [it] not? 

{1:12} Now therefore come,let me, I pray thee, give thee counsel, that thou mayest save thine ownlife, and the life of thy son Solomon. 

{1:13} Go and get thee in untoking David, and say unto him, Didst not thou, my lord, O king, swearunto thine handmaid, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reignafter me, and he shall sit upon my throne? why then doth Adonijahreign? 

{1:14} Behold, while thou yet talkest there with the king, Ialso will come in after thee, and confirm thy words.   

{1:15} And Bath-sheba went in unto the king into the chamber: andthe king was very old; and Abishag the Shunammite ministered unto theking. 

{1:16} And Bath-sheba bowed, and did obeisance unto the king. Andthe king said, What wouldest thou? 

{1:17} And she said unto him, Mylord, thou swarest by the LORD thy God unto thine handmaid, [saying,]Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit uponmy throne. 

{1:18} And now, behold, Adonijah reigneth; and now, my lordthe king, thou knowest [it] not: 

{1:19} And he hath slain oxen and fatcattle and sheep in abundance, and hath called all the sons of theking, and Abiathar the priest, and Joab the captain of the host: butSolomon thy servant hath he not called. 

{1:20} And thou, my lord, Oking, the eyes of all Israel [are] upon thee, that thou shouldest tellthem who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after him. 

{1:21}Otherwise it shall come to pass, when my lord the king shall sleep withhis fathers, that I and my son Solomon shall be counted offenders.   

{1:22} And, lo, while she yet talked with the king, Nathan theprophet also came in. 

{1:23} And they told the king, saying, BeholdNathan the prophet. And when he was come in before the king, he bowedhimself before the king with his face to the ground. 

{1:24} And Nathansaid, My lord, O king, hast thou said, Adonijah shall reign after me,and he shall sit upon my throne? 

{1:25} For he is gone down this day,and hath slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in abundance, and hathcalled all the king's sons, and the captains of the host, and Abiatharthe priest; and, behold, they eat and drink before him, and say, Godsave king Adonijah. 

{1:26} But me, [even] me thy servant, and Zadok thepriest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and thy servant Solomon, hathhe not called. 

{1:27} Is this thing done by my lord the king, and thouhast not shewed [it] unto thy servant, who should sit on the throne ofmy lord the king after him?   

{1:28} Then king David answered and said, Call me Bath-sheba. Andshe came into the king's presence, and stood before the king. 

{1:29}And the king sware, and said, [As] the LORD liveth, that hath redeemedmy soul out of all distress, 

{1:30} Even as I sware unto thee by theLORD God of Israel, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign afterme, and he shall sit upon my throne in my stead; even so will Icertainly do this day. 

{1:31} Then Bath-sheba bowed with [her] face tothe earth, and did reverence to the king, and said, Let my lord kingDavid live for ever.   

{1:32} And king David said, Call me Zadok the priest, and Nathan theprophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada. And they came before theking. 

{1:33} The king also said unto them, Take with you the servantsof your lord, and cause Solomon my son to ride upon mine own mule, andbring him down to Gihon: 

{1:34} And let Zadok the priest and Nathan theprophet anoint him there king over Israel: and blow ye with thetrumpet, and say, God save king Solomon. 

{1:35} Then ye shall come upafter him, that he may come and sit upon my throne; for he shall beking in my stead: and I have appointed him to be ruler over Israel andover Judah. 

{1:36} And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king,and said, Amen: the LORD God of my lord the king say so [too. ]

{1:37}As the LORD hath been with my lord the king, even so be he withSolomon, and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord kingDavid. 

{1:38} So Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiahthe son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, wentdown, and caused Solomon to ride upon king David's mule, and broughthim to Gihon. 

{1:39} And Zadok the priest took an horn of oil out ofthe tabernacle, and anointed Solomon. And they blew the trumpet; andall the people said, God save king Solomon. 

{1:40} And all the peoplecame up after him, and the people piped with pipes, and rejoiced withgreat joy, so that the earth rent with the sound of them.   

{1:41} And Adonijah and all the guests that [were] with him heard[it] as they had made an end of eating. And when Joab heard the soundof the trumpet, he said, Wherefore [is this] noise of the city being inan uproar? 

{1:42} And while he yet spake, behold, Jonathan the son ofAbiathar the priest came: and Adonijah said unto him, Come in; for thou[art] a valiant man, and bringest good tidings. 

{1:43} And Jonathananswered and said to Adonijah, Verily our lord king David hath madeSolomon king. 

{1:44} And the king hath sent with him Zadok the priest,and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and theCherethites, and the Pelethites, and they have caused him to ride uponthe king's mule: 

{1:45} And Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophethave anointed him king in Gihon: and they are come up from thencerejoicing, so that the city rang again. This [is] the noise that yehave heard. 

{1:46} And also Solomon sitteth on the throne of thekingdom. 

{1:47} And moreover the king's servants came to bless our lordking David, saying, God make the name of Solomon better than thy name,and make his throne greater than thy throne. And the king bowed himselfupon the bed. 

{1:48} And also thus said the king, Blessed [be] the LORDGod of Israel, which hath given [one] to sit on my throne this day,mine eyes even seeing [it. ]

{1:49} And all the guests that [were] withAdonijah were afraid, and rose up, and went every man his way.   

{1:50} And Adonijah feared because of Solomon, and arose, and went,and caught hold on the horns of the altar. 

{1:51} And it was toldSolomon, saying, Behold, Adonijah feareth king Solomon: for, lo, hehath caught hold on the horns of the altar, saying, Let king Solomonswear unto me to day that he will not slay his servant with the sword.

{1:52} And Solomon said, If he will shew himself a worthy man, thereshall not an hair of him fall to the earth: but if wickedness shall befound in him, he shall die. 

{1:53} So king Solomon sent, and theybrought him down from the altar. And he came and bowed himself to kingSolomon: and Solomon said unto him, Go to thine house.   

{2:1} Now the days of David drew nigh that he should die; and hecharged Solomon his son, saying, 

{2:2} I go the way of all the earth:be thou strong therefore, and shew thyself a man; 

{2:3} And keep thecharge of the LORD thy God, to walk in his ways, to keep his statutes,and his commandments, and his judgments, and his testimonies, as it iswritten in the law of Moses, that thou mayest prosper in all that thoudoest, and whithersoever thou turnest thyself: 

{2:4} That the LORD maycontinue his word which he spake concerning me, saying, If thy childrentake heed to their way, to walk before me in truth with all their heartand with all their soul, there shall not fail thee (said he) a man onthe throne of Israel. 

{2:5} Moreover thou knowest also what Joab theson of Zeruiah did to me, [and] what he did to the two captains of thehosts of Israel, unto Abner the son of Ner, and unto Amasa the son ofJether, whom he slew, and shed the blood of war in peace, and put theblood of war upon his girdle that [was] about his loins, and in hisshoes that [were] on his feet. 

{2:6} Do therefore according to thywisdom, and let not his hoar head go down to the grave in peace. 

{2:7}But shew kindness unto the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite, and letthem be of those that eat at thy table: for so they came to me when Ifled because of Absalom thy brother. 

{2:8} And, behold, [thou hast]with thee Shimei the son of Gera, a Benjamite of Bahurim, which cursedme with a grievous curse in the day when I went to Mahanaim: but hecame down to meet me at Jordan, and I sware to him by the LORD, saying,I will not put thee to death with the sword. 

{2:9} Now therefore holdhim not guiltless: for thou [art] a wise man, and knowest what thououghtest to do unto him; but his hoar head bring thou down to the gravewith blood. 

{2:10} So David slept with his fathers, and was buried inthe city of David. 

{2:11} And the days that David reigned over Israel[were] forty years: seven years reigned he in Hebron, and thirty andthree years reigned he in Jerusalem.   

{2:12} Then sat Solomon upon the throne of David his father; and hiskingdom was established greatly.   

{2:13} And Adonijah the son of Haggith came to Bath-sheba the motherof Solomon. And she said, Comest thou peaceably? And he said,Peaceably. 

{2:14} He said moreover, I have somewhat to say unto thee.And she said, Say on. 

{2:15} And he said, Thou knowest that the kingdomwas mine, and [that] all Israel set their faces on me, that I shouldreign: howbeit the kingdom is turned about, and is become my brother's:for it was his from the LORD. 

{2:16} And now I ask one petition ofthee, deny me not. And she said unto him, Say on. 

{2:17} And he said,Speak, I pray thee, unto Solomon the king, (for he will not say theenay,) that he give me Abishag the Shunammite to wife. 

{2:18} AndBath-sheba said, Well; I will speak for thee unto the king.   

{2:19} Bath-sheba therefore went unto king Solomon, to speak untohim for Adonijah. And the king rose up to meet her, and bowed himselfunto her, and sat down on his throne, and caused a seat to be set forthe king's mother; and she sat on his right hand. 

{2:20} Then she said,I desire one small petition of thee; [I pray thee,] say me not nay. Andthe king said unto her, Ask on, my mother: for I will not say thee nay.

{2:21} And she said, Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijahthy brother to wife. 

{2:22} And king Solomon answered and said unto hismother, And why dost thou ask Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? askfor him the kingdom also; for he [is] mine elder brother; even for him,and for Abiathar the priest, and for Joab the son of Zeruiah. 

{2:23}Then king Solomon sware by the LORD, saying, God do so to me, and morealso, if Adonijah have not spoken this word against his own life.

{2:24} Now therefore, [as] the LORD liveth, which hath established me,and set me on the throne of David my father, and who hath made me anhouse, as he promised, Adonijah shall be put to death this day. 

{2:25}And king Solomon sent by the hand of Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; andhe fell upon him that he died.   

{2:26} And unto Abiathar the priest said the king, Get thee toAnathoth, unto thine own fields; for thou [art] worthy of death: but Iwill not at this time put thee to death, because thou barest the ark ofthe Lord GOD before David my father, and because thou hast beenafflicted in all wherein my father was afflicted. 

{2:27} So Solomonthrust out Abiathar from being priest unto the LORD; that he mightfulfil the word of the LORD, which he spake concerning the house of Eliin Shiloh.   

{2:28} Then tidings came to Joab: for Joab had turned afterAdonijah, though he turned not after Absalom. And Joab fled unto thetabernacle of the LORD, and caught hold on the horns of the altar.

{2:29} And it was told king Solomon that Joab was fled unto thetabernacle of the LORD; and, behold, [he is] by the altar. Then Solomonsent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, saying, Go, fall upon him. 

{2:30} AndBenaiah came to the tabernacle of the LORD, and said unto him, Thussaith the king, Come forth. And he said, Nay; but I will die here. AndBenaiah brought the king word again, saying, Thus said Joab, and thushe answered me. 

{2:31} And the king said unto him, Do as he hath said,and fall upon him, and bury him; that thou mayest take away theinnocent blood, which Joab shed, from me, and from the house of myfather. 

{2:32} And the LORD shall return his blood upon his own head,who fell upon two men more righteous and better than he, and slew themwith the sword, my father David not knowing [thereof, to wit,] Abnerthe son of Ner, captain of the host of Israel, and Amasa the son ofJether, captain of the host of Judah. 

{2:33} Their blood shalltherefore return upon the head of Joab, and upon the head of his seedfor ever: but upon David, and upon his seed, and upon his house, andupon his throne, shall there be peace for ever from the LORD. 

{2:34} SoBenaiah the son of Jehoiada went up, and fell upon him, and slew him:and he was buried in his own house in the wilderness.   

{2:35} And the king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his room overthe host: and Zadok the priest did the king put in the room of Abiathar.   

{2:36} And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him,Build thee an house in Jerusalem, and dwell there, and go not forththence any whither. 

{2:37} For it shall be, [that] on the day thougoest out, and passest over the brook Kidron, thou shalt know forcertain that thou shalt surely die: thy blood shall be upon thine ownhead. 

{2:38} And Shimei said unto the king, The saying [is] good: as mylord the king hath said, so will thy servant do. And Shimei dwelt inJerusalem many days. 

{2:39} And it came to pass at the end of threeyears, that two of the servants of Shimei ran away unto Achish son ofMaachah king of Gath. And they told Shimei, saying, Behold, thyservants [be] in Gath. 

{2:40} And Shimei arose, and saddled his ass,and went to Gath to Achish to seek his servants: and Shimei went, andbrought his servants from Gath. 

{2:41} And it was told Solomon thatShimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath, and was come again. 

{2:42} Andthe king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him, Did I not makethee to swear by the LORD, and protested unto thee, saying, Know for acertain, on the day thou goest out, and walkest abroad any whither,that thou shalt surely die? and thou saidst unto me, The word [that] Ihave heard [is] good. 

{2:43} Why then hast thou not kept the oath ofthe LORD, and the commandment that I have charged thee with? 

{2:44} Theking said moreover to Shimei, Thou knowest all the wickedness whichthine heart is privy to, that thou didst to David my father: thereforethe LORD shall return thy wickedness upon thine own head; 

{2:45} Andking Solomon [shall be] blessed, and the throne of David shall beestablished before the LORD for ever. 

{2:46} So the king commandedBenaiah the son of Jehoiada; which went out, and fell upon him, that hedied. And the kingdom was established in the hand of Solomon.   

{3:1} And Solomon made affinity with Pharaoh king of Egypt, and tookPharaoh's daughter, and brought her into the city of David, until hehad made an end of building his own house, and the house of the LORD,and the wall of Jerusalem round about. 

{3:2} Only the people sacrificedin high places, because there was no house built unto the name of theLORD, until those days. 

{3:3} And Solomon loved the LORD, walking inthe statutes of David his father: only he sacrificed and burnt incensein high places. 

{3:4} And the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there;for that [was] the great high place: a thousand burnt offerings didSolomon offer upon that altar.   

{3:5} In Gibeon the LORD appeared to Solomon in a dream by night:and God said, Ask what I shall give thee. 

{3:6} And Solomon said, Thouhast shewed unto thy servant David my father great mercy, according ashe walked before thee in truth, and in righteousness, and inuprightness of heart with thee; and thou hast kept for him this greatkindness, that thou hast given him a son to sit on his throne, as [itis] this day. 

{3:7} And now, O LORD my God, thou hast made thy servantking instead of David my father: and I [am but] a little child: I knownot [how] to go out or come in. 

{3:8} And thy servant [is] in the midstof thy people which thou hast chosen, a great people, that cannot benumbered nor counted for multitude. 

{3:9} Give therefore thy servant anunderstanding heart to judge thy people, that I may discern betweengood and bad: for who is able to judge this thy so great a people?

{3:10} And the speech pleased the Lord, that Solomon had asked thisthing. 

{3:11} And God said unto him, Because thou hast asked thisthing, and hast not asked for thyself long life; neither hast askedriches for thyself, nor hast asked the life of thine enemies; but hastasked for thyself understanding to discern judgment; 

{3:12} Behold, Ihave done according to thy words: lo, I have given thee a wise and anunderstanding heart; so that there was none like thee before thee,neither after thee shall any arise like unto thee. 

{3:13} And I havealso given thee that which thou hast not asked, both riches, andhonour: so that there shall not be any among the kings like unto theeall thy days. 

{3:14} And if thou wilt walk in my ways, to keep mystatutes and my commandments, as thy father David did walk, then I willlengthen thy days. 

{3:15} And Solomon awoke; and, behold, [it was] adream. And he came to Jerusalem, and stood before the ark of thecovenant of the LORD, and offered up burnt offerings, and offered peaceofferings, and made a feast to all his servants.   

{3:16} Then came there two women, [that were] harlots, unto theking, and stood before him. 

{3:17} And the one woman said, O my lord, Iand this woman dwell in one house; and I was delivered of a child withher in the house. 

{3:18} And it came to pass the third day after that Iwas delivered, that this woman was delivered also: and we [were]together; [there was] no stranger with us in the house, save we two inthe house. 

{3:19} And this woman's child died in the night; because sheoverlaid it. 

{3:20} And she arose at midnight, and took my son frombeside me, while thine handmaid slept, and laid it in her bosom, andlaid her dead child in my bosom. 

{3:21} And when I rose in the morningto give my child suck, behold, it was dead: but when I had consideredit in the morning, behold, it was not my son, which I did bear. 

{3:22}And the other woman said, Nay; but the living [is] my son, and the dead[is] thy son. And this said, No; but the dead [is] thy son, and theliving [is] my son. Thus they spake before the king. 

{3:23} Then saidthe king, The one saith, This [is] my son that liveth, and thy son [is]the dead: and the other saith, Nay; but thy son [is] the dead, and myson [is] the living. 

{3:24} And the king said, Bring me a sword. Andthey brought a sword before the king. 

{3:25} And the king said, Dividethe living child in two, and give half to the one, and half to theother. 

{3:26} Then spake the woman whose the living child [was] untothe king, for her bowels yearned upon her son, and she said, O my lord,give her the living child, and in no wise slay it. But the other said,Let it be neither mine nor thine, [but] divide [it. ]

{3:27} Then theking answered and said, Give her the living child, and in no wise slayit: she [is] the mother thereof. 

{3:28} And all Israel heard of thejudgment which the king had judged; and they feared the king: for theysaw that the wisdom of God [was] in him, to do judgment.   

{4:1} So king Solomon was king over all Israel. 

{4:2} And these[were] the princes which he had; Azariah the son of Zadok the priest,

{4:3} Elihoreph and Ahiah, the sons of Shisha, scribes; Jehoshaphat theson of Ahilud, the recorder. 

{4:4} And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada[was] over the host: and Zadok and Abiathar [were] the priests: 

{4:5}And Azariah the son of Nathan [was] over the officers: and Zabud theson of Nathan [was] principal officer, [and] the king's friend: 

{4:6}And Ahishar [was] over the household: and Adoniram the son of Abda[was] over the tribute. 

{4:7} And Solomon had twelve officers over allIsrael, which provided victuals for the king and his household: eachman his month in a year made provision. 

{4:8} And these [are] theirnames: The son of Hur, in mount Ephraim: 

{4:9} The son of Dekar, inMakaz, and in Shaalbim, and Beth-shemesh, and Elon-beth-hanan: 

{4:10}The son of Hesed, in Aruboth; to him [pertained] Sochoh, and all theland of Hepher: 

{4:11} The son of Abinadab, in all the region of Dor;which had Taphath the daughter of Solomon to wife: 

{4:12} Baana the sonof Ahilud; [to him pertained] Taanach and Megiddo, and all Beth-shean,which is by Zartanah beneath Jezreel, from Beth-shean to Abel-meholah,[even] unto [the place that is] beyond Jokneam: 

{4:13} The son ofGeber, in Ramoth-gilead; to him [pertained] the towns of Jair the sonof Manasseh, which [are] in Gilead; to him [also pertained] the regionof Argob, which is in Bashan, threescore great cities with walls andbrasen bars: 

{4:14} Ahinadab the son of Iddo [had] Mahanaim: 

{4:15}Ahimaaz [was] in Naphtali; he also took Basmath the daughter of Solomonto wife: 

{4:16} Baanah the son of Hushai [was] in Asher and in Aloth:

{4:17} Jehoshaphat the son of Paruah, in Issachar: 

{4:18} Shimei theson of Elah, in Benjamin: 

{4:19} Geber the son of Uri [was] in thecountry of Gilead, [in] the country of Sihon king of the Amorites, andof Og king of Bashan; and [he was] the only officer which [was] in theland.   

{4:20} Judah and Israel [were] many, as the sand which [is] by thesea in multitude, eating and drinking, and making merry. 

{4:21} AndSolomon reigned over all kingdoms from the river unto the land of thePhilistines, and unto the border of Egypt: they brought presents, andserved Solomon all the days of his life.   

{4:22} And Solomon's provision for one day was thirty measures offine flour, and threescore measures of meal, 

{4:23} Ten fat oxen, andtwenty oxen out of the pastures, and an hundred sheep, beside harts,and roebucks, and fallowdeer, and fatted fowl. 

{4:24} For he haddominion over all [the region] on this side the river, from Tiphsaheven to Azzah, over all the kings on this side the river: and he hadpeace on all sides round about him. 

{4:25} And Judah and Israel dweltsafely, every man under his vine and under his fig tree, from Dan evento Beer-sheba, all the days of Solomon.   

{4:26} And Solomon had forty thousand stalls of horses for hischariots, and twelve thousand horsemen. 

{4:27} And those officersprovided victual for king Solomon, and for all that came unto kingSolomon's table, every man in his month: they lacked nothing. 

{4:28}Barley also and straw for the horses and dromedaries brought they untothe place where [the officers] were, every man according to his charge.   

{4:29} And God gave Solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much,and largeness of heart, even as the sand that [is] on the sea shore.

{4:30} And Solomon's wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children ofthe east country, and all the wisdom of Egypt. 

{4:31} For he was wiserthan all men; than Ethan the Ezrahite, and Heman, and Chalcol, andDarda, the sons of Mahol: and his fame was in all nations round about.

{4:32} And he spake three thousand proverbs: and his songs were athousand and five. 

{4:33} And he spake of trees, from the cedar treethat [is] in Lebanon even unto the hyssop that springeth out of thewall: he spake also of beasts, and of fowl, and of creeping things, andof fishes. 

{4:34} And there came of all people to hear the wisdom ofSolomon, from all kings of the earth, which had heard of his wisdom.   

{5:1} And Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants unto Solomon; for hehad heard that they had anointed him king in the room of his father:for Hiram was ever a lover of David. 

{5:2} And Solomon sent to Hiram,saying, 

{5:3} Thou knowest how that David my father could not build anhouse unto the name of the LORD his God for the wars which were abouthim on every side, until the LORD put them under the soles of his feet.

{5:4} But now the LORD my God hath given me rest on every side, [sothat there is] neither adversary nor evil occurrent. 

{5:5} And, behold,I purpose to build an house unto the name of the LORD my God, as theLORD spake unto David my father, saying, Thy son, whom I will set uponthy throne in thy room, he shall build an house unto my name. 

{5:6} Nowtherefore command thou that they hew me cedar trees out of Lebanon; andmy servants shall be with thy servants: and unto thee will I give hirefor thy servants according to all that thou shalt appoint: for thouknowest that [there is] not among us any that can skill to hew timberlike unto the Sidonians.   

{5:7} And it came to pass, when Hiram heard the words of Solomon,that he rejoiced greatly, and said, Blessed [be] the LORD this day,which hath given unto David a wise son over this great people. 

{5:8}And Hiram sent to Solomon, saying, I have considered the things whichthou sentest to me for: [and] I will do all thy desire concerningtimber of cedar, and concerning timber of fir. 

{5:9} My servants shallbring [them] down from Lebanon unto the sea: and I will convey them bysea in floats unto the place that thou shalt appoint me, and will causethem to be discharged there, and thou shalt receive [them:] and thoushalt accomplish my desire, in giving food for my household. 

{5:10} SoHiram gave Solomon cedar trees and fir trees [according to] all hisdesire. 

{5:11} And Solomon gave Hiram twenty thousand measures of wheat[for] food to his household, and twenty measures of pure oil: thus gaveSolomon to Hiram year by year. 

{5:12} And the LORD gave Solomon wisdom,as he promised him: and there was peace between Hiram and Solomon; andthey two made a league together.   

{5:13} And king Solomon raised a levy out of all Israel; and thelevy was thirty thousand men. 

{5:14} And he sent them to Lebanon tenthousand a month by courses: a month they were in Lebanon, [and] twomonths at home: and Adoniram [was] over the levy. 

{5:15} And Solomonhad threescore and ten thousand that bare burdens, and fourscorethousand hewers in the mountains; 

{5:16} Beside the chief of Solomon'sofficers which [were] over the work, three thousand and three hundred,which ruled over the people that wrought in the work. 

{5:17} And theking commanded, and they brought great stones, costly stones, [and]hewed stones, to lay the foundation of the house. 

{5:18} And Solomon'sbuilders and Hiram's builders did hew [them,] and the stonesquarers: sothey prepared timber and stones to build the house.   

{6:1} And it came to pass in the four hundred and eightieth yearafter the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt, in thefourth year of Solomon's reign over Israel, in the month Zif, which[is] the second month, that he began to build the house of the LORD.

{6:2} And the house which king Solomon built for the LORD, the lengththereof [was] threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof twenty[cubits,] and the height thereof thirty cubits. 

{6:3} And the porchbefore the temple of the house, twenty cubits [was] the length thereof,according to the breadth of the house; [and] ten cubits [was] thebreadth thereof before the house. 

{6:4} And for the house he madewindows of narrow lights.   

{6:5} And against the wall of the house he built chambers roundabout, [against] the walls of the house round about, [both] of thetemple and of the oracle: and he made chambers round about: 

{6:6} Thenethermost chamber [was] five cubits broad, and the middle [was] sixcubits broad, and the third [was] seven cubits broad: for without [inthe wall] of the house he made narrowed rests round about, that [thebeams] should not be fastened in the walls of the house. 

{6:7} And thehouse, when it was in building, was built of stone made ready before itwas brought thither: so that there was neither hammer nor axe [nor] anytool of iron heard in the house, while it was in building. 

{6:8} Thedoor for the middle chamber [was] in the right side of the house: andthey went up with winding stairs into the middle [chamber,] and out ofthe middle into the third. 

{6:9} So he built the house, and finishedit; and covered the house with beams and boards of cedar. 

{6:10} And[then] he built chambers against all the house, five cubits high: andthey rested on the house [with] timber of cedar.   

{6:11} And the word of the LORD came to Solomon, saying, 

{6:12}[Concerning] this house which thou art in building, if thou wilt walkin my statutes, and execute my judgments, and keep all my commandmentsto walk in them; then will I perform my word with thee, which I spakeunto David thy father: 

{6:13} And I will dwell among the children ofIsrael, and will not forsake my people Israel. 

{6:14} So Solomon builtthe house, and finished it. 

{6:15} And he built the walls of the housewithin with boards of cedar, both the floor of the house, and the wallsof the cieling: [and] he covered [them] on the inside with wood, andcovered the floor of the house with planks of fir. 

{6:16} And he builttwenty cubits on the sides of the house, both the floor and the wallswith boards of cedar: he even built [them] for it within, [even] forthe oracle, [even] for the most holy [place. ]

{6:17} And the house,that [is,] the temple before it, was forty cubits [long. ]

{6:18} Andthe cedar of the house within [was] carved with knops and open flowers:all [was] cedar; there was no stone seen. 

{6:19} And the oracle heprepared in the house within, to set there the ark of the covenant ofthe LORD. 

{6:20} And the oracle in the forepart [was] twenty cubits inlength, and twenty cubits in breadth, and twenty cubits in the heightthereof: and he overlaid it with pure gold; and so covered the altar[which was of] cedar. 

{6:21} So Solomon overlaid the house within withpure gold: and he made a partition by the chains of gold before theoracle; and he overlaid it with gold. 

{6:22} And the whole house heoverlaid with gold, until he had finished all the house: also the wholealtar that [was] by the oracle he overlaid with gold.   

{6:23} And within the oracle he made two cherubims [of] olive tree,[each] ten cubits high. 

{6:24} And five cubits [was] the one wing ofthe cherub, and five cubits the other wing of the cherub: from theuttermost part of the one wing unto the uttermost part of the other[were] ten cubits. 

{6:25} And the other cherub [was] ten cubits: boththe cherubims [were] of one measure and one size. 

{6:26} The height ofthe one cherub [was] ten cubits, and so [was it] of the other cherub.

{6:27} And he set the cherubims within the inner house: and theystretched forth the wings of the cherubims, so that the wing of the onetouched the [one] wall, and the wing of the other cherub touched theother wall; and their wings touched one another in the midst of thehouse. 

{6:28} And he overlaid the cherubims with gold. 

{6:29} And hecarved all the walls of the house round about with carved figures ofcherubims and palm trees and open flowers, within and without. 

{6:30}And the floor of the house he overlaid with gold, within and without.   

{6:31} And for the entering of the oracle he made doors [of] olivetree: the lintel [and] side posts [were] a fifth part [of the wall.]

{6:32} The two doors also [were of] olive tree; and he carved uponthem carvings of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers, andoverlaid [them] with gold, and spread gold upon the cherubims, and uponthe palm trees. 

{6:33} So also made he for the door of the temple postsof olive tree, a fourth part [of the wall. ]

{6:34} And the two doors[were of] fir tree: the two leaves of the one door [were] folding, andthe two leaves of the other door [were] folding. 

{6:35} And he carved[thereon] cherubims and palm trees and open flowers: and covered [them]with gold fitted upon the carved work.   

{6:36} And he built the inner court with three rows of hewed stone,and a row of cedar beams.   

{6:37} In the fourth year was the foundation of the house of theLORD laid, in the month Zif: 

{6:38} And in the eleventh year, in themonth Bul, which [is] the eighth month, was the house finishedthroughout all the parts thereof, and according to all the fashion ofit. So was he seven years in building it.   

{7:1} But Solomon was building his own house thirteen years, and hefinished all his house.   

{7:2} He built also the house of the forest of Lebanon; the lengththereof [was] an hundred cubits, and the breadth thereof fifty cubits,and the height thereof thirty cubits, upon four rows of cedar pillars,with cedar beams upon the pillars. 

{7:3} And [it was] covered withcedar above upon the beams, that [lay] on forty five pillars, fifteen[in] a row. 

{7:4} And [there were] windows [in] three rows, and light[was] against light [in] three ranks. 

{7:5} And all the doors and posts[were] square, with the windows: and light [was] against light [in]three ranks.   

{7:6} And he made a porch of pillars; the length thereof [was] fiftycubits, and the breadth thereof thirty cubits: and the porch was beforethem: and the [other] pillars and the thick beam [were] before them.   

{7:7} Then he made a porch for the throne where he might judge,[even] the porch of judgment: and [it was] covered with cedar from oneside of the floor to the other.   

{7:8} And his house where he dwelt [had] another court within theporch, [which] was of the like work. Solomon made also an house forPharaoh's daughter, whom he had taken [to wife,] like unto this porch.

{7:9} All these [were of] costly stones, according to the measures ofhewed stones, sawed with saws, within and without, even from thefoundation unto the coping, and so on the outside toward the greatcourt. 

{7:10} And the foundation [was of] costly stones, even greatstones, stones of ten cubits, and stones of eight cubits. 

{7:11} Andabove [were] costly stones, after the measures of hewed stones, andcedars. 

{7:12} And the great court round about [was] with three rows ofhewed stones, and a row of cedar beams, both for the inner court of thehouse of the LORD, and for the porch of the house.   

{7:13} And king Solomon sent and fetched Hiram out of Tyre. 

{7:14}He [was] a widow's son of the tribe of Naphtali, and his father [was] aman of Tyre, a worker in brass: and he was filled with wisdom, andunderstanding, and cunning to work all works in brass. And he came toking Solomon, and wrought all his work. 

{7:15} For he cast two pillarsof brass, of eighteen cubits high apiece: and a line of twelve cubitsdid compass either of them about. 

{7:16} And he made two chapiters [of]molten brass, to set upon the tops of the pillars: the height of theone chapiter [was] five cubits, and the height of the other chapiter[was] five cubits: 

{7:17} [And] nets of checker work, and wreaths ofchain work, for the chapiters which [were] upon the top of the pillars;seven for the one chapiter, and seven for the other chapiter. 

{7:18}And he made the pillars, and two rows round about upon the one network,to cover the chapiters that [were] upon the top, with pomegranates: andso did he for the other chapiter. 

{7:19} And the chapiters that [were]upon the top of the pillars [were] of lily work in the porch, fourcubits. 

{7:20} And the chapiters upon the two pillars [hadpomegranates] also above, over against the belly which [was] by thenetwork: and the pomegranates [were] two hundred in rows round aboutupon the other chapiter. 

{7:21} And he set up the pillars in the porchof the temple: and he set up the right pillar, and called the namethereof Jachin: and he set up the left pillar, and he called the namethereof Boaz. 

{7:22} And upon the top of the pillars [was] lily work:so was the work of the pillars finished.   

{7:23} And he made a molten sea, ten cubits from the one brim to theother: [it was] round all about, and his height [was] five cubits: anda line of thirty cubits did compass it round about. 

{7:24} And underthe brim of it round about [there were] knops compassing it, ten in acubit, compassing the sea round about: the knops [were] cast in tworows, when it was cast. 

{7:25} It stood upon twelve oxen, three lookingtoward the north, and three looking toward the west, and three lookingtoward the south, and three looking toward the east: and the sea [wasset] above upon them, and all their hinder parts [were] inward. 

{7:26}And it [was] an hand breadth thick, and the brim thereof was wroughtlike the brim of a cup, with flowers of lilies: it contained twothousand baths.   

{7:27} And he made ten bases of brass; four cubits [was] the lengthof one base, and four cubits the breadth thereof, and three cubits theheight of it. 

{7:28} And the work of the bases [was] on this [manner:]they had borders, and the borders [were] between the ledges: 

{7:29} Andon the borders that [were] between the ledges [were] lions, oxen, andcherubims: and upon the ledges [there was] a base above: and beneaththe lions and oxen [were] certain additions made of thin work. 

{7:30}And every base had four brasen wheels, and plates of brass: and thefour corners thereof had undersetters: under the laver [were]undersetters molten, at the side of every addition. 

{7:31} And themouth of it within the chapiter and above [was] a cubit: but the mouththereof [was] round [after] the work of the base, a cubit and an half:and also upon the mouth of it [were] gravings with their borders,foursquare, not round. 

{7:32} And under the borders [were] four wheels;and the axletrees of the wheels [were joined] to the base: and theheight of a wheel [was] a cubit and a half a cubit. 

{7:33} And the workof the wheels was like the work of a chariot wheel: their axletrees,and their naves, and their felloes, and their spokes, [were] allmolten. 

{7:34} And [there were] four undersetters to the four cornersof one base: [and] the undersetters [were] of the very base itself.

{7:35} And in the top of the base [was there] a round compass of half acubit high: and on the top of the base the ledges thereof and theborders thereof [were] of the same. 

{7:36} For on the plates of theledges thereof, and on the borders thereof, he graved cherubims, lions,and palm trees, according to the proportion of every one, and additionsround about. 

{7:37} After this [manner] he made the ten bases: all ofthem had one casting, one measure, [and] one size.   

{7:38} Then made he ten lavers of brass: one laver contained fortybaths: [and] every laver was four cubits: [and] upon every one of theten bases one laver. 

{7:39} And he put five bases on the right side ofthe house, and five on the left side of the house: and he set the seaon the right side of the house eastward over against the south.   

{7:40} And Hiram made the lavers, and the shovels, and the basons.So Hiram made an end of doing all the work that he made king Solomonfor the house of the LORD: 

{7:41} The two pillars, and the [two] bowlsof the chapiters that [were] on the top of the two pillars; and the twonetworks, to cover the two bowls of the chapiters which [were] upon thetop of the pillars; 

{7:42} And four hundred pomegranates for the twonetworks, [even] two rows of pomegranates for one network, to cover thetwo bowls of the chapiters that [were] upon the pillars; 

{7:43} And theten bases, and ten lavers on the bases; 

{7:44} And one sea, and twelveoxen under the sea; 

{7:45} And the pots, and the shovels, and thebasons: and all these vessels, which Hiram made to king Solomon for thehouse of the LORD, [were of] bright brass. 

{7:46} In the plain ofJordan did the king cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth andZarthan. 

{7:47} And Solomon left all the vessels [unweighed,] becausethey were exceeding many: neither was the weight of the brass foundout. 

{7:48} And Solomon made all the vessels that [pertained] unto thehouse of the LORD: the altar of gold, and the table of gold, whereuponthe shewbread [was, ]

{7:49} And the candlesticks of pure gold, five onthe right [side,] and five on the left, before the oracle, with theflowers, and the lamps, and the tongs [of] gold, 

{7:50} And the bowls,and the snuffers, and the basons, and the spoons, and the censers [of]pure gold; and the hinges [of] gold, [both] for the doors of the innerhouse, the most holy [place, and] for the doors of the house, [to wit,]of the temple. 

{7:51} So was ended all the work that king Solomon madefor the house of the LORD. And Solomon brought in the things whichDavid his father had dedicated; [even] the silver, and the gold, andthe vessels, did he put among the treasures of the house of the LORD.   

{8:1} Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the headsof the tribes, the chief of the fathers of the children of Israel, untoking Solomon in Jerusalem, that they might bring up the ark of thecovenant of the LORD out of the city of David, which [is] Zion. 

{8:2}And all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto king Solomon at thefeast in the month Ethanim, which [is] the seventh month. 

{8:3} And allthe elders of Israel came, and the priests took up the ark. 

{8:4} Andthey brought up the ark of the LORD, and the tabernacle of thecongregation, and all the holy vessels that [were] in the tabernacle,even those did the priests and the Levites bring up. 

{8:5} And kingSolomon, and all the congregation of Israel, that [were] assembled untohim, were with him before the ark, sacrificing sheep and oxen, thatcould not be told nor numbered for multitude. 

{8:6} And the priestsbrought in the ark of the covenant of the LORD unto his place, into theoracle of the house, to the most holy [place, even] under the wings ofthe cherubims. 

{8:7} For the cherubims spread forth [their] two wingsover the place of the ark, and the cherubims covered the ark and thestaves thereof above. 

{8:8} And they drew out the staves, that the endsof the staves were seen out in the holy [place] before the oracle, andthey were not seen without: and there they are unto this day. 

{8:9}[There was] nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone, whichMoses put there at Horeb, when the LORD made [a covenant] with thechildren of Israel, when they came out of the land of Egypt. 

{8:10} Andit came to pass, when the priests were come out of the holy [place,]that the cloud filled the house of the LORD, 

{8:11} So that the priestscould not stand to minister because of the cloud: for the glory of theLORD had filled the house of the LORD.   

{8:12} Then spake Solomon, The LORD said that he would dwell inthick darkness. 

{8:13} I have surely built thee an house to dwell in, asettled place for thee to abide in for ever. 

{8:14} And the king turnedhis face about, and blessed all the congregation of Israel: (and allthe congregation of Israel stood;) 

{8:15} And he said, Blessed [be] theLORD God of Israel, which spake with his mouth unto David my father,and hath with his hand fulfilled [it,] saying, 

{8:16} Since the daythat I brought forth my people Israel out of Egypt, I chose no city outof all the tribes of Israel to build an house, that my name might betherein; but I chose David to be over my people Israel. 

{8:17} And itwas in the heart of David my father to build an house for the name ofthe LORD God of Israel. 

{8:18} And the LORD said unto David my father,Whereas it was in thine heart to build an house unto my name, thoudidst well that it was in thine heart. 

{8:19} Nevertheless thou shaltnot build the house; but thy son that shall come forth out of thyloins, he shall build the house unto my name. 

{8:20} And the LORD hathperformed his word that he spake, and I am risen up in the room ofDavid my father, and sit on the throne of Israel, as the LORD promised,and have built an house for the name of the LORD God of Israel. 

{8:21}And I have set there a place for the ark, wherein [is] the covenant ofthe LORD, which he made with our fathers, when he brought them out ofthe land of Egypt.   

{8:22} And Solomon stood before the altar of the LORD in thepresence of all the congregation of Israel, and spread forth his handstoward heaven: 

{8:23} And he said, LORD God of Israel, [there is] noGod like thee, in heaven above, or on earth beneath, who keepestcovenant and mercy with thy servants that walk before thee with alltheir heart: 

{8:24} Who hast kept with thy servant David my father thatthou promisedst him: thou spakest also with thy mouth, and hastfulfilled [it] with thine hand, as [it is] this day. 

{8:25} Thereforenow, LORD God of Israel, keep with thy servant David my father thatthou promisedst him, saying, There shall not fail thee a man in mysight to sit on the throne of Israel; so that thy children take heed totheir way, that they walk before me as thou hast walked before me.

{8:26} And now, O God of Israel, let thy word, I pray thee, beverified, which thou spakest unto thy servant David my father. 

{8:27}But will God indeed dwell on the earth? behold, the heaven and heavenof heavens cannot contain thee; how much less this house that I havebuilded? 

{8:28} Yet have thou respect unto the prayer of thy servant,and to his supplication, O LORD my God, to hearken unto the cry and tothe prayer, which thy servant prayeth before thee to day: 

{8:29} Thatthine eyes may be open toward this house night and day, [even] towardthe place of which thou hast said, My name shall be there: that thoumayest hearken unto the prayer which thy servant shall make toward thisplace. 

{8:30} And hearken thou to the supplication of thy servant, andof thy people Israel, when they shall pray toward this place: and hearthou in heaven thy dwelling place: and when thou hearest, forgive.   

{8:31} If any man trespass against his neighbour, and an oath belaid upon him to cause him to swear, and the oath come before thinealtar in this house: 

{8:32} Then hear thou in heaven, and do, and judgethy servants, condemning the wicked, to bring his way upon his head;and justifying the righteous, to give him according to hisrighteousness.   

{8:33} When thy people Israel be smitten down before the enemy,because they have sinned against thee, and shall turn again to thee,and confess thy name, and pray, and make supplication unto thee in thishouse: 

{8:34} Then hear thou in heaven, and forgive the sin of thypeople Israel, and bring them again unto the land which thou gavestunto their fathers.   

{8:35} When heaven is shut up, and there is no rain, because theyhave sinned against thee; if they pray toward this place, and confessthy name, and turn from their sin, when thou afflictest them: 

{8:36}Then hear thou in heaven, and forgive the sin of thy servants, and ofthy people Israel, that thou teach them the good way wherein theyshould walk, and give rain upon thy land, which thou hast given to thypeople for an inheritance.   

{8:37} If there be in the land famine, if there be pestilence,blasting, mildew, locust, [or] if there be caterpiller; if their enemybesiege them in the land of their cities; whatsoever plague, whatsoeversickness [there be; ]

{8:38} What prayer and supplication soever be[made] by any man, [or] by all thy people Israel, which shall knowevery man the plague of his own heart, and spread forth his handstoward this house: 

{8:39} Then hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place,and forgive, and do, and give to every man according to his ways, whoseheart thou knowest; (for thou, [even] thou only, knowest the hearts ofall the children of men;) 

{8:40} That they may fear thee all the daysthat they live in the land which thou gavest unto our fathers. 

{8:41}Moreover concerning a stranger, that [is] not of thy people Israel, butcometh out of a far country for thy name's sake; 

{8:42} (For they shallhear of thy great name, and of thy strong hand, and of thy stretchedout arm;) when he shall come and pray toward this house; 

{8:43} Hearthou in heaven thy dwelling place, and do according to all that thestranger calleth to thee for: that all people of the earth may know thyname, to fear thee, as [do] thy people Israel; and that they may knowthat this house, which I have builded, is called by thy name.   

{8:44} If thy people go out to battle against their enemy,whithersoever thou shalt send them, and shall pray unto the LORD towardthe city which thou hast chosen, and [toward] the house that I havebuilt for thy name: 

{8:45} Then hear thou in heaven their prayer andtheir supplication, and maintain their cause. 

{8:46} If they sinagainst thee, (for [there is] no man that sinneth not,) and thou beangry with them, and deliver them to the enemy, so that they carry themaway captives unto the land of the enemy, far or near; 

{8:47} [Yet] ifthey shall bethink themselves in the land whither they were carriedcaptives, and repent, and make supplication unto thee in the land ofthem that carried them captives, saying, We have sinned, and have doneperversely, we have committed wickedness; 

{8:48} And [so] return untothee with all their heart, and with all their soul, in the land oftheir enemies, which led them away captive, and pray unto thee towardtheir land, which thou gavest unto their fathers, the city which thouhast chosen, and the house which I have built for thy name: 

{8:49} Thenhear thou their prayer and their supplication in heaven thy dwellingplace, and maintain their cause, 

{8:50} And forgive thy people thathave sinned against thee and all their transgressions wherein they havetransgressed against thee, and give them compassion before them whocarried them captive, that they may have compassion on them: 

{8:51} Forthey [be] thy people, and thine inheritance, which thou broughtestforth out of Egypt, from the midst of the furnace of iron: 

{8:52} Thatthine eyes may be open unto the supplication of thy servant, and untothe supplication of thy people Israel, to hearken unto them in all thatthey call for unto thee. 

{8:53} For thou didst separate them from amongall the people of the earth, [to be] thine inheritance, as thou spakestby the hand of Moses thy servant, when thou broughtest our fathers outof Egypt, O Lord GOD. 

{8:54} And it was [so,] that when Solomon hadmade an end of praying all this prayer and supplication unto the LORD,he arose from before the altar of the LORD, from kneeling on his kneeswith his hands spread up to heaven. 

{8:55} And he stood, and blessedall the congregation of Israel with a loud voice, saying, 

{8:56}Blessed [be] the LORD, that hath given rest unto his people Israel,according to all that he promised: there hath not failed one word ofall his good promise, which he promised by the hand of Moses hisservant. 

{8:57} The LORD our God be with us, as he was with ourfathers: let him not leave us, nor forsake us: 

{8:58} That he mayincline our hearts unto him, to walk in all his ways, and to keep hiscommandments, and his statutes, and his judgments, which he commandedour fathers. 

{8:59} And let these my words, wherewith I have madesupplication before the LORD, be nigh unto the LORD our God day andnight, that he maintain the cause of his servant, and the cause of hispeople Israel at all times, as the matter shall require: 

{8:60} Thatall the people of the earth may know that the LORD [is] God, [and thatthere is] none else. 

{8:61} Let your heart therefore be perfect withthe LORD our God, to walk in his statutes, and to keep hiscommandments, as at this day.   

{8:62} And the king, and all Israel with him, offered sacrificebefore the LORD. 

{8:63} And Solomon offered a sacrifice of peaceofferings, which he offered unto the LORD, two and twenty thousandoxen, and an hundred and twenty thousand sheep. So the king and all thechildren of Israel dedicated the house of the LORD. 

{8:64} The same daydid the king hallow the middle of the court that [was] before the houseof the LORD: for there he offered burnt offerings, and meat offerings,and the fat of the peace offerings: because the brasen altar that [was]before the LORD [was] too little to receive the burnt offerings, andmeat offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings. 

{8:65} And at thattime Solomon held a feast, and all Israel with him, a greatcongregation, from the entering in of Hamath unto the river of Egypt,before the LORD our God, seven days and seven days, [even] fourteendays. 

{8:66} On the eighth day he sent the people away: and theyblessed the king, and went unto their tents joyful and glad of heartfor all the goodness that the LORD had done for David his servant, andfor Israel his people.   

{9:1} And it came to pass, when Solomon had finished the building ofthe house of the LORD, and the king's house, and all Solomon's desirewhich he was pleased to do, 

{9:2} That the LORD appeared to Solomon thesecond time, as he had appeared unto him at Gibeon. 

{9:3} And the LORDsaid unto him, I have heard thy prayer and thy supplication, that thouhast made before me: I have hallowed this house, which thou hast built,to put my name there for ever; and mine eyes and mine heart shall bethere perpetually. 

{9:4} And if thou wilt walk before me, as David thyfather walked, in integrity of heart, and in uprightness, to doaccording to all that I have commanded thee, [and] wilt keep mystatutes and my judgments: 

{9:5} Then I will establish the throne ofthy kingdom upon Israel for ever, as I promised to David thy father,saying, There shall not fail thee a man upon the throne of Israel.

{9:6} [But] if ye shall at all turn from following me, ye or yourchildren, and will not keep my commandments [and] my statutes which Ihave set before you, but go and serve other gods, and worship them:

{9:7} Then will I cut off Israel out of the land which I have giventhem; and this house, which I have hallowed for my name, will I castout of my sight; and Israel shall be a proverb and a byword among allpeople: 

{9:8} And at this house, [which] is high, every one thatpasseth by it shall be astonished, and shall hiss; and they shall say,Why hath the LORD done thus unto this land, and to this house? 

{9:9}And they shall answer, Because they forsook the LORD their God, whobrought forth their fathers out of the land of Egypt, and have takenhold upon other gods, and have worshipped them, and served them:therefore hath the LORD brought upon them all this evil.   

{9:10} And it came to pass at the end of twenty years, when Solomonhad built the two houses, the house of the LORD, and the king's house,

{9:11} ([Now] Hiram the king of Tyre had furnished Solomon with cedartrees and fir trees, and with gold, according to all his desire,) thatthen king Solomon gave Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee.

{9:12} And Hiram came out from Tyre to see the cities which Solomon hadgiven him; and they pleased him not. 

{9:13} And he said, What cities[are] these which thou hast given me, my brother? And he called themthe land of Cabul unto this day. 

{9:14} And Hiram sent to the kingsixscore talents of gold.   

{9:15} And this [is] the reason of the levy which king Solomonraised; for to build the house of the LORD, and his own house, andMillo, and the wall of Jerusalem, and Hazor, and Megiddo, and Gezer.

{9:16} [For] Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up, and taken Gezer, andburnt it with fire, and slain the Canaanites that dwelt in the city,and given it [for] a present unto his daughter, Solomon's wife. 

{9:17}And Solomon built Gezer, and Beth-horon the nether, 

{9:18} and Baalath,and Tadmor in the wilderness, in the land, 

{9:19} And all the cities ofstore that Solomon had, and cities for his chariots, and cities for hishorsemen, and that which Solomon desired to build in Jerusalem, and inLebanon, and in all the land of his dominion. 

{9:20} [And] all thepeople [that were] left of the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites,and Jebusites, which [were] not of the children of Israel, 

{9:21} Theirchildren that were left after them in the land, whom the children ofIsrael also were not able utterly to destroy, upon those did Solomonlevy a tribute of bondservice unto this day. 

{9:22} But of the childrenof Israel did Solomon make no bondmen: but they [were] men of war, andhis servants, and his princes, and his captains, and rulers of hischariots, and his horsemen. 

{9:23} These [were] the chief of theofficers that [were] over Solomon's work, five hundred and fifty, whichbare rule over the people that wrought in the work.   

{9:24} But Pharaoh's daughter came up out of the city of David untoher house which [Solomon] had built for her: then did he build Millo.   

{9:25} And three times in a year did Solomon offer burnt offeringsand peace offerings upon the altar which he built unto the LORD, and heburnt incense upon the altar that [was] before the LORD. So he finishedthe house.   

{9:26} And king Solomon made a navy of ships in Ezion-geber, whichis beside Eloth, on the shore of the Red sea, in the land of Edom.

{9:27} And Hiram sent in the navy his servants, shipmen that hadknowledge of the sea, with the servants of Solomon. 

{9:28} And theycame to Ophir, and fetched from thence gold, four hundred and twentytalents, and brought [it] to king Solomon.   

{10:1} And when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomonconcerning the name of the LORD, she came to prove him with hardquestions. 

{10:2} And she came to Jerusalem with a very great train,with camels that bare spices, and very much gold, and precious stones:and when she was come to Solomon, she communed with him of all that wasin her heart. 

{10:3} And Solomon told her all her questions: there wasnot [any] thing hid from the king, which he told her not. 

{10:4} Andwhen the queen of Sheba had seen all Solomon's wisdom, and the housethat he had built, 

{10:5} And the meat of his table, and the sitting ofhis servants, and the attendance of his ministers, and their apparel,and his cupbearers, and his ascent by which he went up unto the houseof the LORD; there was no more spirit in her. 

{10:6} And she said tothe king, It was a true report that I heard in mine own land of thyacts and of thy wisdom. 

{10:7} Howbeit I believed not the words, untilI came, and mine eyes had seen [it:] and, behold, the half was not toldme: thy wisdom and prosperity exceedeth the fame which I heard. 

{10:8}Happy [are] thy men, happy [are] these thy servants, which standcontinually before thee, [and] that hear thy wisdom. 

{10:9} Blessed bethe LORD thy God, which delighted in thee, to set thee on the throne ofIsrael: because the LORD loved Israel for ever, therefore made he theeking, to do judgment and justice. 

{10:10} And she gave the king anhundred and twenty talents of gold, and of spices very great store, andprecious stones: there came no more such abundance of spices as thesewhich the queen of Sheba gave to king Solomon. 

{10:11} And the navyalso of Hiram, that brought gold from Ophir, brought in from Ophirgreat plenty of almug trees, and precious stones. 

{10:12} And the kingmade of the almug trees pillars for the house of the LORD, and for theking's house, harps also and psalteries for singers: there came no suchalmug trees, nor were seen unto this day. 

{10:13} And king Solomon gaveunto the queen of Sheba all her desire, whatsoever she asked, beside[that] which Solomon gave her of his royal bounty. So she turned andwent to her own country, she and her servants.   

{10:14} Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year wassix hundred threescore and six talents of gold. 

{10:15} Beside [that hehad] of the merchantmen, and of the traffick of the spice merchants,and of all the kings of Arabia, and of the governors of the country.   

{10:16} And king Solomon made two hundred targets of beaten gold:six hundred [shekels] of gold went to one target. 

{10:17} And he madethree hundred shields of beaten gold; three pound of gold went to oneshield: and the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon.   

{10:18} Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaidit with the best gold. 

{10:19} The throne had six steps, and the top ofthe throne [was] round behind: and [there were] stays on either side onthe place of the seat, and two lions stood beside the stays. 

{10:20}And twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other upon thesix steps: there was not the like made in any kingdom.   

{10:21} And all king Solomon's drinking vessels [were of] gold, andall the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon [were of] puregold; none [were of] silver: it was nothing accounted of in the days ofSolomon. 

{10:22} For the king had at sea a navy of Tharshish with thenavy of Hiram: once in three years came the navy of Tharshish, bringinggold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks. 

{10:23} So kingSolomon exceeded all the kings of the earth for riches and for wisdom.   

{10:24} And all the earth sought to Solomon, to hear his wisdom,which God had put in his heart. 

{10:25} And they brought every man hispresent, vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and garments, andarmour, and spices, horses, and mules, a rate year by year.   

{10:26} And Solomon gathered together chariots and horsemen: and hehad a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen,whom he bestowed in the cities for chariots, and with the king atJerusalem. 

{10:27} And the king made silver [to be] in Jerusalem asstones, and cedars made he [to be] as the sycomore trees that [are] inthe vale, for abundance.   

{10:28} And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt, and linen yarn:the king's merchants received the linen yarn at a price. 

{10:29} And achariot came up and went out of Egypt for six hundred [shekels] ofsilver, and an horse for an hundred and fifty: and so for all the kingsof the Hittites, and for the kings of Syria, did they bring [them] outby their means.   

{11:1} But king Solomon loved many strange women, together with thedaughter of Pharaoh, women of the Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites,Zidonians, [and] Hittites; 

{11:2} Of the nations [concerning] which theLORD said unto the children of Israel, Ye shall not go in to them,neither shall they come in unto you: [for] surely they will turn awayyour heart after their gods: Solomon clave unto these in love. 

{11:3}And he had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundredconcubines: and his wives turned away his heart. 

{11:4} For it came topass, when Solomon was old, [that] his wives turned away his heartafter other gods: and his heart was not perfect with the LORD his God,as [was] the heart of David his father. 

{11:5} For Solomon went afterAshtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians, and after Milcom theabomination of the Ammonites. 

{11:6} And Solomon did evil in the sightof the LORD, and went not fully after the LORD, as [did] David hisfather. 

{11:7} Then did Solomon build an high place for Chemosh, theabomination of Moab, in the hill that [is] before Jerusalem, and forMolech, the abomination of the children of Ammon. 

{11:8} And likewisedid he for all his strange wives, which burnt incense and sacrificedunto their gods. 

{11:9} And the LORD was angry with Solomon, becausehis heart was turned from the LORD God of Israel, which had appearedunto him twice, 

{11:10} And had commanded him concerning this thing,that he should not go after other gods: but he kept not that which theLORD commanded. 

{11:11} Wherefore the LORD said unto Solomon, Forasmuchas this is done of thee, and thou hast not kept my covenant and mystatutes, which I have commanded thee, I will surely rend the kingdomfrom thee, and will give it to thy servant. 

{11:12} Notwithstanding inthy days I will not do it for David thy father's sake: [but] I willrend it out of the hand of thy son. 

{11:13} Howbeit I will not rendaway all the kingdom; [but] will give one tribe to thy son for David myservant's sake, and for Jerusalem's sake which I have chosen.   

{11:14} And the LORD stirred up an adversary unto Solomon, Hadad theEdomite: he [was] of the king's seed in Edom. 

{11:15} For it came topass, when David was in Edom, and Joab the captain of the host was goneup to bury the slain, after he had smitten every male in Edom; 

{11:16}(For six months did Joab remain there with all Israel, until he had cutoff every male in Edom:) 

{11:17} That Hadad fled, he and certainEdomites of his father's servants with him, to go into Egypt; Hadad[being] yet a little child. 

{11:18} And they arose out of Midian, andcame to Paran: and they took men with them out of Paran, and they cameto Egypt, unto Pharaoh king of Egypt; which gave him an house, andappointed him victuals, and gave him land. 

{11:19} And Hadad foundgreat favour in the sight of Pharaoh, so that he gave him to wife thesister of his own wife, the sister of Tahpenes the queen. 

{11:20} Andthe sister of Tahpenes bare him Genubath his son, whom Tahpenes weanedin Pharaoh's house: and Genubath was in Pharaoh's household among thesons of Pharaoh. 

{11:21} And when Hadad heard in Egypt that David sleptwith his fathers, and that Joab the captain of the host was dead, Hadadsaid to Pharaoh, Let me depart, that I may go to mine own country.

{11:22} Then Pharaoh said unto him, But what hast thou lacked with me,that, behold, thou seekest to go to thine own country? And he answered,Nothing: howbeit let me go in any wise.   

{11:23} And God stirred him up [another] adversary, Rezon the son ofEliadah, which fled from his lord Hadadezer king of Zobah: 

{11:24} Andhe gathered men unto him, and became captain over a band, when Davidslew them [of Zobah:] and they went to Damascus, and dwelt therein, andreigned in Damascus. 

{11:25} And he was an adversary to Israel all thedays of Solomon, beside the mischief that Hadad [did:] and he abhorredIsrael, and reigned over Syria.   

{11:26} And Jeroboam the son of Nebat, an Ephrathite of Zereda,Solomon's servant, whose mother's name [was] Zeruah, a widow woman,even he lifted up [his] hand against the king. 

{11:27} And this [was]the cause that he lifted up [his] hand against the king: Solomon builtMillo, [and] repaired the breaches of the city of David his father.

{11:28} And the man Jeroboam [was] a mighty man of valour: and Solomonseeing the young man that he was industrious, he made him ruler overall the charge of the house of Joseph. 

{11:29} And it came to pass atthat time when Jeroboam went out of Jerusalem, that the prophet Ahijahthe Shilonite found him in the way; and he had clad himself with a newgarment; and they two [were] alone in the field: 

{11:30} And Ahijahcaught the new garment that [was] on him, and rent it [in] twelvepieces: 

{11:31} And he said to Jeroboam, Take thee ten pieces: for thussaith the LORD, the God of Israel, Behold, I will rend the kingdom outof the hand of Solomon, and will give ten tribes to thee: 

{11:32} (Buthe shall have one tribe for my servant David's sake, and forJerusalem's sake, the city which I have chosen out of all the tribes ofIsrael:) 

{11:33} Because that they have forsaken me, and haveworshipped Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians, Chemosh the god ofthe Moabites, and Milcom the god of the children of Ammon, and have notwalked in my ways, to do [that which is] right in mine eyes, and [tokeep] my statutes and my judgments, as [did] David his father. 

{11:34}Howbeit I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand: but I willmake him prince all the days of his life for David my servant's sake,whom I chose, because he kept my commandments and my statutes: 

{11:35}But I will take the kingdom out of his son's hand, and will give itunto thee, [even] ten tribes. 

{11:36} And unto his son will I give onetribe, that David my servant may have a light alway before me inJerusalem, the city which I have chosen me to put my name there.

{11:37} And I will take thee, and thou shalt reign according to allthat thy soul desireth, and shalt be king over Israel. 

{11:38} And itshall be, if thou wilt hearken unto all that I command thee, and wiltwalk in my ways, and do [that is] right in my sight, to keep mystatutes and my commandments, as David my servant did; that I will bewith thee, and build thee a sure house, as I built for David, and willgive Israel unto thee. 

{11:39} And I will for this afflict the seed ofDavid, but not for ever. 

{11:40} Solomon sought therefore to killJeroboam. And Jeroboam arose, and fled into Egypt, unto Shishak king ofEgypt, and was in Egypt until the death of Solomon.   

{11:41} And the rest of the acts of Solomon, and all that he did,and his wisdom, [are] they not written in the book of the acts ofSolomon? 

{11:42} And the time that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem overall Israel [was] forty years. 

{11:43} And Solomon slept with hisfathers, and was buried in the city of David his father: and Rehoboamhis son reigned in his stead.   

{12:1} And Rehoboam went to Shechem: for all Israel were come toShechem to make him king. 

{12:2} And it came to pass, when Jeroboam theson of Nebat, who was yet in Egypt, heard [of it,] (for he was fledfrom the presence of king Solomon, and Jeroboam dwelt in Egypt;) 

{12:3}That they sent and called him. And Jeroboam and all the congregation ofIsrael came, and spake unto Rehoboam, saying, 

{12:4} Thy father madeour yoke grievous: now therefore make thou the grievous service of thyfather, and his heavy yoke which he put upon us, lighter, and we willserve thee. 

{12:5} And he said unto them, Depart yet [for] three days,then come again to me. And the people departed.   

{12:6} And king Rehoboam consulted with the old men, that stoodbefore Solomon his father while he yet lived, and said, How do yeadvise that I may answer this people? 

{12:7} And they spake unto him,saying, If thou wilt be a servant unto this people this day, and wiltserve them, and answer them, and speak good words to them, then theywill be thy servants for ever. 

{12:8} But he forsook the counsel of theold men, which they had given him, and consulted with the young menthat were grown up with him, [and] which stood before him: 

{12:9} Andhe said unto them, What counsel give ye that we may answer this people,who have spoken to me, saying, Make the yoke which thy father did putupon us lighter? 

{12:10} And the young men that were grown up with himspake unto him, saying, Thus shalt thou speak unto this people thatspake unto thee, saying, Thy father made our yoke heavy, but make thou[it] lighter unto us; thus shalt thou say unto them, My little [finger]shall be thicker than my father's loins. 

{12:11} And now whereas myfather did lade you with a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke: myfather hath chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you withscorpions.   

{12:12} So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the thirdday, as the king had appointed, saying, Come to me again the third day.

{12:13} And the king answered the people roughly, and forsook the oldmen's counsel that they gave him; 

{12:14} And spake to them after thecounsel of the young men, saying, My father made your yoke heavy, and Iwill add to your yoke: my father [also] chastised you with whips, but Iwill chastise you with scorpions. 

{12:15} Wherefore the king hearkenednot unto the people; for the cause was from the LORD, that he mightperform his saying, which the LORD spake by Ahijah the Shilonite untoJeroboam the son of Nebat.   

{12:16} So when all Israel saw that the king hearkened not untothem, the people answered the king, saying, What portion have we inDavid? neither [have we] inheritance in the son of Jesse: to yourtents, O Israel: now see to thine own house, David. So Israel departedunto their tents. 

{12:17} But [as for] the children of Israel whichdwelt in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them. 

{12:18} Thenking Rehoboam sent Adoram, who [was] over the tribute; and all Israelstoned him with stones, that he died. Therefore king Rehoboam madespeed to get him up to his chariot, to flee to Jerusalem. 

{12:19} SoIsrael rebelled against the house of David unto this day. 

{12:20} Andit came to pass, when all Israel heard that Jeroboam was come again,that they sent and called him unto the congregation, and made him kingover all Israel: there was none that followed the house of David, butthe tribe of Judah only.   

{12:21} And when Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem, he assembled allthe house of Judah, with the tribe of Benjamin, an hundred andfourscore thousand chosen men, which were warriors, to fight againstthe house of Israel, to bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam the son ofSolomon. 

{12:22} But the word of God came unto Shemaiah the man of God,saying, 

{12:23} Speak unto Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, king of Judah,and unto all the house of Judah and Benjamin, and to the remnant of thepeople, saying, 

{12:24} Thus saith the LORD, Ye shall not go up, norfight against your brethren the children of Israel: return every man tohis house; for this thing is from me. They hearkened therefore to theword of the LORD, and returned to depart, according to the word of theLORD.   

{12:25} Then Jeroboam built Shechem in mount Ephraim, and dwelttherein; and went out from thence, and built Penuel. 

{12:26} AndJeroboam said in his heart, Now shall the kingdom return to the houseof David: 

{12:27} If this people go up to do sacrifice in the house ofthe LORD at Jerusalem, then shall the heart of this people turn againunto their lord, [even] unto Rehoboam king of Judah, and they shallkill me, and go again to Rehoboam king of Judah. 

{12:28} Whereupon theking took counsel, and made two calves [of] gold, and said unto them,It is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem: behold thy gods, OIsrael, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt. 

{12:29} And heset the one in Bethel, and the other put he in Dan. 

{12:30} And thisthing became a sin: for the people went [to worship] before the one,[even] unto Dan. 

{12:31} And he made an house of high places, and madepriests of the lowest of the people, which were not of the sons ofLevi. 

{12:32} And Jeroboam ordained a feast in the eighth month, on thefifteenth day of the month, like unto the feast that [is] in Judah, andhe offered upon the altar. So did he in Bethel, sacrificing unto thecalves that he had made: and he placed in Bethel the priests of thehigh places which he had made. 

{12:33} So he offered upon the altarwhich he had made in Bethel the fifteenth day of the eighth month,[even] in the month which he had devised of his own heart; and ordaineda feast unto the children of Israel: and he offered upon the altar, andburnt incense.   

{13:1} And, behold, there came a man of God out of Judah by the wordof the LORD unto Bethel: and Jeroboam stood by the altar to burnincense. 

{13:2} And he cried against the altar in the word of the LORD,and said, O altar, altar, thus saith the LORD; Behold, a child shall beborn unto the house of David, Josiah by name; and upon thee shall heoffer the priests of the high places that burn incense upon thee, andmen's bones shall be burnt upon thee. 

{13:3} And he gave a sign thesame day, saying, This [is] the sign which the LORD hath spoken;Behold, the altar shall be rent, and the ashes that [are] upon it shallbe poured out. 

{13:4} And it came to pass, when king Jeroboam heard thesaying of the man of God, which had cried against the altar in Bethel,that he put forth his hand from the altar, saying, Lay hold on him. Andhis hand, which he put forth against him, dried up, so that he couldnot pull it in again to him. 

{13:5} The altar also was rent, and theashes poured out from the altar, according to the sign which the man ofGod had given by the word of the LORD. 

{13:6} And the king answered andsaid unto the man of God, Intreat now the face of the LORD thy God, andpray for me, that my hand may be restored me again. And the man of Godbesought the LORD, and the king's hand was restored him again, andbecame as [it was] before. 

{13:7} And the king said unto the man ofGod, Come home with me, and refresh thyself, and I will give thee areward. 

{13:8} And the man of God said unto the king, If thou wilt giveme half thine house, I will not go in with thee, neither will I eatbread nor drink water in this place: 

{13:9} For so was it charged me bythe word of the LORD, saying, Eat no bread, nor drink water, nor turnagain by the same way that thou camest. 

{13:10} So he went another way,and returned not by the way that he came to Bethel.   

{13:11} Now there dwelt an old prophet in Bethel; and his sons cameand told him all the works that the man of God had done that day inBethel: the words which he had spoken unto the king, them they toldalso to their father. 

{13:12} And their father said unto them, What waywent he? For his sons had seen what way the man of God went, which camefrom Judah. 

{13:13} And he said unto his sons, Saddle me the ass. Sothey saddled him the ass: and he rode thereon, 

{13:14} And went afterthe man of God, and found him sitting under an oak: and he said untohim, [Art] thou the man of God that camest from Judah? And he said, I[am. ]

{13:15} Then he said unto him, Come home with me, and eat bread.

{13:16} And he said, I may not return with thee, nor go in with thee:neither will I eat bread nor drink water with thee in this place:

{13:17} For it was said to me by the word of the LORD, Thou shalt eatno bread nor drink water there, nor turn again to go by the way thatthou camest. 

{13:18} He said unto him, I [am] a prophet also as thou[art;] and an angel spake unto me by the word of the LORD, saying,Bring him back with thee into thine house, that he may eat bread anddrink water. [But] he lied unto him. 

{13:19} So he went back with him,and did eat bread in his house, and drank water.   

{13:20} And it came to pass, as they sat at the table, that the wordof the LORD came unto the prophet that brought him back: 

{13:21} And hecried unto the man of God that came from Judah, saying, Thus saith theLORD, Forasmuch as thou hast disobeyed the mouth of the LORD, and hastnot kept the commandment which the LORD thy God commanded thee, 

{13:22}But camest back, and hast eaten bread and drunk water in the place, ofthe which [the LORD] did say to thee, Eat no bread, and drink no water;thy carcase shall not come unto the sepulchre of thy fathers.   

{13:23} And it came to pass, after he had eaten bread, and after hehad drunk, that he saddled for him the ass, [to wit,] for the prophetwhom he had brought back. 

{13:24} And when he was gone, a lion met himby the way, and slew him: and his carcase was cast in the way, and theass stood by it, the lion also stood by the carcase. 

{13:25} And,behold, men passed by, and saw the carcase cast in the way, and thelion standing by the carcase: and they came and told it in the citywhere the old prophet dwelt. 

{13:26} And when the prophet that broughthim back from the way heard [thereof,] he said, It [is] the man of God,who was disobedient unto the word of the LORD: therefore the LORD hathdelivered him unto the lion, which hath torn him, and slain him,according to the word of the LORD, which he spake unto him. 

{13:27} Andhe spake to his sons, saying, Saddle me the ass. And they saddled [him.]

{13:28} And he went and found his carcase cast in the way, and the assand the lion standing by the carcase: the lion had not eaten thecarcase, nor torn the ass. 

{13:29} And the prophet took up the carcaseof the man of God, and laid it upon the ass, and brought it back: andthe old prophet came to the city, to mourn and to bury him. 

{13:30} Andhe laid his carcase in his own grave; and they mourned over him,[saying,] Alas, my brother! 

{13:31} And it came to pass, after he hadburied him, that he spake to his sons, saying, When I am dead, thenbury me in the sepulchre wherein the man of God [is] buried; lay mybones beside his bones: 

{13:32} For the saying which he cried by theword of the LORD against the altar in Bethel, and against all thehouses of the high places which [are] in the cities of Samaria, shallsurely come to pass.   

{13:33} After this thing Jeroboam returned not from his evil way,but made again of the lowest of the people priests of the high places:whosoever would, he consecrated him, and he became [one] of the priestsof the high places. 

{13:34} And this thing became sin unto the house ofJeroboam, even to cut [it] off, and to destroy [it] from off the faceof the earth.   

{14:1} At that time Abijah the son of Jeroboam fell sick. 

{14:2} AndJeroboam said to his wife, Arise, I pray thee, and disguise thyself,that thou be not known to be the wife of Jeroboam; and get thee toShiloh: behold, there [is] Ahijah the prophet, which told me that [Ishould be] king over this people. 

{14:3} And take with thee ten loaves,and cracknels, and a cruse of honey, and go to him: he shall tell theewhat shall become of the child. 

{14:4} And Jeroboam's wife did so, andarose, and went to Shiloh, and came to the house of Ahijah. But Ahijahcould not see; for his eyes were set by reason of his age.   

{14:5} And the LORD said unto Ahijah, Behold, the wife of Jeroboamcometh to ask a thing of thee for her son; for he is sick: thus andthus shalt thou say unto her: for it shall be, when she cometh in, thatshe shall feign herself [to be] another [woman. ]

{14:6} And it was[so,] when Ahijah heard the sound of her feet as she came in at thedoor, that he said, Come in, thou wife of Jeroboam; why feignest thouthyself [to be] another? for I [am] sent to thee [with] heavy [tidings.]

{14:7} Go, tell Jeroboam, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Forasmuchas I exalted thee from among the people, and made thee prince over mypeople Israel, 

{14:8} And rent the kingdom away from the house ofDavid, and gave it thee: and yet thou hast not been as my servantDavid, who kept my commandments, and who followed me with all hisheart, to do [that] only [which was] right in mine eyes; 

{14:9} Buthast done evil above all that were before thee: for thou hast gone andmade thee other gods, and molten images, to provoke me to anger, andhast cast me behind thy back: 

{14:10} Therefore, behold, I will bringevil upon the house of Jeroboam, and will cut off from Jeroboam himthat pisseth against the wall, [and] him that is shut up and left inIsrael, and will take away the remnant of the house of Jeroboam, as aman taketh away dung, till it be all gone. 

{14:11} Him that dieth ofJeroboam in the city shall the dogs eat; and him that dieth in thefield shall the fowls of the air eat: for the LORD hath spoken it.

{14:12} Arise thou therefore, get thee to thine own house: [and] whenthy feet enter into the city, the child shall die. 

{14:13} And allIsrael shall mourn for him, and bury him: for he only of Jeroboam shallcome to the grave, because in him there is found [some] good thingtoward the LORD God of Israel in the house of Jeroboam. 

{14:14}Moreover the LORD shall raise him up a king over Israel, who shall cutoff the house of Jeroboam that day: but what? even now. 

{14:15} For theLORD shall smite Israel, as a reed is shaken in the water, and he shallroot up Israel out of this good land, which he gave to their fathers,and shall scatter them beyond the river, because they have made theirgroves, provoking the LORD to anger. 

{14:16} And he shall give Israelup because of the sins of Jeroboam, who did sin, and who made Israel tosin.   

{14:17} And Jeroboam's wife arose, and departed, and came to Tirzah:[and] when she came to the threshold of the door, the child died;

{14:18} And they buried him; and all Israel mourned for him, accordingto the word of the LORD, which he spake by the hand of his servantAhijah the prophet. 

{14:19} And the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, howhe warred, and how he reigned, behold, they [are] written in the bookof the chronicles of the kings of Israel. 

{14:20} And the days whichJeroboam reigned [were] two and twenty years: and he slept with hisfathers, and Nadab his son reigned in his stead.   

{14:21} And Rehoboam the son of Solomon reigned in Judah. Rehoboam[was] forty and one years old when he began to reign, and he reignedseventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which the LORD did choose out ofall the tribes of Israel, to put his name there. And his mother's name[was] Naamah an Ammonitess. 

{14:22} And Judah did evil in the sight ofthe LORD, and they provoked him to jealousy with their sins which theyhad committed, above all that their fathers had done. 

{14:23} For theyalso built them high places, and images, and groves, on every highhill, and under every green tree. 

{14:24} And there were also sodomitesin the land: [and] they did according to all the abominations of thenations which the LORD cast out before the children of Israel.   

{14:25} And it came to pass in the fifth year of king Rehoboam,[that] Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem: 

{14:26} And hetook away the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures ofthe king's house; he even took away all: and he took away all theshields of gold which Solomon had made. 

{14:27} And king Rehoboam madein their stead brasen shields, and committed [them] unto the hands ofthe chief of the guard, which kept the door of the king's house.

{14:28} And it was [so,] when the king went into the house of the LORD,that the guard bare them, and brought them back into the guard chamber.   

{14:29} Now the rest of the acts of Rehoboam, and all that he did,[are] they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings ofJudah? 

{14:30} And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all[their] days. 

{14:31} And Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and wasburied with his fathers in the city of David. And his mother's name[was] Naamah an Ammonitess. And Abijam his son reigned in his stead.   

{15:1} Now in the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam the son of Nebatreigned Abijam over Judah. 

{15:2} Three years reigned he in Jerusalem.And his mother's name [was] Maachah, the daughter of Abishalom. 

{15:3}And he walked in all the sins of his father, which he had done beforehim: and his heart was not perfect with the LORD his God, as the heartof David his father. 

{15:4} Nevertheless for David's sake did the LORDhis God give him a lamp in Jerusalem, to set up his son after him, andto establish Jerusalem: 

{15:5} Because David did [that which was] rightin the eyes of the LORD, and turned not aside from any [thing] that hecommanded him all the days of his life, save only in the matter ofUriah the Hittite. 

{15:6} And there was war between Rehoboam andJeroboam all the days of his life. 

{15:7} Now the rest of the acts ofAbijam, and all that he did, [are] they not written in the book of thechronicles of the kings of Judah? And there was war between Abijam andJeroboam. 

{15:8} And Abijam slept with his fathers; and they buried himin the city of David: and Asa his son reigned in his stead.   

{15:9} And in the twentieth year of Jeroboam king of Israel reignedAsa over Judah. 

{15:10} And forty and one years reigned he inJerusalem. And his mother's name [was] Maachah, the daughter ofAbishalom. 

{15:11} And Asa did [that which was] right in the eyes ofthe LORD, as [did] David his father. 

{15:12} And he took away thesodomites out of the land, and removed all the idols that his fathershad made. 

{15:13} And also Maachah his mother, even her he removed from[being] queen, because she had made an idol in a grove; and Asadestroyed her idol, and burnt [it] by the brook Kidron. 

{15:14} But thehigh places were not removed: nevertheless Asa's heart was perfect withthe LORD all his days. 

{15:15} And he brought in the things which hisfather had dedicated, and the things which himself had dedicated, intothe house of the LORD, silver, and gold, and vessels.   

{15:16} And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel alltheir days. 

{15:17} And Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah,and built Ramah, that he might not suffer any to go out or come in toAsa king of Judah. 

{15:18} Then Asa took all the silver and the gold[that were] left in the treasures of the house of the LORD, and thetreasures of the king's house, and delivered them into the hand of hisservants: and king Asa sent them to Ben-hadad, the son of Tabrimon, theson of Hezion, king of Syria, that dwelt at Damascus, saying, 

{15:19}[There is] a league between me and thee, [and] between my father andthy father: behold, I have sent unto thee a present of silver and gold;come and break thy league with Baasha king of Israel, that he maydepart from me. 

{15:20} So Ben- hadad hearkened unto king Asa, and sentthe captains of the hosts which he had against the cities of Israel,and smote Ijon, and Dan, and Abel-beth-maachah, and all Cinneroth, withall the land of Naphtali. 

{15:21} And it came to pass, when Baashaheard [thereof,] that he left off building of Ramah, and dwelt inTirzah. 

{15:22} Then king Asa made a proclamation throughout all Judah;none [was] exempted: and they took away the stones of Ramah, and thetimber thereof, wherewith Baasha had builded; and king Asa built withthem Geba of Benjamin, and Mizpah. 

{15:23} The rest of all the acts ofAsa, and all his might, and all that he did, and the cities which hebuilt, [are] they not written in the book of the chronicles of thekings of Judah? Nevertheless in the time of his old age he was diseasedin his feet. 

{15:24} And Asa slept with his fathers, and was buriedwith his fathers in the city of David his father: and Jehoshaphat hisson reigned in his stead.   

{15:25} And Nadab the son of Jeroboam began to reign over Israel inthe second year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned over Israel twoyears. 

{15:26} And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked inthe way of his father, and in his sin wherewith he made Israel to sin.   

{15:27} And Baasha the son of Ahijah, of the house of Issachar,conspired against him; and Baasha smote him at Gibbethon, which[belonged] to the Philistines; for Nadab and all Israel laid siege toGibbethon. 

{15:28} Even in the third year of Asa king of Judah didBaasha slay him, and reigned in his stead. 

{15:29} And it came to pass,when he reigned, [that] he smote all the house of Jeroboam; he left notto Jeroboam any that breathed, until he had destroyed him, accordingunto the saying of the LORD, which he spake by his servant Ahijah theShilonite: 

{15:30} Because of the sins of Jeroboam which he sinned, andwhich he made Israel sin, by his provocation wherewith he provoked theLORD God of Israel to anger.   

{15:31} Now the rest of the acts of Nadab, and all that he did,[are] they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings ofIsrael? 

{15:32} And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israelall their days. 

{15:33} In the third year of Asa king of Judah beganBaasha the son of Ahijah to reign over all Israel in Tirzah, twenty andfour years. 

{15:34} And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, andwalked in the way of Jeroboam, and in his sin wherewith he made Israelto sin.   

{16:1} Then the word of the LORD came to Jehu the son of Hananiagainst Baasha, saying, 

{16:2} Forasmuch as I exalted thee out of thedust, and made thee prince over my people Israel; and thou hast walkedin the way of Jeroboam, and hast made my people Israel to sin, toprovoke me to anger with their sins; 

{16:3} Behold, I will take awaythe posterity of Baasha, and the posterity of his house; and will makethy house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat. 

{16:4} Him thatdieth of Baasha in the city shall the dogs eat; and him that dieth ofhis in the fields shall the fowls of the air eat. 

{16:5} Now the restof the acts of Baasha, and what he did, and his might, [are] they notwritten in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? 

{16:6} SoBaasha slept with his fathers, and was buried in Tirzah: and Elah hisson reigned in his stead. 

{16:7} And also by the hand of the prophetJehu the son of Hanani came the word of the LORD against Baasha, andagainst his house, even for all the evil that he did in the sight ofthe LORD, in provoking him to anger with the work of his hands, inbeing like the house of Jeroboam; and because he killed him.   

{16:8} In the twenty and sixth year of Asa king of Judah began Elahthe son of Baasha to reign over Israel in Tirzah, two years. 

{16:9} Andhis servant Zimri, captain of half [his] chariots, conspired againsthim, as he was in Tirzah, drinking himself drunk in the house of Arzasteward of [his] house in Tirzah. 

{16:10} And Zimri went in and smotehim, and killed him, in the twenty and seventh year of Asa king ofJudah, and reigned in his stead.   

{16:11} And it came to pass, when he began to reign, as soon as hesat on his throne, [that] he slew all the house of Baasha: he left himnot one that pisseth against a wall, neither of his kinsfolks, nor ofhis friends. 

{16:12} Thus did Zimri destroy all the house of Baasha,according to the word of the LORD, which he spake against Baasha byJehu the prophet, 

{16:13} For all the sins of Baasha, and the sins ofElah his son, by which they sinned, and by which they made Israel tosin, in provoking the LORD God of Israel to anger with their vanities.

{16:14} Now the rest of the acts of Elah, and all that he did, [are]they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?   

{16:15} In the twenty and seventh year of Asa king of Judah didZimri reign seven days in Tirzah. And the people [were] encampedagainst Gibbethon, which [belonged] to the Philistines. 

{16:16} And thepeople [that were] encamped heard say, Zimri hath conspired, and hathalso slain the king: wherefore all Israel made Omri, the captain of thehost, king over Israel that day in the camp. 

{16:17} And Omri went upfrom Gibbethon, and all Israel with him, and they besieged Tirzah.

{16:18} And it came to pass, when Zimri saw that the city was taken,that he went into the palace of the king's house, and burnt the king'shouse over him with fire, and died, 

{16:19} For his sins which hesinned in doing evil in the sight of the LORD, in walking in the way ofJeroboam, and in his sin which he did, to make Israel to sin. 

{16:20}Now the rest of the acts of Zimri, and his treason that he wrought,[are] they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings ofIsrael?   

{16:21} Then were the people of Israel divided into two parts: halfof the people followed Tibni the son of Ginath, to make him king; andhalf followed Omri. 

{16:22} But the people that followed Omri prevailedagainst the people that followed Tibni the son of Ginath: so Tibnidied, and Omri reigned.   

{16:23} In the thirty and first year of Asa king of Judah began Omrito reign over Israel, twelve years: six years reigned he in Tirzah.

{16:24} And he bought the hill Samaria of Shemer for two talents ofsilver, and built on the hill, and called the name of the city which hebuilt, after the name of Shemer, owner of the hill, Samaria.   

{16:25} But Omri wrought evil in the eyes of the LORD, and did worsethan all that [were] before him. 

{16:26} For he walked in all the wayof Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and in his sin wherewith he made Israelto sin, to provoke the LORD God of Israel to anger with their vanities.

{16:27} Now the rest of the acts of Omri which he did, and his mightthat he shewed, [are] they not written in the book of the chronicles ofthe kings of Israel? 

{16:28} So Omri slept with his fathers, and wasburied in Samaria: and Ahab his son reigned in his stead.   

{16:29} And in the thirty and eighth year of Asa king of Judah beganAhab the son of Omri to reign over Israel: and Ahab the son of Omrireigned over Israel in Samaria twenty and two years. 

{16:30} And Ahabthe son of Omri did evil in the sight of the LORD above all that [were]before him. 

{16:31} And it came to pass, as if it had been a lightthing for him to walk in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, that hetook to wife Jezebel the daughter of Ethbaal king of the Zidonians, andwent and served Baal, and worshipped him. 

{16:32} And he reared up analtar for Baal in the house of Baal, which he had built in Samaria.

{16:33} And Ahab made a grove; and Ahab did more to provoke the LORDGod of Israel to anger than all the kings of Israel that were beforehim.   

{16:34} In his days did Hiel the Bethelite build Jericho: he laidthe foundation thereof in Abiram his firstborn, and set up the gatesthereof in his youngest [son] Segub, according to the word of the LORD,which he spake by Joshua the son of Nun.   

{17:1} And Elijah the Tishbite, [who was] of the inhabitants ofGilead, said unto Ahab, [As] the LORD God of Israel liveth, before whomI stand, there shall not be dew nor rain these years, but according tomy word. 

{17:2} And the word of the LORD came unto him, saying, 

{17:3}Get thee hence, and turn thee eastward, and hide thyself by the brookCherith, that [is] before Jordan. 

{17:4} And it shall be, [that] thoushalt drink of the brook; and I have commanded the ravens to feed theethere. 

{17:5} So he went and did according unto the word of the LORD:for he went and dwelt by the brook Cherith, that [is] before Jordan.

{17:6} And the ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning, andbread and flesh in the evening; and he drank of the brook. 

{17:7} Andit came to pass after a while, that the brook dried up, because therehad been no rain in the land.   

{17:8} And the word of the LORD came unto him, saying, 

{17:9} Arise,get thee to Zarephath, which [belongeth] to Zidon, and dwell there:behold, I have commanded a widow woman there to sustain thee. 

{17:10}So he arose and went to Zarephath. And when he came to the gate of thecity, behold, the widow woman [was] there gathering of sticks: and hecalled to her, and said, Fetch me, I pray thee, a little water in avessel, that I may drink. 

{17:11} And as she was going to fetch [it,]he called to her, and said, Bring me, I pray thee, a morsel of bread inthine hand. 

{17:12} And she said, [As] the LORD thy God liveth, I havenot a cake, but an handful of meal in a barrel, and a little oil in acruse: and, behold, I [am] gathering two sticks, that I may go in anddress it for me and my son, that we may eat it, and die. 

{17:13} AndElijah said unto her, Fear not; go [and] do as thou hast said: but makeme thereof a little cake first, and bring [it] unto me, and after makefor thee and for thy son. 

{17:14} For thus saith the LORD God ofIsrael, The barrel of meal shall not waste, neither shall the cruse ofoil fail, until the day [that] the LORD sendeth rain upon the earth.

{17:15} And she went and did according to the saying of Elijah: andshe, and he, and her house, did eat [many] days. 

{17:16} [And] thebarrel of meal wasted not, neither did the cruse of oil fail, accordingto the word of the LORD, which he spake by Elijah.   

{17:17} And it came to pass after these things, [that] the son ofthe woman, the mistress of the house, fell sick; and his sickness wasso sore, that there was no breath left in him. 

{17:18} And she saidunto Elijah, What have I to do with thee, O thou man of God? art thoucome unto me to call my sin to remembrance, and to slay my son? 

{17:19}And he said unto her, Give me thy son. And he took him out of herbosom, and carried him up into a loft, where he abode, and laid himupon his own bed. 

{17:20} And he cried unto the LORD, and said, O LORDmy God, hast thou also brought evil upon the widow with whom I sojourn,by slaying her son? 

{17:21} And he stretched himself upon the childthree times, and cried unto the LORD, and said, O LORD my God, I praythee, let this child's soul come into him again. 

{17:22} And the LORDheard the voice of Elijah; and the soul of the child came into himagain, and he revived. 

{17:23} And Elijah took the child, and broughthim down out of the chamber into the house, and delivered him unto hismother: and Elijah said, See, thy son liveth.   

{17:24} And the woman said to Elijah, Now by this I know that thou[art] a man of God, [and] that the word of the LORD in thy mouth [is]truth.   

{18:1} And it came to pass [after] many days, that the word of theLORD came to Elijah in the third year, saying, Go, shew thyself untoAhab; and I will send rain upon the earth. 

{18:2} And Elijah went toshew himself unto Ahab. And [there was] a sore famine in Samaria.

{18:3} And Ahab called Obadiah, which [was] the governor of [his]house. (Now Obadiah feared the LORD greatly: 

{18:4} For it was [so,]when Jezebel cut off the prophets of the LORD, that Obadiah took anhundred prophets, and hid them by fifty in a cave, and fed them withbread and water.) 

{18:5} And Ahab said unto Obadiah, Go into the land,unto all fountains of water, and unto all brooks: peradventure we mayfind grass to save the horses and mules alive, that we lose not all thebeasts. 

{18:6} So they divided the land between them to pass throughoutit: Ahab went one way by himself, and Obadiah went another way byhimself.   

{18:7} And as Obadiah was in the way, behold, Elijah met him: and heknew him, and fell on his face, and said, [Art] thou that my lordElijah? 

{18:8} And he answered him, I [am:] go, tell thy lord, Behold,Elijah [is here. ]

{18:9} And he said, What have I sinned, that thouwouldest deliver thy servant into the hand of Ahab, to slay me? 

{18:10}[As] the LORD thy God liveth, there is no nation or kingdom, whither mylord hath not sent to seek thee: and when they said, [He is] not[there;] he took an oath of the kingdom and nation, that they foundthee not. 

{18:11} And now thou sayest, Go, tell thy lord, Behold,Elijah [is here. ]

{18:12} And it shall come to pass, [as soon as] I amgone from thee, that the Spirit of the LORD shall carry thee whither Iknow not; and so when I come and tell Ahab, and he cannot find thee, heshall slay me: but I thy servant fear the LORD from my youth. 

{18:13}Was it not told my lord what I did when Jezebel slew the prophets ofthe LORD, how I hid an hundred men of the LORD'S prophets by fifty in acave, and fed them with bread and water? 

{18:14} And now thou sayest,Go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah [is here:] and he shall slay me.

{18:15} And Elijah said, [As] the LORD of hosts liveth, before whom Istand, I will surely shew myself unto him to day. 

{18:16} So Obadiahwent to meet Ahab, and told him: and Ahab went to meet Elijah.   

{18:17} And it came to pass, when Ahab saw Elijah, that Ahab saidunto him, [Art] thou he that troubleth Israel? 

{18:18} And he answered,I have not troubled Israel; but thou, and thy father's house, in thatye have forsaken the commandments of the LORD, and thou hast followedBaalim. 

{18:19} Now therefore send, [and] gather to me all Israel untomount Carmel, and the prophets of Baal four hundred and fifty, and theprophets of the groves four hundred, which eat at Jezebel's table.

{18:20} So Ahab sent unto all the children of Israel, and gathered theprophets together unto mount Carmel. 

{18:21} And Elijah came unto allthe people, and said, How long halt ye between two opinions? if theLORD [be] God, follow him: but if Baal, [then] follow him. And thepeople answered him not a word. 

{18:22} Then said Elijah unto thepeople, I, [even] I only, remain a prophet of the LORD; but Baal'sprophets [are] four hundred and fifty men. 

{18:23} Let them thereforegive us two bullocks; and let them choose one bullock for themselves,and cut it in pieces, and lay [it] on wood, and put no fire [under:]and I will dress the other bullock, and lay [it] on wood, and put nofire [under: ]

{18:24} And call ye on the name of your gods, and I willcall on the name of the LORD: and the God that answereth by fire, lethim be God. And all the people answered and said, It is well spoken.

{18:25} And Elijah said unto the prophets of Baal, Choose you onebullock for yourselves, and dress [it] first; for ye [are] many; andcall on the name of your gods, but put no fire [under. ]

{18:26} Andthey took the bullock which was given them, and they dressed [it,] andcalled on the name of Baal from morning even until noon, saying, OBaal, hear us. But [there was] no voice, nor any that answered. Andthey leaped upon the altar which was made. 

{18:27} And it came to passat noon, that Elijah mocked them, and said, Cry aloud: for he [is] agod; either he is talking, or he is pursuing, or he is in a journey,[or] peradventure he sleepeth, and must be awaked. 

{18:28} And theycried aloud, and cut themselves after their manner with knives andlancets, till the blood gushed out upon them. 

{18:29} And it came topass, when midday was past, and they prophesied until the [time] of theoffering of the [evening] sacrifice, that [there was] neither voice,nor any to answer, nor any that regarded. 

{18:30} And Elijah said untoall the people, Come near unto me. And all the people came near untohim. And he repaired the altar of the LORD [that was] broken down.

{18:31} And Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of thetribes of the sons of Jacob, unto whom the word of the LORD came,saying, Israel shall be thy name: 

{18:32} And with the stones he builtan altar in the name of the LORD: and he made a trench about the altar,as great as would contain two measures of seed. 

{18:33} And he put thewood in order, and cut the bullock in pieces, and laid [him] on thewood, and said, Fill four barrels with water, and pour [it] on theburnt sacrifice, and on the wood. 

{18:34} And he said, Do [it] thesecond time. And they did [it] the second time. And he said, Do [it]the third time. And they did [it] the third time. 

{18:35} And the waterran round about the altar; and he filled the trench also with water.

{18:36} And it came to pass at [the time of] the offering of the[evening] sacrifice, that Elijah the prophet came near, and said, LORDGod of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, let it be known this day thatthou art God in Israel, and [that] I [am] thy servant, and [that] Ihave done all these things at thy word. 

{18:37} Hear me, O LORD, hearme, that this people may know that thou [art] the LORD God, and [that]thou hast turned their heart back again. 

{18:38} Then the fire of theLORD fell, and consumed the burnt sacrifice, and the wood, and thestones, and the dust, and licked up the water that [was] in the trench.

{18:39} And when all the people saw [it,] they fell on their faces: andthey said, The LORD, he [is] the God; the LORD, he [is] the God.

{18:40} And Elijah said unto them, Take the prophets of Baal; let notone of them escape. And they took them: and Elijah brought them down tothe brook Kishon, and slew them there.   

{18:41} And Elijah said unto Ahab, Get thee up, eat and drink; for[there is] a sound of abundance of rain. 

{18:42} So Ahab went up to eatand to drink. And Elijah went up to the top of Carmel; and he casthimself down upon the earth, and put his face between his knees,

{18:43} And said to his servant, Go up now, look toward the sea. And hewent up, and looked, and said, [There is] nothing. And he said, Goagain seven times. 

{18:44} And it came to pass at the seventh time,that he said, Behold, there ariseth a little cloud out of the sea, likea man's hand. And he said, Go up, say unto Ahab, Prepare [thy chariot,]and get thee down, that the rain stop thee not. 

{18:45} And it came topass in the mean while, that the heaven was black with clouds and wind,and there was a great rain. And Ahab rode, and went to Jezreel. 

{18:46}And the hand of the LORD was on Elijah; and he girded up his loins, andran before Ahab to the entrance of Jezreel.   

{19:1} And Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done, and withalhow he had slain all the prophets with the sword. 

{19:2} Then Jezebelsent a messenger unto Elijah, saying, So let the gods do [to me,] andmore also, if I make not thy life as the life of one of them by tomorrow about this time. 

{19:3} And when he saw [that,] he arose, andwent for his life, and came to Beer-sheba, which [belongeth] to Judah,and left his servant there.   

{19:4} But he himself went a day's journey into the wilderness, andcame and sat down under a juniper tree: and he requested for himselfthat he might die; and said, It is enough; now, O LORD, take away mylife; for I [am] not better than my fathers. 

{19:5} And as he lay andslept under a juniper tree, behold, then an angel touched him, and saidunto him, Arise [and] eat. 

{19:6} And he looked, and, behold, [therewas] a cake baken on the coals, and a cruse of water at his head. Andhe did eat and drink, and laid him down again. 

{19:7} And the angel ofthe LORD came again the second time, and touched him, and said, Arise[and] eat; because the journey [is] too great for thee. 

{19:8} And hearose, and did eat and drink, and went in the strength of that meatforty days and forty nights unto Horeb the mount of God.   

{19:9} And he came thither unto a cave, and lodged there; and,behold, the word of the LORD [came] to him, and he said unto him, Whatdoest thou here, Elijah? 

{19:10} And he said, I have been very jealousfor the LORD God of hosts: for the children of Israel have forsaken thycovenant, thrown down thine altars, and slain thy prophets with thesword; and I, [even] I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take itaway. 

{19:11} And he said, Go forth, and stand upon the mount beforethe LORD. And, behold, the LORD passed by, and a great and strong windrent the mountains, and brake in pieces the rocks before the LORD;[but] the LORD [was] not in the wind: and after the wind an earthquake;[but] the LORD [was] not in the earthquake: 

{19:12} And after theearthquake a fire; [but] the LORD [was] not in the fire: and after thefire a still small voice. 

{19:13} And it was [so,] when Elijah heard[it,] that he wrapped his face in his mantle, and went out, and stoodin the entering in of the cave. And, behold, [there came] a voice untohim, and said, What doest thou here, Elijah? 

{19:14} And he said, Ihave been very jealous for the LORD God of hosts: because the childrenof Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down thine altars, andslain thy prophets with the sword; and I, [even] I only, am left; andthey seek my life, to take it away. 

{19:15} And the LORD said unto him,Go, return on thy way to the wilderness of Damascus: and when thoucomest, anoint Hazael [to be] king over Syria: 

{19:16} And Jehu the sonof Nimshi shalt thou anoint [to be] king over Israel: and Elisha theson of Shaphat of Abel-meholah shalt thou anoint [to be] prophet in thyroom. 

{19:17} And it shall come to pass, [that] him that escapeth thesword of Hazael shall Jehu slay: and him that escapeth from the swordof Jehu shall Elisha slay. 

{19:18} Yet I have left [me] seven thousandin Israel, all the knees which have not bowed unto Baal, and everymouth which hath not kissed him.   

{19:19} So he departed thence, and found Elisha the son of Shaphat,who [was] plowing [with] twelve yoke [of oxen] before him, and he withthe twelfth: and Elijah passed by him, and cast his mantle upon him.

{19:20} And he left the oxen, and ran after Elijah, and said, Let me, Ipray thee, kiss my father and my mother, and [then] I will follow thee.And he said unto him, Go back again: for what have I done to thee?

{19:21} And he returned back from him, and took a yoke of oxen, andslew them, and boiled their flesh with the instruments of the oxen, andgave unto the people, and they did eat. Then he arose, and went afterElijah, and ministered unto him.   

{20:1} And Ben-hadad the king of Syria gathered all his hosttogether: and [there were] thirty and two kings with him, and horses,and chariots: and he went up and besieged Samaria, and warred againstit. 

{20:2} And he sent messengers to Ahab king of Israel into the city,and said unto him, Thus saith Ben-hadad, 

{20:3} Thy silver and thy gold[is] mine; thy wives also and thy children, [even] the goodliest, [are]mine. 

{20:4} And the king of Israel answered and said, My lord, O king,according to thy saying, I [am] thine, and all that I have. 

{20:5} Andthe messengers came again, and said, Thus speaketh Ben-hadad, saying,Although I have sent unto thee, saying, Thou shalt deliver me thysilver, and thy gold, and thy wives, and thy children; 

{20:6} Yet Iwill send my servants unto thee to morrow about this time, and theyshall search thine house, and the houses of thy servants; and it shallbe, [that] whatsoever is pleasant in thine eyes, they shall put [it] intheir hand, and take [it] away. 

{20:7} Then the king of Israel calledall the elders of the land, and said, Mark, I pray you, and see howthis [man] seeketh mischief: for he sent unto me for my wives, and formy children, and for my silver, and for my gold; and I denied him not.

{20:8} And all the elders and all the people said unto him, Hearken not[unto him,] nor consent. 

{20:9} Wherefore he said unto the messengersof Ben-hadad, Tell my lord the king, All that thou didst send for tothy servant at the first I will do: but this thing I may not do. Andthe messengers departed, and brought him word again. 

{20:10} AndBen-hadad sent unto him, and said, The gods do so unto me, and morealso, if the dust of Samaria shall suffice for handfuls for all thepeople that follow me. 

{20:11} And the king of Israel answered andsaid, Tell [him,] Let not him that girdeth on [his harness] boasthimself as he that putteth it off. 

{20:12} And it came to pass, when[Ben-hadad] heard this message, as he [was] drinking, he and the kingsin the pavilions,that he said unto his servants, Set [yourselves inarray.] And they set [themselves in array] against the city.   

{20:13} And, behold, there came a prophet unto Ahab king of Israel,saying, Thus saith the LORD, Hast thou seen all this great multitude?behold, I will deliver it into thine hand this day; and thou shalt knowthat I [am] the LORD. 

{20:14} And Ahab said, By whom? And he said, Thussaith the LORD, [Even] by the young men of the princes of theprovinces. Then he said, Who shall order the battle? And he answered,Thou. 

{20:15} Then he numbered the young men of the princes of theprovinces, and they were two hundred and thirty two: and after them henumbered all the people, [even] all the children of Israel, [being]seven thousand. 

{20:16} And they went out at noon. But Ben-hadad [was]drinking himself drunk in the pavilions, he and the kings, the thirtyand two kings that helped him. 

{20:17} And the young men of the princesof the provinces went out first; and Ben-hadad sent out, and they toldhim, saying, There are men come out of Samaria. 

{20:18} And he said,Whether they be come out for peace, take them alive; or whether they become out for war, take them alive. 

{20:19} So these young men of theprinces of the provinces came out of the city, and the army whichfollowed them. 

{20:20} And they slew every one his man: and the Syriansfled; and Israel pursued them: and Ben-hadad the king of Syria escapedon an horse with the horsemen. 

{20:21} And the king of Israel went out,and smote the horses and chariots, and slew the Syrians with a greatslaughter.   

{20:22} And the prophet came to the king of Israel, and said untohim, Go, strengthen thyself, and mark, and see what thou doest: for atthe return of the year the king of Syria will come up against thee.

{20:23} And the servants of the king of Syria said unto him, Their gods[are] gods of the hills; therefore they were stronger than we; but letus fight against them in the plain, and surely we shall be strongerthan they. 

{20:24} And do this thing, Take the kings away, every manout of his place, and put captains in their rooms: 

{20:25} And numberthee an army, like the army that thou hast lost, horse for horse, andchariot for chariot: and we will fight against them in the plain, [and]surely we shall be stronger than they. And he hearkened unto theirvoice, and did so. 

{20:26} And it came to pass at the return of theyear, that Ben-hadad numbered the Syrians, and went up to Aphek, tofight against Israel. 

{20:27} And the children of Israel were numbered,and were all present, and went against them: and the children of Israelpitched before them like two little flocks of kids; but the Syriansfilled the country. 

{20:28} And there came a man of God, and spake untothe king of Israel, and said, Thus saith the LORD, Because the Syrianshave said, The LORD [is] God of the hills, but he [is] not God of thevalleys, therefore will I deliver all this great multitude into thinehand, and ye shall know that I [am] the LORD. 

{20:29} And they pitchedone over against the other seven days. And so it was, that in theseventh day the battle was joined: and the children of Israel slew ofthe Syrians an hundred thousand footmen in one day. 

{20:30} But therest fled to Aphek, into the city; and [there] a wall fell upon twentyand seven thousand of the men [that were] left. And Ben-hadad fled, andcame into the city, into an inner chamber.   

{20:31} And his servants said unto him, Behold now, we have heardthat the kings of the house of Israel [are] merciful kings: let us, Ipray thee, put sackcloth on our loins, and ropes upon our heads, and goout to the king of Israel: peradventure he will save thy life. 

{20:32}So they girded sackcloth on their loins, and [put] ropes on theirheads, and came to the king of Israel, and said, Thy servant Ben-hadadsaith, I pray thee, let me live. And he said, [Is] he yet alive? he ismy brother. 

{20:33} Now the men did diligently observe whether [anything would come] from him, and did hastily catch [it:] and they said,Thy brother Ben-hadad. Then he said, Go ye, bring him. Then Ben-hadadcame forth to him; and he caused him to come up into the chariot.

{20:34} And [Ben-hadad] said unto him, The cities, which my father tookfrom thy father, I will restore; and thou shalt make streets for theein Damascus, as my father made in Samaria. Then [said Ahab,] I willsend thee away with this covenant. So he made a covenant with him, andsent him away.   

{20:35} And a certain man of the sons of the prophets said unto hisneighbour in the word of the LORD, Smite me, I pray thee. And the manrefused to smite him. 

{20:36} Then said he unto him, Because thou hastnot obeyed the voice of the LORD, behold, as soon as thou art departedfrom me, a lion shall slay thee. And as soon as he was departed fromhim, a lion found him, and slew him. 

{20:37} Then he found another man,and said, Smite me, I pray thee. And the man smote him, so that insmiting he wounded [him. ]

{20:38} So the prophet departed, and waitedfor the king by the way, and disguised himself with ashes upon hisface. 

{20:39} And as the king passed by, he cried unto the king: and hesaid, Thy servant went out into the midst of the battle; and, behold, aman turned aside, and brought a man unto me, and said, Keep this man:if by any means he be missing, then shall thy life be for his life, orelse thou shalt pay a talent of silver. 

{20:40} And as thy servant wasbusy here and there, he was gone. And the king of Israel said unto him,So [shall] thy judgment [be;] thyself hast decided [it. ]

{20:41} And hehasted, and took the ashes away from his face; and the king of Israeldiscerned him that he [was] of the prophets. 

{20:42} And he said untohim, Thus saith the LORD, Because thou hast let go out of [thy] hand aman whom I appointed to utter destruction, therefore thy life shall gofor his life, and thy people for his people. 

{20:43} And the king ofIsrael went to his house heavy and displeased, and came to Samaria.   

{21:1} And it came to pass after these things, [that] Naboth theJezreelite had a vineyard, which [was] in Jezreel, hard by the palaceof Ahab king of Samaria. 

{21:2} And Ahab spake unto Naboth, saying,Give me thy vineyard, that I may have it for a garden of herbs, becauseit [is] near unto my house: and I will give thee for it a bettervineyard than it; [or,] if it seem good to thee, I will give thee theworth of it in money. 

{21:3} And Naboth said to Ahab, The LORD forbidit me, that I should give the inheritance of my fathers unto thee.

{21:4} And Ahab came into his house heavy and displeased because of theword which Naboth the Jezreelite had spoken to him: for he had said, Iwill not give thee the inheritance of my fathers. And he laid him downupon his bed, and turned away his face, and would eat no bread.   

{21:5} But Jezebel his wife came to him, and said unto him, Why isthy spirit so sad, that thou eatest no bread? 

{21:6} And he said untoher, Because I spake unto Naboth the Jezreelite, and said unto him,Give me thy vineyard for money; or else, if it please thee, I will givethee [another] vineyard for it: and he answered, I will not give theemy vineyard. 

{21:7} And Jezebel his wife said unto him, Dost thou nowgovern the kingdom of Israel? arise, [and] eat bread, and let thineheart be merry: I will give thee the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite.

{21:8} So she wrote letters in Ahab's name, and sealed [them] with hisseal, and sent the letters unto the elders and to the nobles that[were] in his city, dwelling with Naboth. 

{21:9} And she wrote in theletters, saying, Proclaim a fast, and set Naboth on high among thepeople: 

{21:10} And set two men, sons of Belial, before him, to bearwitness against him, saying, Thou didst blaspheme God and the king. And[then] carry him out, and stone him, that he may die. 

{21:11} And themen of his city, [even] the elders and the nobles who were theinhabitants in his city, did as Jezebel had sent unto them, [and] as it[was] written in the letters which she had sent unto them. 

{21:12} Theyproclaimed a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people. 

{21:13} Andthere came in two men, children of Belial, and sat before him: and themen of Belial witnessed against him, [even] against Naboth, in thepresence of the people, saying, Naboth did blaspheme God and the king.Then they carried him forth out of the city, and stoned him withstones, that he died. 

{21:14} Then they sent to Jezebel, saying, Nabothis stoned, and is dead.   

{21:15} And it came to pass, when Jezebel heard that Naboth wasstoned, and was dead, that Jezebel said to Ahab, Arise, take possessionof the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, which he refused to give theefor money: for Naboth is not alive, but dead. 

{21:16} And it came topass, when Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, that Ahab rose up to godown to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, to take possession of it.   

{21:17} And the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite,saying, 

{21:18} Arise, go down to meet Ahab king of Israel, which [is]in Samaria: behold, [he is] in the vineyard of Naboth, whither he isgone down to possess it. 

{21:19} And thou shalt speak unto him, saying,Thus saith the LORD, Hast thou killed, and also taken possession? Andthou shalt speak unto him, saying, Thus saith the LORD, In the placewhere dogs licked the blood of Naboth shall dogs lick thy blood, eventhine. 

{21:20} And Ahab said to Elijah, Hast thou found me, O mineenemy? And he answered, I have found [thee:] because thou hast soldthyself to work evil in the sight of the LORD. 

{21:21} Behold, I willbring evil upon thee, and will take away thy posterity, and will cutoff from Ahab him that pisseth against the wall, and him that is shutup and left in Israel, 

{21:22} And will make thine house like the houseof Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son ofAhijah, for the provocation wherewith thou hast provoked [me] to anger,and made Israel to sin. 

{21:23} And of Jezebel also spake the LORD,saying, The dogs shall eat Jezebel by the wall of Jezreel. 

{21:24} Himthat dieth of Ahab in the city the dogs shall eat; and him that diethin the field shall the fowls of the air eat.   

{21:25} But there was none like unto Ahab, which did sell himself towork wickedness in the sight of the LORD, whom Jezebel his wife stirredup. 

{21:26} And he did very abominably in following idols, according toall [things] as did the Amorites, whom the LORD cast out before thechildren of Israel. 

{21:27} And it came to pass, when Ahab heard thosewords, that he rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his flesh, andfasted, and lay in sackcloth, and went softly. 

{21:28} And the word ofthe LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying, 

{21:29} Seest thou howAhab humbleth himself before me? because he humbleth himself before me,I will not bring the evil in his days: [but] in his son's days will Ibring the evil upon his house.   

{22:1} And they continued three years without war between Syria andIsrael. 

{22:2} And it came to pass in the third year, that Jehoshaphatthe king of Judah came down to the king of Israel. 

{22:3} And the kingof Israel said unto his servants, Know ye that Ramoth in Gilead [is]ours, and we [be] still, [and] take it not out of the hand of the kingof Syria? 

{22:4} And he said unto Jehoshaphat, Wilt thou go with me tobattle to Ramoth- gilead? And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, I[am] as thou [art,] my people as thy people, my horses as thy horses.

{22:5} And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel, Enquire, I praythee, at the word of the LORD to day. 

{22:6} Then the king of Israelgathered the prophets together, about four hundred men, and said untothem, Shall I go against Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall I forbear?And they said, Go up; for the Lord shall deliver [it] into the hand ofthe king. 

{22:7} And Jehoshaphat said, [Is there] not here a prophet ofthe LORD besides, that we might enquire of him? 

{22:8} And the king ofIsrael said unto Jehoshaphat, [There is] yet one man, Micaiah the sonof Imlah, by whom we may enquire of the LORD: but I hate him; for hedoth not prophesy good concerning me, but evil. And Jehoshaphat said,Let not the king say so. 

{22:9} Then the king of Israel called anofficer, and said, Hasten [hither] Micaiah the son of Imlah. 

{22:10}And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah sat each onhis throne, having put on their robes, in a void place in the entranceof the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets prophesied before them.

{22:11} And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made him horns of iron: andhe said, Thus saith the LORD, With these shalt thou push the Syrians,until thou have consumed them. 

{22:12} And all the prophets prophesiedso, saying, Go up to Ramoth- gilead, and prosper: for the LORD shalldeliver [it] into the king's hand. 

{22:13} And the messenger that wasgone to call Micaiah spake unto him, saying, Behold now, the words ofthe prophets [declare] good unto the king with one mouth: let thy word,I pray thee, be like the word of one of them, and speak [that which is]good. 

{22:14} And Micaiah said, [As] the LORD liveth, what the LORDsaith unto me, that will I speak.   

{22:15} So he came to the king. And the king said unto him, Micaiah,shall we go against Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall we forbear? Andhe answered him, Go, and prosper: for the LORD shall deliver [it] intothe hand of the king. 

{22:16} And the king said unto him, How manytimes shall I adjure thee that thou tell me nothing but [that which is]true in the name of the LORD? 

{22:17} And he said, I saw all Israelscattered upon the hills, as sheep that have not a shepherd: and theLORD said, These have no master: let them return every man to his housein peace. 

{22:18} And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, Did Inot tell thee that he would prophesy no good concerning me, but evil?

{22:19} And he said, Hear thou therefore the word of the LORD: I sawthe LORD sitting on his throne, and all the host of heaven standing byhim on his right hand and on his left. 

{22:20} And the LORD said, Whoshall persuade Ahab, that he may go up and fall at Ramoth-gilead? Andone said on this manner, and another said on that manner. 

{22:21} Andthere came forth a spirit, and stood before the LORD, and said, I willpersuade him. 

{22:22} And the LORD said unto him, Wherewith? And hesaid, I will go forth, and I will be a lying spirit in the mouth of allhis prophets. And he said, Thou shalt persuade [him,] and prevail also:go forth, and do so. 

{22:23} Now therefore, behold, the LORD hath put alying spirit in the mouth of all these thy prophets, and the LORD hathspoken evil concerning thee. 

{22:24} But Zedekiah the son of Chenaanahwent near, and smote Micaiah on the cheek, and said, Which way went theSpirit of the LORD from me to speak unto thee? 

{22:25} And Micaiahsaid, Behold, thou shalt see in that day, when thou shalt go into aninner chamber to hide thyself. 

{22:26} And the king of Israel said,Take Micaiah, and carry him back unto Amon the governor of the city,and to Joash the king's son; 

{22:27} And say, Thus saith the king, Putthis [fellow] in the prison, and feed him with bread of affliction andwith water of affliction, until I come in peace. 

{22:28} And Micaiahsaid, If thou return at all in peace, the LORD hath not spoken by me.And he said, Hearken, O people, every one of you. 

{22:29} So the kingof Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth-gilead.

{22:30} And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, I will disguisemyself, and enter into the battle; but put thou on thy robes. And theking of Israel disguised himself, and went into the battle. 

{22:31} Butthe king of Syria commanded his thirty and two captains that had ruleover his chariots, saying, Fight neither with small nor great, saveonly with the king of Israel. 

{22:32} And it came to pass, when thecaptains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, Surely it[is] the king of Israel. And they turned aside to fight against him:and Jehoshaphat cried out. 

{22:33} And it came to pass, when thecaptains of the chariots perceived that it [was] not the king ofIsrael, that they turned back from pursuing him. 

{22:34} And a[certain] man drew a bow at a venture, and smote the king of Israelbetween the joints of the harness: wherefore he said unto the driver ofhis chariot, Turn thine hand, and carry me out of the host; for I amwounded. 

{22:35} And the battle increased that day: and the king wasstayed up in his chariot against the Syrians, and died at even: and theblood ran out of the wound into the midst of the chariot. 

{22:36} Andthere went a proclamation throughout the host about the going down ofthe sun, saying, Every man to his city, and every man to his owncountry.   

{22:37} So the king died, and was brought to Samaria; and theyburied the king in Samaria. 

{22:38} And [one] washed the chariot in thepool of Samaria; and the dogs licked up his blood; and they washed hisarmour; according unto the word of the LORD which he spake. 

{22:39} Nowthe rest of the acts of Ahab, and all that he did, and the ivory housewhich he made, and all the cities that he built, [are] they not writtenin the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? 

{22:40} So Ahabslept with his fathers; and Ahaziah his son reigned in his stead.   

{22:41} And Jehoshaphat the son of Asa began to reign over Judah inthe fourth year of Ahab king of Israel. 

{22:42} Jehoshaphat [was]thirty and five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned twentyand five years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name [was] Azubah thedaughter of Shilhi. 

{22:43} And he walked in all the ways of Asa hisfather; he turned not aside from it, doing [that which was] right inthe eyes of the LORD: nevertheless the high places were not taken away;[for] the people offered and burnt incense yet in the high places.

{22:44} And Jehoshaphat made peace with the king of Israel. 

{22:45} Nowthe rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, and his might that he shewed, andhow he warred, [are] they not written in the book of the chronicles ofthe kings of Judah? 

{22:46} And the remnant of the sodomites, whichremained in the days of his father Asa, he took out of the land.

{22:47} [There was] then no king in Edom: a deputy [was] king. 

{22:48}Jehoshaphat made ships of Tharshish to go to Ophir for gold: but theywent not; for the ships were broken at Ezion-geber. 

{22:49} Then saidAhaziah the son of Ahab unto Jehoshaphat, Let my servants go with thyservants in the ships. But Jehoshaphat would not.   

{22:50} And Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried withhis fathers in the city of David his father: and Jehoram his sonreigned in his stead.   

{22:51} Ahaziah the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel inSamaria the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reignedtwo years over Israel. 

{22:52} And he did evil in the sight of theLORD, and walked in the way of his father, and in the way of hismother, and in the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel tosin: 

{22:53} For he served Baal, and worshipped him, and provoked toanger the LORD God of Israel, according to all that his father had done.
