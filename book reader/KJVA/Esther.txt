{The Book of Esther   

{1:1} Now it came to pass in the days of Ahasuerus, (this [is]Ahasuerus which reigned, from India even unto Ethiopia, [over] anhundred and seven and twenty provinces:) 

{1:2} [That] in those days,when the king Ahasuerus sat on the throne of his kingdom, which [was]in Shushan the palace, 

{1:3} In the third year of his reign, he made afeast unto all his princes and his servants; the power of Persia andMedia, the nobles and princes of the provinces, [being] before him:

{1:4} When he shewed the riches of his glorious kingdom and the honourof his excellent majesty many days, [even] an hundred and fourscoredays. 

{1:5} And when these days were expired, the king made a feastunto all the people that were present in Shushan the palace, both untogreat and small, seven days, in the court of the garden of the king'spalace; 

{1:6} [Where were] white, green, and blue, [hangings,] fastenedwith cords of fine linen and purple to silver rings and pillars ofmarble: the beds [were of] gold and silver, upon a pavement of red, andblue, and white, and black, marble. 

{1:7} And they gave [them] drink invessels of gold, (the vessels being diverse one from another,) androyal wine in abundance, according to the state of the king. 

{1:8} Andthe drinking [was] according to the law; none did compel: for so theking had appointed to all the officers of his house, that they shoulddo according to every man's pleasure. 

{1:9} Also Vashti the queen madea feast for the women [in] the royal house which [belonged] to kingAhasuerus.   

{1:10} On the seventh day, when the heart of the king was merry withwine, he commanded Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, and Abagtha,Zethar, and Carcas, the seven chamberlains that served in the presenceof Ahasuerus the king, 

{1:11} To bring Vashti the queen before the kingwith the crown royal, to shew the people and the princes her beauty:for she [was] fair to look on. 

{1:12} But the queen Vashti refused tocome at the king's commandment by [his] chamberlains: therefore was theking very wroth, and his anger burned in him.   

{1:13} Then the king said to the wise men, which knew the times,(for so [was] the king's manner toward all that knew law and judgment:

{1:14} And the next unto him [was] Carshena, Shethar, Admatha,Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, [and] Memucan, the seven princes of Persiaand Media, which saw the king's face, [and] which sat the first in thekingdom;) 

{1:15} What shall we do unto the queen Vashti according tolaw, because she hath not performed the commandment of the kingAhasuerus by the chamberlains? 

{1:16} And Memucan answered before theking and the princes, Vashti the queen hath not done wrong to the kingonly, but also to all the princes, and to all the people that [are] inall the provinces of the king Ahasuerus. 

{1:17} For [this] deed of thequeen shall come abroad unto all women, so that they shall despisetheir husbands in their eyes, when it shall be reported, The kingAhasuerus commanded Vashti the queen to be brought in before him, butshe came not. 

{1:18} [Likewise] shall the ladies of Persia and Mediasay this day unto all the king's princes, which have heard of the deedof the queen. Thus [shall there arise] too much contempt and wrath.

{1:19} If it please the king, let there go a royal commandment fromhim, and let it be written among the laws of the Persians and theMedes, that it be not altered, That Vashti come no more before kingAhasuerus; and let the king give her royal estate unto another that isbetter than she. 

{1:20} And when the king's decree which he shall makeshall be published throughout all his empire, (for it is great,) allthe wives shall give to their husbands honour, both to great and small.

{1:21} And the saying pleased the king and the princes; and the kingdid according to the word of Memucan: 

{1:22} For he sent letters intoall the king's provinces, into every province according to the writingthereof, and to every people after their language, that every manshould bear rule in his own house, and that [it] should be publishedaccording to the language of every people.   

{2:1} After these things, when the wrath of king Ahasuerus wasappeased, he remembered Vashti, and what she had done, and what wasdecreed against her. 

{2:2} Then said the king's servants thatministered unto him, Let there be fair young virgins sought for theking: 

{2:3} And let the king appoint officers in all the provinces ofhis kingdom, that they may gather together all the fair young virginsunto Shushan the palace, to the house of the women unto the custody ofHege the king's chamberlain, keeper of the women; and let their thingsfor purification be given [them: ]

{2:4} And let the maiden whichpleaseth the king be queen instead of Vashti. And the thing pleased theking; and he did so.   

{2:5} [Now] in Shushan the palace there was a certain Jew, whosename [was] Mordecai, the son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son ofKish, a Benjamite; 

{2:6} Who had been carried away from Jerusalem withthe captivity which had been carried away with Jeconiah king of Judah,whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away. 

{2:7} And hebrought up Hadassah, that [is,] Esther, his uncle's daughter: for shehad neither father nor mother, and the maid [was] fair and beautiful;whom Mordecai, when her father and mother were dead, took for his owndaughter.   

{2:8} So it came to pass, when the king's commandment and his decreewas heard, and when many maidens were gathered together unto Shushanthe palace, to the custody of Hegai, that Esther was brought also untothe king's house, to the custody of Hegai, keeper of the women. 

{2:9}And the maiden pleased him, and she obtained kindness of him; and hespeedily gave her her things for purification, with such things asbelonged to her, and seven maidens, [which were] meet to be given her,out of the king's house: and he preferred her and her maids unto thebest [place] of the house of the women. 

{2:10} Esther had not shewedher people nor her kindred: for Mordecai had charged her that sheshould not shew [it. ]

{2:11} And Mordecai walked every day before thecourt of the women's house, to know how Esther did, and what shouldbecome of her.   

{2:12} Now when every maid's turn was come to go in to kingAhasuerus, after that she had been twelve months, according to themanner of the women, (for so were the days of their purificationsaccomplished, [to wit,] six months with oil of myrrh, and six monthswith sweet odours, and with [other] things for the purifying of thewomen;) 

{2:13} Then thus came [every] maiden unto the king; whatsoevershe desired was given her to go with her out of the house of the womenunto the king's house. 

{2:14} In the evening she went, and on themorrow she returned into the second house of the women, to the custodyof Shaashgaz, the king's chamberlain, which kept the concubines: shecame in unto the king no more, except the king delighted in her, andthat she were called by name.   

{2:15} Now when the turn of Esther, the daughter of Abihail theuncle of Mordecai, who had taken her for his daughter, was come to goin unto the king, she required nothing but what Hegai the king'schamberlain, the keeper of the women, appointed. And Esther obtainedfavour in the sight of all them that looked upon her. 

{2:16} So Estherwas taken unto king Ahasuerus into his house royal in the tenth month,which [is] the month Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign. 

{2:17}And the king loved Esther above all the women, and she obtained graceand favour in his sight more than all the virgins; so that he set theroyal crown upon her head, and made her queen instead of Vashti. 

{2:18}Then the king made a great feast unto all his princes and his servants,[even] Esther's feast; and he made a release to the provinces, and gavegifts, according to the state of the king. 

{2:19} And when the virginswere gathered together the second time, then Mordecai sat in the king'sgate. 

{2:20} Esther had not [yet] shewed her kindred nor her people; asMordecai had charged her: for Esther did the commandment of Mordecai,like as when she was brought up with him.   

{2:21} In those days, while Mordecai sat in the king's gate, two ofthe king's chamberlains, Bigthan and Teresh, of those which kept thedoor, were wroth, and sought to lay hand on the king Ahasuerus. 

{2:22}And the thing was known to Mordecai, who told it unto Esther the queen;and Esther certified the king [thereof] in Mordecai's name. 

{2:23} Andwhen inquisition was made of the matter, it was found out; thereforethey were both hanged on a tree: and it was written in the book of thechronicles before the king.   

{3:1} After these things did king Ahasuerus promote Haman the son ofHammedatha the Agagite, and advanced him, and set his seat above allthe princes that [were] with him. 

{3:2} And all the king's servants,that [were] in the king's gate, bowed, and reverenced Haman: for theking had so commanded concerning him. But Mordecai bowed not, nor did[him] reverence. 

{3:3} Then the king's servants, which [were] in theking's gate, said unto Mordecai, Why transgressest thou the king'scommandment? 

{3:4} Now it came to pass, when they spake daily unto him,and he hearkened not unto them, that they told Haman, to see whetherMordecai's matters would stand: for he had told them that he [was] aJew. 

{3:5} And when Haman saw that Mordecai bowed not, nor did himreverence, then was Haman full of wrath. 

{3:6} And he thought scorn tolay hands on Mordecai alone; for they had shewed him the people ofMordecai: wherefore Haman sought to destroy all the Jews that [were]throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus, [even] the people ofMordecai.   

{3:7} In the first month, that [is,] the month Nisan, in the twelfthyear of king Ahasuerus, they cast Pur, that [is,] the lot, before Hamanfrom day to day, and from month to month, [to] the twelfth [month,]that [is,] the month Adar.   

{3:8} And Haman said unto king Ahasuerus, There is a certain peoplescattered abroad and dispersed among the people in all the provinces ofthy kingdom; and their laws [are] diverse from all people; neither keepthey the king's laws: therefore it [is] not for the king's profit tosuffer them. 

{3:9} If it please the king, let it be written that theymay be destroyed: and I will pay ten thousand talents of silver to thehands of those that have the charge of the business, to bring [it] intothe king's treasuries. 

{3:10} And the king took his ring from his hand,and gave it unto Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the Jews'enemy. 

{3:11} And the king said unto Haman, The silver [is] given tothee, the people also, to do with them as it seemeth good to thee.

{3:12} Then were the king's scribes called on the thirteenth day of thefirst month, and there was written according to all that Haman hadcommanded unto the king's lieutenants, and to the governors that [were]over every province, and to the rulers of every people of everyprovince according to the writing thereof, and [to] every people aftertheir language; in the name of king Ahasuerus was it written, andsealed with the king's ring. 

{3:13} And the letters were sent by postsinto all the king's provinces, to destroy, to kill, and to cause toperish, all Jews, both young and old, little children and women, in oneday, [even] upon the thirteenth [day] of the twelfth month, which [is]the month Adar, and [to take] the spoil of them for a prey. 

{3:14} Thecopy of the writing for a commandment to be given in every province waspublished unto all people, that they should be ready against that day.

{3:15} The posts went out, being hastened by the king's commandment,and the decree was given in Shushan the palace. And the king and Hamansat down to drink; but the city Shushan was perplexed.   

{4:1} When Mordecai perceived all that was done, Mordecai rent hisclothes, and put on sackcloth with ashes, and went out into the midstof the city, and cried with a loud and a bitter cry; 

{4:2} And cameeven before the king's gate: for none [might] enter into the king'sgate clothed with sackcloth. 

{4:3} And in every province, whithersoeverthe king's commandment and his decree came, [there was] great mourningamong the Jews, and fasting, and weeping, and wailing; and many lay insackcloth and ashes.   

{4:4} So Esther's maids and her chamberlains came and told [it] her.Then was the queen exceedingly grieved; and she sent raiment to clotheMordecai, and to take away his sackcloth from him: but he received [it]not. 

{4:5} Then called Esther for Hatach, [one] of the king'schamberlains, whom he had appointed to attend upon her, and gave him acommandment to Mordecai, to know what it [was,] and why it [was. ]

{4:6}So Hatach went forth to Mordecai unto the street of the city, which[was] before the king's gate. 

{4:7} And Mordecai told him of all thathad happened unto him, and of the sum of the money that Haman hadpromised to pay to the king's treasuries for the Jews, to destroy them.

{4:8} Also he gave him the copy of the writing of the decree that wasgiven at Shushan to destroy them, to shew [it] unto Esther, and todeclare [it] unto her, and to charge her that she should go in unto theking, to make supplication unto him, and to make request before him forher people. 

{4:9} And Hatach came and told Esther the words of Mordecai.   

{4:10} Again Esther spake unto Hatach, and gave him commandment untoMordecai; 

{4:11} All the king's servants, and the people of the king'sprovinces, do know, that whosoever, whether man or woman, shall comeunto the king into the inner court, who is not called, [there is] onelaw of his to put [him] to death, except such to whom the king shallhold out the golden sceptre, that he may live: but I have not beencalled to come in unto the king these thirty days. 

{4:12} And they toldto Mordecai Esther's words. 

{4:13} Then Mordecai commanded to answerEsther, Think not with thyself that thou shalt escape in the king'shouse, more than all the Jews. 

{4:14} For if thou altogether holdestthy peace at this time, [then] shall there enlargement and deliverancearise to the Jews from another place; but thou and thy father's houseshall be destroyed: and who knoweth whether thou art come to thekingdom for [such] a time as this?   

{4:15} Then Esther bade [them] return Mordecai [this answer, ]

{4:16}Go, gather together all the Jews that are present in Shushan, and fastye for me, and neither eat nor drink three days, night or day: I alsoand my maidens will fast likewise; and so will I go in unto the king,which [is] not according to the law: and if I perish, I perish. 

{4:17}So Mordecai went his way, and did according to all that Esther hadcommanded him.   

{5:1} Now it came to pass on the third day, that Esther put on [her]royal [apparel,] and stood in the inner court of the king's house, overagainst the king's house: and the king sat upon his royal throne in theroyal house, over against the gate of the house. 

{5:2} And it was so,when the king saw Esther the queen standing in the court, [that] sheobtained favour in his sight: and the king held out to Esther thegolden sceptre that [was] in his hand. So Esther drew near, and touchedthe top of the sceptre. 

{5:3} Then said the king unto her, What wiltthou, queen Esther? and what [is] thy request? it shall be even giventhee to the half of the kingdom. 

{5:4} And Esther answered, If [itseem] good unto the king, let the king and Haman come this day unto thebanquet that I have prepared for him. 

{5:5} Then the king said, CauseHaman to make haste, that he may do as Esther hath said. So the kingand Haman came to the banquet that Esther had prepared.   

{5:6} And the king said unto Esther at the banquet of wine, What[is] thy petition? and it shall be granted thee: and what [is] thyrequest? even to the half of the kingdom it shall be performed. 

{5:7}Then answered Esther, and said, My petition and my request [is; ]

{5:8}If I have found favour in the sight of the king, and if it please theking to grant my petition, and to perform my request, let the king andHaman come to the banquet that I shall prepare for them, and I will doto morrow as the king hath said.   

{5:9} Then went Haman forth that day joyful and with a glad heart:but when Haman saw Mordecai in the king's gate, that he stood not up,nor moved for him, he was full of indignation against Mordecai. 

{5:10}Nevertheless Haman refrained himself: and when he came home, he sentand called for his friends, and Zeresh his wife. 

{5:11} And Haman toldthem of the glory of his riches, and the multitude of his children, andall [the things] wherein the king had promoted him, and how he hadadvanced him above the princes and servants of the king. 

{5:12} Hamansaid moreover, Yea, Esther the queen did let no man come in with theking unto the banquet that she had prepared but myself; and to morrowam I invited unto her also with the king. 

{5:13} Yet all this availethme nothing, so long as I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the king'sgate.   

{5:14} Then said Zeresh his wife and all his friends unto him, Let agallows be made of fifty cubits high, and to morrow speak thou unto theking that Mordecai may be hanged thereon: then go thou in merrily withthe king unto the banquet. And the thing pleased Haman; and he causedthe gallows to be made.   

{6:1} On that night could not the king sleep, and he commanded tobring the book of records of the chronicles; and they were read beforethe king. 

{6:2} And it was found written, that Mordecai had told ofBigthana and Teresh, two of the king's chamberlains, the keepers of thedoor, who sought to lay hand on the king Ahasuerus. 

{6:3} And the kingsaid, What honour and dignity hath been done to Mordecai for this? Thensaid the king's servants that ministered unto him, There is nothingdone for him.   

{6:4} And the king said, Who [is] in the court? Now Haman was comeinto the outward court of the king's house, to speak unto the king tohang Mordecai on the gallows that he had prepared for him. 

{6:5} Andthe king's servants said unto him, Behold, Haman standeth in the court.And the king said, Let him come in. 

{6:6} So Haman came in. And theking said unto him, What shall be done unto the man whom the kingdelighteth to honour? Now Haman thought in his heart, To whom would theking delight to do honour more than to myself? 

{6:7} And Haman answeredthe king, For the man whom the king delighteth to honour, 

{6:8} Let theroyal apparel be brought which the king [useth] to wear, and the horsethat the king rideth upon, and the crown royal which is set upon hishead: 

{6:9} And let this apparel and horse be delivered to the hand ofone of the king's most noble princes, that they may array the man[withal] whom the king delighteth to honour, and bring him on horsebackthrough the street of the city, and proclaim before him, Thus shall itbe done to the man whom the king delighteth to honour. 

{6:10} Then theking said to Haman, Make haste, [and] take the apparel and the horse,as thou hast said, and do even so to Mordecai the Jew, that sitteth atthe king's gate: let nothing fail of all that thou hast spoken. 

{6:11}Then took Haman the apparel and the horse, and arrayed Mordecai, andbrought him on horseback through the street of the city, and proclaimedbefore him, Thus shall it be done unto the man whom the king delightethto honour.   

{6:12} And Mordecai came again to the king's gate. But Haman hastedto his house mourning, and having his head covered. 

{6:13} And Hamantold Zeresh his wife and all his friends every [thing] that hadbefallen him. Then said his wise men and Zeresh his wife unto him, IfMordecai [be] of the seed of the Jews, before whom thou hast begun tofall, thou shalt not prevail against him, but shalt surely fall beforehim. 

{6:14} And while they [were] yet talking with him, came the king'schamberlains, and hasted to bring Haman unto the banquet that Estherhad prepared.   

{7:1} So the king and Haman came to banquet with Esther the queen.

{7:2} And the king said again unto Esther on the second day at thebanquet of wine, What [is] thy petition, queen Esther? and it shall begranted thee: and what [is] thy request? and it shall be performed,[even] to the half of the kingdom. 

{7:3} Then Esther the queen answeredand said, If I have found favour in thy sight, O king, and if it pleasethe king, let my life be given me at my petition, and my people at myrequest: 

{7:4} For we are sold, I and my people, to be destroyed, to beslain, and to perish. But if we had been sold for bondmen andbondwomen, I had held my tongue, although the enemy could notcountervail the king's damage.   

{7:5} Then the king Ahasuerus answered and said unto Esther thequeen, Who is he, and where is he, that durst presume in his heart todo so? 

{7:6} And Esther said, The adversary and enemy [is] this wickedHaman. Then Haman was afraid before the king and the queen.   

{7:7} And the king arising from the banquet of wine in his wrath[went] into the palace garden: and Haman stood up to make request forhis life to Esther the queen; for he saw that there was evil determinedagainst him by the king. 

{7:8} Then the king returned out of the palacegarden into the place of the banquet of wine; and Haman was fallen uponthe bed whereon Esther [was.] Then said the king, Will he force thequeen also before me in the house? As the word went out of the king'smouth, they covered Haman's face. 

{7:9} And Harbonah, one of thechamberlains, said before the king, Behold also, the gallows fiftycubits high, which Haman had made for Mordecai, who had spoken good forthe king, standeth in the house of Haman. Then the king said, Hang himthereon. 

{7:10} So they hanged Haman on the gallows that he hadprepared for Mordecai. Then was the king's wrath pacified.   

{8:1} On that day did the king Ahasuerus give the house of Haman theJews' enemy unto Esther the queen. And Mordecai came before the king;for Esther had told what he [was] unto her. 

{8:2} And the king took offhis ring, which he had taken from Haman, and gave it unto Mordecai. AndEsther set Mordecai over the house of Haman.   

{8:3} And Esther spake yet again before the king, and fell down athis feet, and besought him with tears to put away the mischief of Hamanthe Agagite, and his device that he had devised against the Jews. 

{8:4}Then the king held out the golden sceptre toward Esther. So Estherarose, and stood before the king, 

{8:5} And said, If it please theking, and if I have found favour in his sight, and the thing [seem]right before the king, and I [be] pleasing in his eyes, let it bewritten to reverse the letters devised by Haman the son of Hammedathathe Agagite, which he wrote to destroy the Jews which [are] in all theking's provinces: 

{8:6} For how can I endure to see the evil that shallcome unto my people? or how can I endure to see the destruction of mykindred?   

{8:7} Then the king Ahasuerus said unto Esther the queen and toMordecai the Jew, Behold, I have given Esther the house of Haman, andhim they have hanged upon the gallows, because he laid his hand uponthe Jews. 

{8:8} Write ye also for the Jews, as it liketh you, in theking's name, and seal [it] with the king's ring: for the writing whichis written in the king's name, and sealed with the king's ring, may noman reverse. 

{8:9} Then were the king's scribes called at that time inthe third month, that [is,] the month Sivan, on the three and twentieth[day] thereof; and it was written according to all that Mordecaicommanded unto the Jews, and to the lieutenants, and the deputies andrulers of the provinces which [are] from India unto Ethiopia, anhundred twenty and seven provinces, unto every province according tothe writing thereof, and unto every people after their language, and tothe Jews according to their writing, and according to their language.

{8:10} And he wrote in the king Ahasuerus' name, and sealed it with theking's ring, and sent letters by posts on horseback, [and] riders onmules, camels, [and] young dromedaries: 

{8:11} Wherein the king grantedthe Jews which [were] in every city to gather themselves together, andto stand for their life, to destroy, to slay, and to cause to perish,all the power of the people and province that would assault them,[both] little ones and women, and [to take] the spoil of them for aprey, 

{8:12} Upon one day in all the provinces of king Ahasuerus,[namely,] upon the thirteenth [day] of the twelfth month, which [is]the month Adar. 

{8:13} The copy of the writing for a commandment to begiven in every province [was] published unto all people, and that theJews should be ready against that day to avenge themselves on theirenemies. 

{8:14} [So] the posts that rode upon mules [and] camels wentout, being hastened and pressed on by the king's commandment. And thedecree was given at Shushan the palace.   

{8:15} And Mordecai went out from the presence of the king in royalapparel of blue and white, and with a great crown of gold, and with agarment of fine linen and purple: and the city of Shushan rejoiced andwas glad. 

{8:16} The Jews had light, and gladness, and joy, and honour.

{8:17} And in every province, and in every city, whithersoever theking's commandment and his decree came, the Jews had joy and gladness,a feast and a good day. And many of the people of the land became Jews;for the fear of the Jews fell upon them.   

{9:1} Now in the twelfth month, that [is,] the month Adar, on thethirteenth day of the same, when the king's commandment and his decreedrew near to be put in execution, in the day that the enemies of theJews hoped to have power over them, (though it was turned to thecontrary, that the Jews had rule over them that hated them;) 

{9:2} TheJews gathered themselves together in their cities throughout all theprovinces of the king Ahasuerus, to lay hand on such as sought theirhurt: and no man could withstand them; for the fear of them fell uponall people. 

{9:3} And all the rulers of the provinces, and thelieutenants, and the deputies, and officers of the king, helped theJews; because the fear of Mordecai fell upon them. 

{9:4} For Mordecai[was] great in the king's house, and his fame went out throughout allthe provinces: for this man Mordecai waxed greater and greater. 

{9:5}Thus the Jews smote all their enemies with the stroke of the sword, andslaughter, and destruction, and did what they would unto those thathated them. 

{9:6} And in Shushan the palace the Jews slew and destroyedfive hundred men. 

{9:7} And Parshandatha, and Dalphon, and Aspatha,

{9:8} And Poratha, and Adalia, and Aridatha, 

{9:9} And Parmashta, andArisai, and Aridai, and Vajezatha, 

{9:10} The ten sons of Haman the sonof Hammedatha, the enemy of the Jews, slew they; but on the spoil laidthey not their hand. 

{9:11} On that day the number of those that wereslain in Shushan the palace was brought before the king.   

{9:12} And the king said unto Esther the queen, The Jews have slainand destroyed five hundred men in Shushan the palace, and the ten sonsof Haman; what have they done in the rest of the king's provinces? nowwhat [is] thy petition? and it shall be granted thee: or what [is] thyrequest further? and it shall be done. 

{9:13} Then said Esther, If itplease the king, let it be granted to the Jews which [are] in Shushanto do to morrow also according unto this day's decree, and let Haman'sten sons be hanged upon the gallows. 

{9:14} And the king commanded itso to be done: and the decree was given at Shushan; and they hangedHaman's ten sons. 

{9:15} For the Jews that [were] in Shushan gatheredthemselves together on the fourteenth day also of the month Adar, andslew three hundred men at Shushan; but on the prey they laid not theirhand. 

{9:16} But the other Jews that [were] in the king's provincesgathered themselves together, and stood for their lives, and had restfrom their enemies, and slew of their foes seventy and five thousand,but they laid not their hands on the prey, 

{9:17} On the thirteenth dayof the month Adar; and on the fourteenth day of the same rested they,and made it a day of feasting and gladness. 

{9:18} But the Jews that[were] at Shushan assembled together on the thirteenth [day] thereof;and on the fourteenth thereof; and on the fifteenth [day] of the samethey rested, and made it a day of feasting and gladness. 

{9:19}Therefore the Jews of the villages, that dwelt in the unwalled towns,made the fourteenth day of the month Adar [a day of] gladness andfeasting, and a good day, and of sending portions one to another.   

{9:20} And Mordecai wrote these things, and sent letters unto allthe Jews that [were] in all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus, [both]nigh and far, 

{9:21} To stablish [this] among them, that they shouldkeep the fourteenth day of the month Adar, and the fifteenth day of thesame, yearly, 

{9:22} As the days wherein the Jews rested from theirenemies, and the month which was turned unto them from sorrow to joy,and from mourning into a good day: that they should make them days offeasting and joy, and of sending portions one to another, and gifts tothe poor. 

{9:23} And the Jews undertook to do as they had begun, and asMordecai had written unto them; 

{9:24} Because Haman the son ofHammedatha, the Agagite, the enemy of all the Jews, had devised againstthe Jews to destroy them, and had cast Pur, that [is,] the lot, toconsume them, and to destroy them; 

{9:25} But when [Esther] came beforethe king, he commanded by letters that his wicked device, which hedevised against the Jews, should return upon his own head, and that heand his sons should be hanged on the gallows. 

{9:26} Wherefore theycalled these days Purim after the name of Pur. Therefore for all thewords of this letter, and [of that] which they had seen concerning thismatter, and which had come unto them, 

{9:27} The Jews ordained, andtook upon them, and upon their seed, and upon all such as joinedthemselves unto them, so as it should not fail, that they would keepthese two days according to their writing, and according to their[appointed] time every year; 

{9:28} And [that] these days [should be]remembered and kept throughout every generation, every family, everyprovince, and every city; and [that] these days of Purim should notfail from among the Jews, nor the memorial of them perish from theirseed. 

{9:29} Then Esther the queen, the daughter of Abihail, andMordecai the Jew, wrote with all authority, to confirm this secondletter of Purim. 

{9:30} And he sent the letters unto all the Jews, tothe hundred twenty and seven provinces of the kingdom of Ahasuerus,[with] words of peace and truth, 

{9:31} To confirm these days of Purimin their times [appointed,] according as Mordecai the Jew and Estherthe queen had enjoined them, and as they had decreed for themselves andfor their seed, the matters of the fastings and their cry. 

{9:32} Andthe decree of Esther confirmed these matters of Purim; and it waswritten in the book.   

{10:1} And the king Ahasuerus laid a tribute upon the land, and[upon] the isles of the sea. 

{10:2} And all the acts of his power andof his might, and the declaration of the greatness of Mordecai,whereunto the king advanced him, [are] they not written in the book ofthe chronicles of the kings of Media and Persia? 

{10:3} For Mordecaithe Jew [was] next unto king Ahasuerus, and great among the Jews, andaccepted of the multitude of his brethren, seeking the wealth of hispeople, and speaking peace to all his seed.
