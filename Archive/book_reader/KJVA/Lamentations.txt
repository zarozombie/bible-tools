{The Lamentations of Jeremiah   

{1:1} How doth the city sit solitary, [that was] full of people[how] is she become as a widow she [that was] great among the nations,[and] princess among the provinces, [how] is she become tributary 

{1:2}She weepeth sore in the night, and her tears [are] on her cheeks: amongall her lovers she hath none to comfort [her:] all her friends havedealt treacherously with her, they are become her enemies. 

{1:3} Judahis gone into captivity because of affliction, and because of greatservitude: she dwelleth among the heathen, she findeth no rest: all herpersecutors overtook her between the straits. 

{1:4} The ways of Zion domourn, because none come to the solemn feasts: all her gates aredesolate: her priests sigh, her virgins are afflicted, and she [is] inbitterness. 

{1:5} Her adversaries are the chief, her enemies prosper;for the LORD hath afflicted her for the multitude of hertransgressions: her children are gone into captivity before the enemy.

{1:6} And from the daughter of Zion all her beauty is departed: herprinces are become like harts [that] find no pasture, and they are gonewithout strength before the pursuer. 

{1:7} Jerusalem remembered in thedays of her affliction and of her miseries all her pleasant things thatshe had in the days of old, when her people fell into the hand of theenemy, and none did help her: the adversaries saw her, [and] did mockat her sabbaths. 

{1:8} Jerusalem hath grievously sinned; therefore sheis removed: all that honoured her despise her, because they have seenher nakedness: yea, she sigheth, and turneth backward. 

{1:9} Herfilthiness [is] in her skirts; she remembereth not her last end;therefore she came down wonderfully: she had no comforter. O LORD,behold my affliction: for the enemy hath magnified [himself. ]

{1:10}The adversary hath spread out his hand upon all her pleasant things:for she hath seen [that] the heathen entered into her sanctuary, whomthou didst command [that] they should not enter into thy congregation.

{1:11} All her people sigh, they seek bread; they have given theirpleasant things for meat to relieve the soul: see, O LORD, andconsider; for I am become vile.   

{1:12} [Is it] nothing to you, all ye that pass by? behold, and seeif there be any sorrow like unto my sorrow, which is done unto me,wherewith the LORD hath afflicted [me] in the day of his fierce anger.

{1:13} From above hath he sent fire into my bones, and it prevailethagainst them: he hath spread a net for my feet, he hath turned me back:he hath made me desolate [and] faint all the day. 

{1:14} The yoke of mytransgressions is bound by his hand: they are wreathed, [and] come upupon my neck: he hath made my strength to fall, the Lord hath deliveredme into [their] hands, [from whom] I am not able to rise up. 

{1:15} TheLord hath trodden under foot all my mighty [men] in the midst of me: hehath called an assembly against me to crush my young men: the Lord hathtrodden the virgin, the daughter of Judah, [as] in a winepress. 

{1:16}For these [things] I weep; mine eye, mine eye runneth down with water,because the comforter that should relieve my soul is far from me: mychildren are desolate, because the enemy prevailed. 

{1:17} Zionspreadeth forth her hands, [and there is] none to comfort her: the LORDhath commanded concerning Jacob, [that] his adversaries [should be]round about him: Jerusalem is as a menstruous woman among them.   

{1:18} The LORD is righteous; for I have rebelled against hiscommandment: hear, I pray you, all people, and behold my sorrow: myvirgins and my young men are gone into captivity. 

{1:19} I called formy lovers, [but] they deceived me: my priests and mine elders gave upthe ghost in the city, while they sought their meat to relieve theirsouls. 

{1:20} Behold, O LORD; for I [am] in distress: my bowels aretroubled; mine heart is turned within me; for I have grievouslyrebelled: abroad the sword bereaveth, at home [there is] as death.

{1:21} They have heard that I sigh: [there is] none to comfort me: allmine enemies have heard of my trouble; they are glad that thou hastdone [it:] thou wilt bring the day [that] thou hast called, and theyshall be like unto me. 

{1:22} Let all their wickedness come beforethee; and do unto them, as thou hast done unto me for all mytransgressions: for my sighs [are] many, and my heart [is] faint.   

{2:1} How hath the Lord covered the daughter of Zion with a cloud inhis anger, [and] cast down from heaven unto the earth the beauty ofIsrael, and remembered not his footstool in the day of his anger! 

{2:2}The Lord hath swallowed up all the habitations of Jacob, and hath notpitied: he hath thrown down in his wrath the strong holds of thedaughter of Judah; he hath brought [them] down to the ground: he hathpolluted the kingdom and the princes thereof. 

{2:3} He hath cut off in[his] fierce anger all the horn of Israel: he hath drawn back his righthand from before the enemy, and he burned against Jacob like a flamingfire, [which] devoureth round about. 

{2:4} He hath bent his bow like anenemy: he stood with his right hand as an adversary, and slew all [thatwere] pleasant to the eye in the tabernacle of the daughter of Zion: hepoured out his fury like fire. 

{2:5} The Lord was as an enemy: he hathswallowed up Israel, he hath swallowed up all her palaces: he hathdestroyed his strong holds, and hath increased in the daughter of Judahmourning and lamentation. 

{2:6} And he hath violently taken away histabernacle, as [if it were of] a garden: he hath destroyed his placesof the assembly: the LORD hath caused the solemn feasts and sabbaths tobe forgotten in Zion, and hath despised in the indignation of his angerthe king and the priest. 

{2:7} The Lord hath cast off his altar, hehath abhorred his sanctuary, he hath given up into the hand of theenemy the walls of her palaces; they have made a noise in the house ofthe LORD, as in the day of a solemn feast. 

{2:8} The LORD hath purposedto destroy the wall of the daughter of Zion: he hath stretched out aline, he hath not withdrawn his hand from destroying: therefore he madethe rampart and the wall to lament; they languished together. 

{2:9} Hergates are sunk into the ground; he hath destroyed and broken her bars:her king and her princes [are] among the Gentiles: the law [is] no[more;] her prophets also find no vision from the LORD. 

{2:10} Theelders of the daughter of Zion sit upon the ground, [and] keep silence:they have cast up dust upon their heads; they have girded themselveswith sackcloth: the virgins of Jerusalem hang down their heads to theground. 

{2:11} Mine eyes do fail with tears, my bowels are troubled, myliver is poured upon the earth, for the destruction of the daughter ofmy people; because the children and the sucklings swoon in the streetsof the city. 

{2:12} They say to their mothers, Where [is] corn andwine? when they swooned as the wounded in the streets of the city, whentheir soul was poured out into their mothers' bosom. 

{2:13} What thingshall I take to witness for thee? what thing shall I liken to thee, Odaughter of Jerusalem? what shall I equal to thee, that I may comfortthee, O virgin daughter of Zion? for thy breach is great like the sea:who can heal thee? 

{2:14} Thy prophets have seen vain and foolishthings for thee: and they have not discovered thine iniquity, to turnaway thy captivity; but have seen for thee false burdens and causes ofbanishment. 

{2:15} All that pass by clap [their] hands at thee; theyhiss and wag their head at the daughter of Jerusalem, [saying, Is] thisthe city that [men] call The perfection of beauty, The joy of the wholeearth? 

{2:16} All thine enemies have opened their mouth against thee:they hiss and gnash the teeth: they say, We have swallowed [her] up:certainly this [is] the day that we looked for; we have found, we haveseen [it. ]

{2:17} The LORD hath done [that] which he had devised; hehath fulfilled his word that he had commanded in the days of old: hehath thrown down, and hath not pitied: and he hath caused [thine] enemyto rejoice over thee, he hath set up the horn of thine adversaries.

{2:18} Their heart cried unto the Lord, O wall of the daughter of Zion,let tears run down like a river day and night: give thyself no rest;let not the apple of thine eye cease. 

{2:19} Arise, cry out in thenight: in the beginning of the watches pour out thine heart like waterbefore the face of the Lord: lift up thy hands toward him for the lifeof thy young children, that faint for hunger in the top of every street.   

{2:20} Behold, O LORD, and consider to whom thou hast done this.Shall the women eat their fruit, [and] children of a span long? shallthe priest and the prophet be slain in the sanctuary of the Lord?

{2:21} The young and the old lie on the ground in the streets: myvirgins and my young men are fallen by the sword; thou hast slain[them] in the day of thine anger; thou hast killed, [and] not pitied.

{2:22} Thou hast called as in a solemn day my terrors round about, sothat in the day of the LORD'S anger none escaped nor remained: thosethat I have swaddled and brought up hath mine enemy consumed.   

{3:1} I [am] the man [that] hath seen affliction by the rod of hiswrath. 

{3:2} He hath led me, and brought [me into] darkness, but not[into] light. 

{3:3} Surely against me is he turned; he turneth his hand[against me] all the day. 

{3:4} My flesh and my skin hath he made old;he hath broken my bones. 

{3:5} He hath builded against me, andcompassed [me] with gall and travail. 

{3:6} He hath set me in darkplaces, as [they that be] dead of old. 

{3:7} He hath hedged me about,that I cannot get out: he hath made my chain heavy. 

{3:8} Also when Icry and shout, he shutteth out my prayer. 

{3:9} He hath inclosed myways with hewn stone, he hath made my paths crooked. 

{3:10} He [was]unto me [as] a bear lying in wait, [and as] a lion in secret places.

{3:11} He hath turned aside my ways, and pulled me in pieces: he hathmade me desolate. 

{3:12} He hath bent his bow, and set me as a mark forthe arrow. 

{3:13} He hath caused the arrows of his quiver to enter intomy reins. 

{3:14} I was a derision to all my people; [and] their songall the day. 

{3:15} He hath filled me with bitterness, he hath made medrunken with wormwood. 

{3:16} He hath also broken my teeth with gravelstones, he hath covered me with ashes. 

{3:17} And thou hast removed mysoul far off from peace: I forgat prosperity. 

{3:18} And I said, Mystrength and my hope is perished from the LORD: 

{3:19} Remembering mineaffliction and my misery, the wormwood and the gall. 

{3:20} My soulhath [them] still in remembrance, and is humbled in me. 

{3:21} This Irecall to my mind, therefore have I hope.   

{3:22} [It is of] the LORD'S mercies that we are not consumed,because his compassions fail not. 

{3:23} [They are] new every morning:great [is] thy faithfulness. 

{3:24} The LORD [is] my portion, saith mysoul; therefore will I hope in him. 

{3:25} The LORD [is] good unto themthat wait for him, to the soul [that] seeketh him. 

{3:26} [It is] goodthat [a man] should both hope and quietly wait for the salvation of theLORD. 

{3:27} [It is] good for a man that he bear the yoke in his youth.

{3:28} He sitteth alone and keepeth silence, because he hath borne itupon him. 

{3:29} He putteth his mouth in the dust; if so be there maybe hope. 

{3:30} He giveth [his] cheek to him that smiteth him: he isfilled full with reproach. 

{3:31} For the Lord will not cast off forever: 

{3:32} But though he cause grief, yet will he have compassionaccording to the multitude of his mercies. 

{3:33} For he doth notafflict willingly nor grieve the children of men. 

{3:34} To crush underhis feet all the prisoners of the earth, 

{3:35} To turn aside the rightof a man before the face of the most High, 

{3:36} To subvert a man inhis cause, the Lord approveth not. 

{3:37} Who [is] he [that] saith, andit cometh to pass, [when] the Lord commandeth [it] not? 

{3:38} Out ofthe mouth of the most High proceedeth not evil and good? 

{3:39}Wherefore doth a living man complain, a man for the punishment of hissins? 

{3:40} Let us search and try our ways, and turn again to theLORD. 

{3:41} Let us lift up our heart with [our] hands unto God in theheavens. 

{3:42} We have transgressed and have rebelled: thou hast notpardoned. 

{3:43} Thou hast covered with anger, and persecuted us: thouhast slain, thou hast not pitied. 

{3:44} Thou hast covered thyself witha cloud, that [our] prayer should not pass through. 

{3:45} Thou hastmade us [as] the offscouring and refuse in the midst of the people.

{3:46} All our enemies have opened their mouths against us. 

{3:47} Fearand a snare is come upon us, desolation and destruction. 

{3:48} Mineeye runneth down with rivers of water for the destruction of thedaughter of my people. 

{3:49} Mine eye trickleth down, and ceaseth not,without any intermission, 

{3:50} Till the LORD look down, and beholdfrom heaven. 

{3:51} Mine eye affecteth mine heart because of all thedaughters of my city. 

{3:52} Mine enemies chased me sore, like a bird,without cause. 

{3:53} They have cut off my life in the dungeon, andcast a stone upon me. 

{3:54} Waters flowed over mine head; [then] Isaid, I am cut off. 

{3:55} I called upon thy name, O LORD, out of thelow dungeon. 

{3:56} Thou hast heard my voice: hide not thine ear at mybreathing, at my cry. 

{3:57} Thou drewest near in the day [that] Icalled upon thee: thou saidst, Fear not. 

{3:58} O Lord, thou hastpleaded the causes of my soul; thou hast redeemed my life. 

{3:59} OLORD, thou hast seen my wrong: judge thou my cause. 

{3:60} Thou hastseen all their vengeance [and] all their imaginations against me.

{3:61} Thou hast heard their reproach, O LORD, [and] all theirimaginations against me; 

{3:62} The lips of those that rose up againstme, and their device against me all the day. 

{3:63} Behold theirsitting down, and their rising up; I [am] their musick.   

{3:64} Render unto them a recompence, O LORD, according to the workof their hands. 

{3:65} Give them sorrow of heart, thy curse unto them.

{3:66} Persecute and destroy them in anger from under the heavens ofthe LORD.   

{4:1} How is the gold become dim! [how] is the most fine goldchanged! the stones of the sanctuary are poured out in the top of everystreet. 

{4:2} The precious sons of Zion, comparable to fine gold, howare they esteemed as earthen pitchers, the work of the hands of thepotter! 

{4:3} Even the sea monsters draw out the breast, they give suckto their young ones: the daughter of my people [is become] cruel, likethe ostriches in the wilderness. 

{4:4} The tongue of the sucking childcleaveth to the roof of his mouth for thirst: the young children askbread, [and] no man breaketh [it] unto them. 

{4:5} They that did feeddelicately are desolate in the streets: they that were brought up inscarlet embrace dunghills. 

{4:6} For the punishment of the iniquity ofthe daughter of my people is greater than the punishment of the sin ofSodom, that was overthrown as in a moment, and no hands stayed on her.

{4:7} Her Nazarites were purer than snow, they were whiter than milk,they were more ruddy in body than rubies, their polishing [was] ofsapphire: 

{4:8} Their visage is blacker than a coal; they are not knownin the streets: their skin cleaveth to their bones; it is withered, itis become like a stick. 

{4:9} [They that be] slain with the sword arebetter than [they that be] slain with hunger: for these pine away,stricken through for [want of] the fruits of the field. 

{4:10} Thehands of the pitiful women have sodden their own children: they weretheir meat in the destruction of the daughter of my people. 

{4:11} TheLORD hath accomplished his fury; he hath poured out his fierce anger,and hath kindled a fire in Zion, and it hath devoured the foundationsthereof. 

{4:12} The kings of the earth, and all the inhabitants of theworld, would not have believed that the adversary and the enemy shouldhave entered into the gates of Jerusalem.   

{4:13} For the sins of her prophets, [and] the iniquities of herpriests, that have shed the blood of the just in the midst of her,

{4:14} They have wandered [as] blind [men] in the streets, they havepolluted themselves with blood, so that men could not touch theirgarments. 

{4:15} They cried unto them, Depart ye; [it is] unclean;depart, depart, touch not: when they fled away and wandered, they saidamong the heathen, They shall no more sojourn [there. ]

{4:16} The angerof the LORD hath divided them; he will no more regard them: theyrespected not the persons of the priests, they favoured not the elders.

{4:17} As for us, our eyes as yet failed for our vain help: in ourwatching we have watched for a nation [that] could not save [us.]

{4:18} They hunt our steps, that we cannot go in our streets: our endis near, our days are fulfilled; for our end is come. 

{4:19} Ourpersecutors are swifter than the eagles of the heaven: they pursued usupon the mountains, they laid wait for us in the wilderness. 

{4:20} Thebreath of our nostrils, the anointed of the LORD, was taken in theirpits, of whom we said, Under his shadow we shall live among the heathen.   

{4:21} Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of Edom, that dwellest in theland of Uz; the cup also shall pass through unto thee: thou shalt bedrunken, and shalt make thyself naked.   

{4:22} The punishment of thine iniquity is accomplished, O daughterof Zion; he will no more carry thee away into captivity: he will visitthine iniquity, O daughter of Edom; he will discover thy sins.   

{5:1} Remember, O LORD, what is come upon us: consider, and beholdour reproach. 

{5:2} Our inheritance is turned to strangers, our housesto aliens. 

{5:3} We are orphans and fatherless, our mothers [are] aswidows. 

{5:4} We have drunken our water for money; our wood is soldunto us. 

{5:5} Our necks [are] under persecution: we labour, [and] haveno rest. 

{5:6} We have given the hand [to] the Egyptians, [and to] theAssyrians, to be satisfied with bread. 

{5:7} Our fathers have sinned,[and are] not; and we have borne their iniquities. 

{5:8} Servants haveruled over us: [there is] none that doth deliver [us] out of theirhand. 

{5:9} We gat our bread with [the peril of] our lives because ofthe sword of the wilderness. 

{5:10} Our skin was black like an ovenbecause of the terrible famine. 

{5:11} They ravished the women in Zion,[and] the maids in the cities of Judah. 

{5:12} Princes are hanged up bytheir hand: the faces of elders were not honoured. 

{5:13} They took theyoung men to grind, and the children fell under the wood. 

{5:14} Theelders have ceased from the gate, the young men from their musick.

{5:15} The joy of our heart is ceased; our dance is turned intomourning. 

{5:16} The crown is fallen [from] our head: woe unto us, thatwe have sinned! 

{5:17} For this our heart is faint; for these [things]our eyes are dim. 

{5:18} Because of the mountain of Zion, which isdesolate, the foxes walk upon it. 

{5:19} Thou, O LORD, remainest forever; thy throne from generation to generation. 

{5:20} Wherefore dostthou forget us for ever, [and] forsake us so long time? 

{5:21} Turnthou us unto thee, O LORD, and we shall be turned; renew our days as ofold. 

{5:22} But thou hast utterly rejected us; thou art very wrothagainst us.
