{The Book of Judges   

{1:1} Now after the death of Joshua it came to pass, that thechildren of Israel asked the LORD, saying, Who shall go up for usagainst the Canaanites first, to fight against them? 

{1:2} And the LORDsaid, Judah shall go up: behold, I have delivered the land into hishand. 

{1:3} And Judah said unto Simeon his brother, Come up with meinto my lot, that we may fight against the Canaanites; and I likewisewill go with thee into thy lot. So Simeon went with him. 

{1:4} AndJudah went up; and the LORD delivered the Canaanites and the Perizzitesinto their hand: and they slew of them in Bezek ten thousand men. 

{1:5}And they found Adoni-bezek in Bezek: and they fought against him, andthey slew the Canaanites and the Perizzites. 

{1:6} But Adoni-bezekfled; and they pursued after him, and caught him, and cut off histhumbs and his great toes. 

{1:7} And Adoni-bezek said, Threescore andten kings, having their thumbs and their great toes cut off, gathered[their meat] under my table: as I have done, so God hath requited me.And they brought him to Jerusalem, and there he died. 

{1:8} Now thechildren of Judah had fought against Jerusalem, and had taken it, andsmitten it with the edge of the sword, and set the city on fire.   

{1:9} And afterward the children of Judah went down to fight againstthe Canaanites, that dwelt in the mountain, and in the south, and inthe valley. 

{1:10} And Judah went against the Canaanites that dwelt inHebron: (now the name of Hebron before [was] Kirjath- arba:) and theyslew Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai. 

{1:11} And from thence he wentagainst the inhabitants of Debir: and the name of Debir before [was]Kirjath-sepher: 

{1:12} And Caleb said, He that smiteth Kirjath-sepher,and taketh it, to him will I give Achsah my daughter to wife. 

{1:13}And Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother, took it: and hegave him Achsah his daughter to wife. 

{1:14} And it came to pass, whenshe came [to him,] that she moved him to ask of her father a field: andshe lighted from off [her] ass; and Caleb said unto her, What wiltthou? 

{1:15} And she said unto him, Give me a blessing: for thou hastgiven me a south land; give me also springs of water. And Caleb gaveher the upper springs and the nether springs.   

{1:16} And the children of the Kenite, Moses' father in law, went upout of the city of palm trees with the children of Judah into thewilderness of Judah, which [lieth] in the south of Arad; and they wentand dwelt among the people. 

{1:17} And Judah went with Simeon hisbrother, and they slew the Canaanites that inhabited Zephath, andutterly destroyed it. And the name of the city was called Hormah.

{1:18} Also Judah took Gaza with the coast thereof, and Askelon withthe coast thereof, and Ekron with the coast thereof. 

{1:19} And theLORD was with Judah; and he drave out the inhabitants of the mountain;but could not drive out [the inhabitants of] the valley, because theyhad chariots of iron. 

{1:20} And they gave Hebron unto Caleb, as Mosessaid: and he expelled thence the three sons of Anak. 

{1:21} And thechildren of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites that inhabitedJerusalem; but the Jebusites dwell with the children of Benjamin inJerusalem unto this day.   

{1:22} And the house of Joseph, they also went up against Bethel:and the LORD [was] with them. 

{1:23} And the house of Joseph sent todescry Bethel. (Now the name of the city before [was] Luz.) 

{1:24} Andthe spies saw a man come forth out of the city, and they said unto him,Shew us, we pray thee, the entrance into the city, and we will shewthee mercy. 

{1:25} And when he shewed them the entrance into the city,they smote the city with the edge of the sword; but they let go the manand all his family. 

{1:26} And the man went into the land of theHittites, and built a city, and called the name thereof Luz: which [is]the name thereof unto this day.   

{1:27} Neither did Manasseh drive out [the inhabitants of]Beth-shean and her towns, nor Taanach and her towns, nor theinhabitants of Dor and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Ibleam and hertowns, nor the inhabitants of Megiddo and her towns: but the Canaaniteswould dwell in that land. 

{1:28} And it came to pass, when Israel wasstrong, that they put the Canaanites to tribute, and did not utterlydrive them out.   

{1:29} Neither did Ephraim drive out the Canaanites that dwelt inGezer; but the Canaanites dwelt in Gezer among them.   

{1:30} Neither did Zebulun drive out the inhabitants of Kitron, northe inhabitants of Nahalol; but the Canaanites dwelt among them, andbecame tributaries.   

{1:31} Neither did Asher drive out the inhabitants of Accho, nor theinhabitants of Zidon, nor of Ahlab, nor of Achzib, nor of Helbah, norof Aphik, nor of Rehob: 

{1:32} But the Asherites dwelt among theCanaanites, the inhabitants of the land: for they did not drive themout.   

{1:33} Neither did Naphtali drive out the inhabitants ofBeth-shemesh, nor the inhabitants of Beth-anath; but he dwelt among theCanaanites, the inhabitants of the land: nevertheless the inhabitantsof Beth-shemesh and of Beth-anath became tributaries unto them. 

{1:34}And the Amorites forced the children of Dan into the mountain: for theywould not suffer them to come down to the valley: 

{1:35} But theAmorites would dwell in mount Heres in Aijalon, and in Shaalbim: yetthe hand of the house of Joseph prevailed, so that they becametributaries. 

{1:36} And the coast of the Amorites [was] from the goingup to Akrabbim, from the rock, and upward.   

{2:1} And an angel of the LORD came up from Gilgal to Bochim, andsaid, I made you to go up out of Egypt, and have brought you unto theland which I sware unto your fathers; and I said, I will never break mycovenant with you. 

{2:2} And ye shall make no league with theinhabitants of this land; ye shall throw down their altars: but ye havenot obeyed my voice: why have ye done this? 

{2:3} Wherefore I alsosaid, I will not drive them out from before you; but they shall be [asthorns] in your sides, and their gods shall be a snare unto you. 

{2:4}And it came to pass, when the angel of the LORD spake these words untoall the children of Israel, that the people lifted up their voice, andwept. 

{2:5} And they called the name of that place Bochim: and theysacrificed there unto the LORD.   

{2:6} And when Joshua had let the people go, the children of Israelwent every man unto his inheritance to possess the land. 

{2:7} And thepeople served the LORD all the days of Joshua, and all the days of theelders that outlived Joshua, who had seen all the great works of theLORD, that he did for Israel. 

{2:8} And Joshua the son of Nun, theservant of the LORD, died, [being] an hundred and ten years old. 

{2:9}And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnath-heres,in the mount of Ephraim, on the north side of the hill Gaash. 

{2:10}And also all that generation were gathered unto their fathers: andthere arose another generation after them, which knew not the LORD, noryet the works which he had done for Israel.   

{2:11} And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD,and served Baalim: 

{2:12} And they forsook the LORD God of theirfathers, which brought them out of the land of Egypt, and followedother gods, of the gods of the people that [were] round about them, andbowed themselves unto them, and provoked the LORD to anger. 

{2:13} Andthey forsook the LORD, and served Baal and Ashtaroth.   

{2:14} And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and hedelivered them into the hands of spoilers that spoiled them, and hesold them into the hands of their enemies round about, so that theycould not any longer stand before their enemies. 

{2:15} Whithersoeverthey went out, the hand of the LORD was against them for evil, as theLORD had said, and as the LORD had sworn unto them: and they weregreatly distressed.   

{2:16} Nevertheless the LORD raised up judges, which delivered themout of the hand of those that spoiled them. 

{2:17} And yet they wouldnot hearken unto their judges, but they went a whoring after othergods, and bowed themselves unto them: they turned quickly out of theway which their fathers walked in, obeying the commandments of theLORD; [but] they did not so. 

{2:18} And when the LORD raised them upjudges, then the LORD was with the judge, and delivered them out of thehand of their enemies all the days of the judge: for it repented theLORD because of their groanings by reason of them that oppressed themand vexed them. 

{2:19} And it came to pass, when the judge was dead,[that] they returned, and corrupted [themselves] more than theirfathers, in following other gods to serve them, and to bow down untothem; they ceased not from their own doings, nor from their stubbornway.   

{2:20} And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel; and hesaid, Because that this people hath transgressed my covenant which Icommanded their fathers, and have not hearkened unto my voice; 

{2:21} Ialso will not henceforth drive out any from before them of the nationswhich Joshua left when he died: 

{2:22} That through them I may proveIsrael, whether they will keep the way of the LORD to walk therein, astheir fathers did keep [it,] or not. 

{2:23} Therefore the LORD leftthose nations, without driving them out hastily; neither delivered hethem into the hand of Joshua.   

{3:1} Now these [are] the nations which the LORD left, to proveIsrael by them, [even] as many [of Israel] as had not known all thewars of Canaan; 

{3:2} Only that the generations of the children ofIsrael might know, to teach them war, at the least such as before knewnothing thereof; 

{3:3} [Namely,] five lords of the Philistines, and allthe Canaanites, and the Sidonians, and the Hivites that dwelt in mountLebanon, from mount Baal-hermon unto the entering in of Hamath. 

{3:4}And they were to prove Israel by them, to know whether they wouldhearken unto the commandments of the LORD, which he commanded theirfathers by the hand of Moses.   

{3:5} And the children of Israel dwelt among the Canaanites,Hittites, and Amorites, and Perizzites, and Hivites, and Jebusites:

{3:6} And they took their daughters to be their wives, and gave theirdaughters to their sons, and served their gods. 

{3:7} And the childrenof Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD, and forgat the LORD theirGod, and served Baalim and the groves.   

{3:8} Therefore the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and hesold them into the hand of Chushan-rishathaim king of Mesopotamia: andthe children of Israel served Chushan-rishathaim eight years. 

{3:9} Andwhen the children of Israel cried unto the LORD, the LORD raised up adeliverer to the children of Israel, who delivered them, [even] Othnielthe son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother. 

{3:10} And the Spirit of theLORD came upon him, and he judged Israel, and went out to war: and theLORD delivered Chushan- rishathaim king of Mesopotamia into his hand;and his hand prevailed against Chushan- rishathaim. 

{3:11} And the landhad rest forty years. And Othniel the son of Kenaz died.   

{3:12} And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of theLORD: and the LORD strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel,because they had done evil in the sight of the LORD. 

{3:13} And hegathered unto him the children of Ammon and Amalek, and went and smoteIsrael, and possessed the city of palm trees. 

{3:14} So the children ofIsrael served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years. 

{3:15} But whenthe children of Israel cried unto the LORD, the LORD raised them up adeliverer, Ehud the son of Gera, a Benjamite, a man lefthanded: and byhim the children of Israel sent a present unto Eglon the king of Moab.

{3:16} But Ehud made him a dagger which had two edges, of a cubitlength; and he did gird it under his raiment upon his right thigh.

{3:17} And he brought the present unto Eglon king of Moab: and Eglon[was] a very fat man. 

{3:18} And when he had made an end to offer thepresent, he sent away the people that bare the present. 

{3:19} But hehimself turned again from the quarries that [were] by Gilgal, and said,I have a secret errand unto thee, O king: who said, Keep silence. Andall that stood by him went out from him. 

{3:20} And Ehud came unto him;and he was sitting in a summer parlour, which he had for himself alone.And Ehud said, I have a message from God unto thee. And he arose out of[his] seat. 

{3:21} And Ehud put forth his left hand, and took thedagger from his right thigh, and thrust it into his belly: 

{3:22} Andthe haft also went in after the blade; and the fat closed upon theblade, so that he could not draw the dagger out of his belly; and thedirt came out. 

{3:23} Then Ehud went forth through the porch, and shutthe doors of the parlour upon him, and locked them. 

{3:24} When he wasgone out, his servants came; and when they saw that, behold, the doorsof the parlour [were] locked, they said, Surely he covereth his feet inhis summer chamber. 

{3:25} And they tarried till they were ashamed:and, behold, he opened not the doors of the parlour; therefore theytook a key, and opened [them:] and, behold, their lord [was] fallendown dead on the earth. 

{3:26} And Ehud escaped while they tarried, andpassed beyond the quarries, and escaped unto Seirath. 

{3:27} And itcame to pass, when he was come, that he blew a trumpet in the mountainof Ephraim, and the children of Israel went down with him from themount, and he before them. 

{3:28} And he said unto them, Follow afterme: for the LORD hath delivered your enemies the Moabites into yourhand. And they went down after him, and took the fords of Jordan towardMoab, and suffered not a man to pass over. 

{3:29} And they slew of Moabat that time about ten thousand men, all lusty, and all men of valour;and there escaped not a man. 

{3:30} So Moab was subdued that day underthe hand of Israel. And the land had rest fourscore years.   

{3:31} And after him was Shamgar the son of Anath, which slew of thePhilistines six hundred men with an ox goad: and he also deliveredIsrael.   

{4:1} And the children of Israel again did evil in the sight of theLORD, when Ehud was dead. 

{4:2} And the LORD sold them into the hand ofJabin king of Canaan, that reigned in Hazor; the captain of whose host[was] Sisera, which dwelt in Harosheth of the Gentiles. 

{4:3} And thechildren of Israel cried unto the LORD: for he had nine hundredchariots of iron; and twenty years he mightily oppressed the childrenof Israel.   

{4:4} And Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lapidoth, she judgedIsrael at that time. 

{4:5} And she dwelt under the palm tree of Deborahbetween Ramah and Bethel in mount Ephraim: and the children of Israelcame up to her for judgment. 

{4:6} And she sent and called Barak theson of Abinoam out of Kedesh-naphtali, and said unto him, Hath not theLORD God of Israel commanded, [saying,] Go and draw toward mount Tabor,and take with thee ten thousand men of the children of Naphtali and ofthe children of Zebulun? 

{4:7} And I will draw unto thee to the riverKishon Sisera, the captain of Jabin's army, with his chariots and hismultitude; and I will deliver him into thine hand. 

{4:8} And Barak saidunto her, If thou wilt go with me, then I will go: but if thou wilt notgo with me, [then] I will not go. 

{4:9} And she said, I will surely gowith thee: notwithstanding the journey that thou takest shall not befor thine honour; for the LORD shall sell Sisera into the hand of awoman. And Deborah arose, and went with Barak to Kedesh.   

{4:10} And Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh; and he wentup with ten thousand men at his feet: and Deborah went up with him.

{4:11} Now Heber the Kenite, [which was] of the children of Hobab thefather in law of Moses, had severed himself from the Kenites, andpitched his tent unto the plain of Zaanaim, which [is] by Kedesh.

{4:12} And they shewed Sisera that Barak the son of Abinoam was gone upto mount Tabor. 

{4:13} And Sisera gathered together all his chariots,[even] nine hundred chariots of iron, and all the people that [were]with him, from Harosheth of the Gentiles unto the river of Kishon.

{4:14} And Deborah said unto Barak, Up; for this [is] the day in whichthe LORD hath delivered Sisera into thine hand: is not the LORD goneout before thee? So Barak went down from mount Tabor, and ten thousandmen after him. 

{4:15} And the LORD discomfited Sisera, and all [his]chariots, and all [his] host, with the edge of the sword before Barak;so that Sisera lighted down off [his] chariot, and fled away on hisfeet. 

{4:16} But Barak pursued after the chariots, and after the host,unto Harosheth of the Gentiles: and all the host of Sisera fell uponthe edge of the sword; [and] there was not a man left. 

{4:17} HowbeitSisera fled away on his feet to the tent of Jael the wife of Heber theKenite: for [there was] peace between Jabin the king of Hazor and thehouse of Heber the Kenite.   

{4:18} And Jael went out to meet Sisera, and said unto him, Turn in,my lord, turn in to me; fear not. And when he had turned in unto herinto the tent, she covered him with a mantle. 

{4:19} And he said untoher, Give me, I pray thee, a little water to drink; for I am thirsty.And she opened a bottle of milk, and gave him drink, and covered him.

{4:20} Again he said unto her, Stand in the door of the tent, and itshall be, when any man doth come and enquire of thee, and say, Is thereany man here? that thou shalt say, No. 

{4:21} Then Jael Heber's wifetook a nail of the tent, and took an hammer in her hand, and wentsoftly unto him, and smote the nail into his temples, and fastened itinto the ground: for he was fast asleep and weary. So he died. 

{4:22}And, behold, as Barak pursued Sisera, Jael came out to meet him, andsaid unto him, Come, and I will shew thee the man whom thou seekest.And when he came into her [tent,] behold, Sisera lay dead, and the nail[was] in his temples. 

{4:23} So God subdued on that day Jabin the kingof Canaan before the children of Israel. 

{4:24} And the hand of thechildren of Israel prospered, and prevailed against Jabin the king ofCanaan, until they had destroyed Jabin king of Canaan.   

{5:1} Then sang Deborah and Barak the son of Abinoam on that day,saying, 

{5:2} Praise ye the LORD for the avenging of Israel, when thepeople willingly offered themselves. 

{5:3} Hear, O ye kings; give ear,O ye princes; I, [even] I, will sing unto the LORD; I will sing[praise] to the LORD God of Israel. 

{5:4} LORD, when thou wentest outof Seir, when thou marchedst out of the field of Edom, the earthtrembled, and the heavens dropped, the clouds also dropped water. 

{5:5}The mountains melted from before the LORD, [even] that Sinai frombefore the LORD God of Israel. 

{5:6} In the days of Shamgar the son ofAnath, in the days of Jael, the highways were unoccupied, and thetravelers walked through byways. 

{5:7} [The inhabitants of] thevillages ceased, they ceased in Israel, until that I Deborah arose,that I arose a mother in Israel. 

{5:8} They chose new gods; then [was]war in the gates: was there a shield or spear seen among forty thousandin Israel? 

{5:9} My heart [is] toward the governors of Israel, thatoffered themselves willingly among the people. Bless ye the LORD.

{5:10} Speak, ye that ride on white asses, ye that sit in judgment, andwalk by the way. 

{5:11} [They that are delivered] from the noise ofarchers in the places of drawing water, there shall they rehearse therighteous acts of the LORD, [even] the righteous acts [toward theinhabitants] of his villages in Israel: then shall the people of theLORD go down to the gates. 

{5:12} Awake, awake, Deborah: awake, awake,utter a song: arise, Barak, and lead thy captivity captive, thou son ofAbinoam. 

{5:13} Then he made him that remaineth have dominion over thenobles among the people: the LORD made me have dominion over themighty. 

{5:14} Out of Ephraim [was there] a root of them againstAmalek; after thee, Benjamin, among thy people; out of Machir came downgovernors, and out of Zebulun they that handle the pen of the writer.

{5:15} And the princes of Issachar [were] with Deborah; even Issachar,and also Barak: he was sent on foot into the valley. For the divisionsof Reuben [there were] great thoughts of heart. 

{5:16} Why abodest thouamong the sheepfolds, to hear the bleatings of the flocks? For thedivisions of Reuben [there were] great searchings of heart. 

{5:17}Gilead abode beyond Jordan: and why did Dan remain in ships? Ashercontinued on the sea shore, and abode in his breaches. 

{5:18} Zebulunand Naphtali [were] a people [that] jeoparded their lives unto thedeath in the high places of the field. 

{5:19} The kings came [and]fought, then fought the kings of Canaan in Taanach by the waters ofMegiddo; they took no gain of money. 

{5:20} They fought from heaven;the stars in their courses fought against Sisera. 

{5:21} The river ofKishon swept them away, that ancient river, the river Kishon. O mysoul, thou hast trodden down strength. 

{5:22} Then were the horsehoofsbroken by the means of the pransings, the pransings of their mightyones. 

{5:23} Curse ye Meroz, said the angel of the LORD, curse yebitterly the inhabitants thereof; because they came not to the help ofthe LORD, to the help of the LORD against the mighty. 

{5:24} Blessedabove women shall Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite be, blessed shallshe be above women in the tent. 

{5:25} He asked water, [and] she gave[him] milk; she brought forth butter in a lordly dish. 

{5:26} She puther hand to the nail, and her right hand to the workmen's hammer; andwith the hammer she smote Sisera, she smote off his head, when she hadpierced and stricken through his temples. 

{5:27} At her feet he bowed,he fell, he lay down: at her feet he bowed, he fell: where he bowed,there he fell down dead. 

{5:28} The mother of Sisera looked out at awindow, and cried through the lattice, Why is his chariot [so] long incoming? why tarry the wheels of his chariots? 

{5:29} Her wise ladiesanswered her, yea, she returned answer to herself, 

{5:30} Have they notsped? have they [not] divided the prey; to every man a damsel [or] two;to Sisera a prey of divers colours, a prey of divers colours ofneedlework, of divers colours of needlework on both sides, [meet] forthe necks of [them that take] the spoil? 

{5:31} So let all thineenemies perish, O LORD: but [let] them that love him [be] as the sunwhen he goeth forth in his might. And the land had rest forty years.   

{6:1} And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD:and the LORD delivered them into the hand of Midian seven years. 

{6:2}And the hand of Midian prevailed against Israel: [and] because of theMidianites the children of Israel made them the dens which [are] in themountains, and caves, and strong holds. 

{6:3} And [so] it was, whenIsrael had sown, that the Midianites came up, and the Amalekites, andthe children of the east, even they came up against them; 

{6:4} Andthey encamped against them, and destroyed the increase of the earth,till thou come unto Gaza, and left no sustenance for Israel, neithersheep, nor ox, nor ass. 

{6:5} For they came up with their cattle andtheir tents, and they came as grasshoppers for multitude; [for] boththey and their camels were without number: and they entered into theland to destroy it. 

{6:6} And Israel was greatly impoverished becauseof the Midianites; and the children of Israel cried unto the LORD.   

{6:7} And it came to pass, when the children of Israel cried untothe LORD because of the Midianites, 

{6:8} That the LORD sent a prophetunto the children of Israel, which said unto them, Thus saith the LORDGod of Israel, I brought you up from Egypt, and brought you forth outof the house of bondage; 

{6:9} And I delivered you out of the hand ofthe Egyptians, and out of the hand of all that oppressed you, and dravethem out from before you, and gave you their land; 

{6:10} And I saidunto you, I [am] the LORD your God; fear not the gods of the Amorites,in whose land ye dwell: but ye have not obeyed my voice.   

{6:11} And there came an angel of the LORD, and sat under an oakwhich [was] in Ophrah, that [pertained] unto Joash the Abi-ezrite: andhis son Gideon threshed wheat by the winepress, to hide [it] from theMidianites. 

{6:12} And the angel of the LORD appeared unto him, andsaid unto him, The LORD [is] with thee, thou mighty man of valour.

{6:13} And Gideon said unto him, Oh my Lord, if the LORD be with us,why then is all this befallen us? and where [be] all his miracles whichour fathers told us of, saying, Did not the LORD bring us up fromEgypt? but now the LORD hath forsaken us, and delivered us into thehands of the Midianites. 

{6:14} And the LORD looked upon him, and said,Go in this thy might, and thou shalt save Israel from the hand of theMidianites: have not I sent thee? 

{6:15} And he said unto him, Oh myLord, wherewith shall I save Israel? behold, my family is poor inManasseh, and I [am] the least in my father's house. 

{6:16} And theLORD said unto him, Surely I will be with thee, and thou shalt smitethe Midianites as one man. 

{6:17} And he said unto him, If now I havefound grace in thy sight, then shew me a sign that thou talkest withme. 

{6:18} Depart not hence, I pray thee, until I come unto thee, andbring forth my present, and set [it] before thee. And he said, I willtarry until thou come again.   

{6:19} And Gideon went in, and made ready a kid, and unleavenedcakes of an ephah of flour: the flesh he put in a basket, and he putthe broth in a pot, and brought [it] out unto him under the oak, andpresented [it. ]

{6:20} And the angel of God said unto him, Take theflesh and the unleavened cakes, and lay [them] upon this rock, and pourout the broth. And he did so.   

{6:21} Then the angel of the LORD put forth the end of the staffthat [was] in his hand, and touched the flesh and the unleavened cakes;and there rose up fire out of the rock, and consumed the flesh and theunleavened cakes. Then the angel of the LORD departed out of his sight.

{6:22} And when Gideon perceived that he [was] an angel of the LORD,Gideon said, Alas, O Lord GOD! for because I have seen an angel of theLORD face to face. 

{6:23} And the LORD said unto him, Peace [be] untothee; fear not: thou shalt not die. 

{6:24} Then Gideon built an altarthere unto the LORD, and called it Jehovah-shalom: unto this day it isyet in Ophrah of the Abi-ezrites.   

{6:25} And it came to pass the same night, that the LORD said untohim, Take thy father's young bullock, even the second bullock of sevenyears old, and throw down the altar of Baal that thy father hath, andcut down the grove that [is] by it: 

{6:26} And build an altar unto theLORD thy God upon the top of this rock, in the ordered place, and takethe second bullock, and offer a burnt sacrifice with the wood of thegrove which thou shalt cut down. 

{6:27} Then Gideon took ten men of hisservants, and did as the LORD had said unto him: and [so] it was,because he feared his father's household, and the men of the city, thathe could not do [it] by day, that he did [it] by night.   

{6:28} And when the men of the city arose early in the morning,behold, the altar of Baal was cast down, and the grove was cut downthat [was] by it, and the second bullock was offered upon the altar[that was] built. 

{6:29} And they said one to another, Who hath donethis thing? And when they enquired and asked, they said, Gideon the sonof Joash hath done this thing. 

{6:30} Then the men of the city saidunto Joash, Bring out thy son, that he may die: because he hath castdown the altar of Baal, and because he hath cut down the grove that[was] by it. 

{6:31} And Joash said unto all that stood against him,Will ye plead for Baal? will ye save him? he that will plead for him,let him be put to death whilst [it is yet] morning: if he [be] a god,let him plead for himself, because [one] hath cast down his altar.

{6:32} Therefore on that day he called him Jerubbaal, saying, Let Baalplead against him, because he hath thrown down his altar.   

{6:33} Then all the Midianites and the Amalekites and the childrenof the east were gathered together, and went over, and pitched in thevalley of Jezreel. 

{6:34} But the Spirit of the LORD came upon Gideon,and he blew a trumpet; and Abi-ezer was gathered after him. 

{6:35} Andhe sent messengers throughout all Manasseh; who also was gathered afterhim: and he sent messengers unto Asher, and unto Zebulun, and untoNaphtali; and they came up to meet them.   

{6:36} And Gideon said unto God, If thou wilt save Israel by minehand, as thou hast said, 

{6:37} Behold, I will put a fleece of wool inthe floor; [and] if the dew be on the fleece only, and [it be] dry uponall the earth [beside,] then shall I know that thou wilt save Israel bymine hand, as thou hast said. 

{6:38} And it was so: for he rose upearly on the morrow, and thrust the fleece together, and wringed thedew out of the fleece, a bowl full of water. 

{6:39} And Gideon saidunto God, Let not thine anger be hot against me, and I will speak butthis once: let me prove, I pray thee, but this once with the fleece;let it now be dry only upon the fleece, and upon all the ground letthere be dew. 

{6:40} And God did so that night: for it was dry upon thefleece only, and there was dew on all the ground.   

{7:1} Then Jerubbaal, who [is] Gideon, and all the people that[were] with him, rose up early, and pitched beside the well of Harod:so that the host of the Midianites were on the north side of them, bythe hill of Moreh, in the valley. 

{7:2} And the LORD said unto Gideon,The people that [are] with thee [are] too many for me to give theMidianites into their hands, lest Israel vaunt themselves against me,saying, Mine own hand hath saved me. 

{7:3} Now therefore go to,proclaim in the ears of the people, saying, Whosoever [is] fearful andafraid, let him return and depart early from mount Gilead. And therereturned of the people twenty and two thousand; and there remained tenthousand. 

{7:4} And the LORD said unto Gideon, The people [are] yet[too] many; bring them down unto the water, and I will try them forthee there: and it shall be, [that] of whom I say unto thee, This shallgo with thee, the same shall go with thee; and of whomsoever I say untothee, This shall not go with thee, the same shall not go. 

{7:5} So hebrought down the people unto the water: and the LORD said unto Gideon,Every one that lappeth of the water with his tongue, as a dog lappeth,him shalt thou set by himself; likewise every one that boweth down uponhis knees to drink. 

{7:6} And the number of them that lapped, [putting]their hand to their mouth, were three hundred men: but all the rest ofthe people bowed down upon their knees to drink water. 

{7:7} And theLORD said unto Gideon, By the three hundred men that lapped will I saveyou, and deliver the Midianites into thine hand: and let all the[other] people go every man unto his place. 

{7:8} So the people tookvictuals in their hand, and their trumpets: and he sent all [the restof] Israel every man unto his tent, and retained those three hundredmen: and the host of Midian was beneath him in the valley.   

{7:9} And it came to pass the same night, that the LORD said untohim, Arise, get thee down unto the host; for I have delivered it intothine hand. 

{7:10} But if thou fear to go down, go thou with Phurah thyservant down to the host: 

{7:11} And thou shalt hear what they say; andafterward shall thine hands be strengthened to go down unto the host.Then went he down with Phurah his servant unto the outside of the armedmen that [were] in the host. 

{7:12} And the Midianites and theAmalekites and all the children of the east lay along in the valleylike grasshoppers for multitude; and their camels [were] withoutnumber, as the sand by the sea side for multitude. 

{7:13} And whenGideon was come, behold, [there was] a man that told a dream unto hisfellow, and said, Behold, I dreamed a dream, and, lo, a cake of barleybread tumbled into the host of Midian, and came unto a tent, and smoteit that it fell, and overturned it, that the tent lay along. 

{7:14} Andhis fellow answered and said, This [is] nothing else save the sword ofGideon the son of Joash, a man of Israel: [for] into his hand hath Goddelivered Midian, and all the host.   

{7:15} And it was [so,] when Gideon heard the telling of the dream,and the interpretation thereof, that he worshipped, and returned intothe host of Israel, and said, Arise; for the LORD hath delivered intoyour hand the host of Midian. 

{7:16} And he divided the three hundredmen [into] three companies, and he put a trumpet in every man's hand,with empty pitchers, and lamps within the pitchers. 

{7:17} And he saidunto them, Look on me, and do likewise: and, behold, when I come to theoutside of the camp, it shall be [that,] as I do, so shall ye do.

{7:18} When I blow with a trumpet, I and all that [are] with me, thenblow ye the trumpets also on every side of all the camp, and say, [Thesword] of the LORD, and of Gideon.   

{7:19} So Gideon, and the hundred men that [were] with him, cameunto the outside of the camp in the beginning of the middle watch; andthey had but newly set the watch: and they blew the trumpets, and brakethe pitchers that [were] in their hands. 

{7:20} And the three companiesblew the trumpets, and brake the pitchers, and held the lamps in theirleft hands, and the trumpets in their right hands to blow [withal:] andthey cried, The sword of the LORD, and of Gideon. 

{7:21} And they stoodevery man in his place round about the camp: and all the host ran, andcried, and fled. 

{7:22} And the three hundred blew the trumpets, andthe LORD set every man's sword against his fellow, even throughout allthe host: and the host fled to Beth-shittah in Zererath, [and] to theborder of Abel- meholah, unto Tabbath. 

{7:23} And the men of Israelgathered themselves together out of Naphtali, and out of Asher, and outof all Manasseh, and pursued after the Midianites.   

{7:24} And Gideon sent messengers throughout all mount Ephraim,saying, Come down against the Midianites, and take before them thewaters unto Beth-barah and Jordan. Then all the men of Ephraim gatheredthemselves together, and took the waters unto Beth-barah and Jordan.

{7:25} And they took two princes of the Midianites, Oreb and Zeeb; andthey slew Oreb upon the rock Oreb, and Zeeb they slew at the winepressof Zeeb, and pursued Midian, and brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb toGideon on the other side Jordan.   

{8:1} And the men of Ephraim said unto him, Why hast thou served usthus, that thou calledst us not, when thou wentest to fight with theMidianites? And they did chide with him sharply. 

{8:2} And he said untothem, What have I done now in comparison of you? [Is] not the gleaningof the grapes of Ephraim better than the vintage of Abi-ezer? 

{8:3} Godhath delivered into your hands the princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb:and what was I able to do in comparison of you? Then their anger wasabated toward him, when he had said that.   

{8:4} And Gideon came to Jordan, [and] passed over, he, and thethree hundred men that [were] with him, faint, yet pursuing [them.]

{8:5} And he said unto the men of Succoth, Give, I pray you, loaves ofbread unto the people that follow me; for they [be] faint, and I ampursuing after Zebah and Zalmunna, kings of Midian.   

{8:6} And the princes of Succoth said, [Are] the hands of Zebah andZalmunna now in thine hand, that we should give bread unto thine army?

{8:7} And Gideon said, Therefore when the LORD hath delivered Zebah andZalmunna into mine hand, then I will tear your flesh with the thorns ofthe wilderness and with briers.   

{8:8} And he went up thence to Penuel, and spake unto them likewise:and the men of Penuel answered him as the men of Succoth had answered[him. ]

{8:9} And he spake also unto the men of Penuel, saying, When Icome again in peace, I will break down this tower.   

{8:10} Now Zebah and Zalmunna [were] in Karkor, and their hosts withthem, about fifteen thousand [men,] all that were left of all the hostsof the children of the east: for there fell an hundred and twentythousand men that drew sword.   

{8:11} And Gideon went up by the way of them that dwelt in tents onthe east of Nobah and Jogbehah, and smote the host: for the host wassecure. 

{8:12} And when Zebah and Zalmunna fled, he pursued after them,and took the two kings of Midian, Zebah and Zalmunna, and discomfitedall the host.   

{8:13} And Gideon the son of Joash returned from battle before thesun [was up, ]

{8:14} And caught a young man of the men of Succoth, andenquired of him: and he described unto him the princes of Succoth, andthe elders thereof, [even] threescore and seventeen men. 

{8:15} And hecame unto the men of Succoth, and said, Behold Zebah and Zalmunna, withwhom ye did upbraid me, saying, [Are] the hands of Zebah and Zalmunnanow in thine hand, that we should give bread unto thy men [that are]weary? 

{8:16} And he took the elders of the city, and thorns of thewilderness and briers, and with them he taught the men of Succoth.

{8:17} And he beat down the tower of Penuel, and slew the men of thecity.   

{8:18} Then said he unto Zebah and Zalmunna, What manner of men[were they] whom ye slew at Tabor? And they answered, As thou [art,] so[were] they; each one resembled the children of a king. 

{8:19} And hesaid, They [were] my brethren, [even] the sons of my mother: [as] theLORD liveth, if ye had saved them alive, I would not slay you. 

{8:20}And he said unto Jether his firstborn, Up, [and] slay them. But theyouth drew not his sword: for he feared, because he [was] yet a youth.

{8:21} Then Zebah and Zalmunna said, Rise thou, and fall upon us: foras the man [is, so is] his strength. And Gideon arose, and slew Zebahand Zalmunna, and took away the ornaments that [were] on their camels'necks.   

{8:22} Then the men of Israel said unto Gideon, Rule thou over us,both thou, and thy son, and thy son's son also: for thou hast deliveredus from the hand of Midian. 

{8:23} And Gideon said unto them, I willnot rule over you, neither shall my son rule over you: the LORD shallrule over you.   

{8:24} And Gideon said unto them, I would desire a request of you,that ye would give me every man the earrings of his prey. (For they hadgolden earrings, because they [were] Ishmaelites.) 

{8:25} And theyanswered, We will willingly give [them.] And they spread a garment, anddid cast therein every man the earrings of his prey. 

{8:26} And theweight of the golden earrings that he requested was a thousand andseven hundred [shekels] of gold; beside ornaments, and collars, andpurple raiment that [was] on the kings of Midian, and beside the chainsthat [were] about their camels' necks. 

{8:27} And Gideon made an ephodthereof, and put it in his city, [even] in Ophrah: and all Israel wentthither a whoring after it: which thing became a snare unto Gideon, andto his house.   

{8:28} Thus was Midian subdued before the children of Israel, sothat they lifted up their heads no more. And the country was inquietness forty years in the days of Gideon.   

{8:29} And Jerubbaal the son of Joash went and dwelt in his ownhouse. 

{8:30} And Gideon had threescore and ten sons of his bodybegotten: for he had many wives. 

{8:31} And his concubine that [was] inShechem, she also bare him a son, whose name he called Abimelech.   

{8:32} And Gideon the son of Joash died in a good old age, and wasburied in the sepulchre of Joash his father, in Ophrah of theAbi-ezrites. 

{8:33} And it came to pass, as soon as Gideon was dead,that the children of Israel turned again, and went a whoring afterBaalim, and made Baal-berith their god. 

{8:34} And the children ofIsrael remembered not the LORD their God, who had delivered them out ofthe hands of all their enemies on every side: 

{8:35} Neither shewedthey kindness to the house of Jerubbaal, [namely,] Gideon, according toall the goodness which he had shewed unto Israel.   

{9:1} And Abimelech the son of Jerubbaal went to Shechem unto hismother's brethren, and communed with them, and with all the family ofthe house of his mother's father, saying, 

{9:2} Speak, I pray you, inthe ears of all the men of Shechem, Whether is better for you, eitherthat all the sons of Jerubbaal, [which are] threescore and ten persons,reign over you, or that one reign over you? remember also that I [am]your bone and your flesh. 

{9:3} And his mother's brethren spake of himin the ears of all the men of Shechem all these words: and their heartsinclined to follow Abimelech; for they said, He [is] our brother. 

{9:4}And they gave him threescore and ten [pieces] of silver out of thehouse of Baal-berith, wherewith Abimelech hired vain and light persons,which followed him. 

{9:5} And he went unto his father's house atOphrah, and slew his brethren the sons of Jerubbaal, [being] threescoreand ten persons, upon one stone: notwithstanding yet Jotham theyoungest son of Jerubbaal was left; for he hid himself. 

{9:6} And allthe men of Shechem gathered together, and all the house of Millo, andwent, and made Abimelech king, by the plain of the pillar that [was] inShechem.   

{9:7} And when they told [it] to Jotham, he went and stood in thetop of mount Gerizim, and lifted up his voice, and cried, and said untothem, Hearken unto me, ye men of Shechem, that God may hearken untoyou. 

{9:8} The trees went forth [on a time] to anoint a king over them;and they said unto the olive tree, Reign thou over us. 

{9:9} But theolive tree said unto them, Should I leave my fatness, wherewith by methey honour God and man, and go to be promoted over the trees? 

{9:10}And the trees said to the fig tree, Come thou, [and] reign over us.

{9:11} But the fig tree said unto them, Should I forsake my sweetness,and my good fruit, and go to be promoted over the trees? 

{9:12} Thensaid the trees unto the vine, Come thou, [and] reign over us. 

{9:13}And the vine said unto them, Should I leave my wine, which cheereth Godand man, and go to be promoted over the trees? 

{9:14} Then said all thetrees unto the bramble, Come thou, [and] reign over us. 

{9:15} And thebramble said unto the trees, If in truth ye anoint me king over you,[then] come [and] put your trust in my shadow: and if not, let firecome out of the bramble, and devour the cedars of Lebanon. 

{9:16} Nowtherefore, if ye have done truly and sincerely, in that ye have madeAbimelech king, and if ye have dealt well with Jerubbaal and his house,and have done unto him according to the deserving of his hands; 

{9:17}(For my father fought for you, and adventured his life far, anddelivered you out of the hand of Midian: 

{9:18} And ye are risen upagainst my father's house this day, and have slain his sons, threescoreand ten persons, upon one stone, and have made Abimelech, the son ofhis maidservant, king over the men of Shechem, because he [is] yourbrother;) 

{9:19} If ye then have dealt truly and sincerely withJerubbaal and with his house this day, [then] rejoice ye in Abimelech,and let him also rejoice in you: 

{9:20} But if not, let fire come outfrom Abimelech, and devour the men of Shechem, and the house of Millo;and let fire come out from the men of Shechem, and from the house ofMillo, and devour Abimelech. 

{9:21} And Jotham ran away, and fled, andwent to Beer, and dwelt there, for fear of Abimelech his brother.   

{9:22} When Abimelech had reigned three years over Israel, 

{9:23}Then God sent an evil spirit between Abimelech and the men of Shechem;and the men of Shechem dealt treacherously with Abimelech: 

{9:24} Thatthe cruelty [done] to the threescore and ten sons of Jerubbaal mightcome, and their blood be laid upon Abimelech their brother, which slewthem; and upon the men of Shechem, which aided him in the killing ofhis brethren. 

{9:25} And the men of Shechem set liers in wait for himin the top of the mountains, and they robbed all that came along thatway by them: and it was told Abimelech. 

{9:26} And Gaal the son of Ebedcame with his brethren, and went over to Shechem: and the men ofShechem put their confidence in him. 

{9:27} And they went out into thefields, and gathered their vineyards, and trode [the grapes,] and mademerry, and went into the house of their god, and did eat and drink, andcursed Abimelech. 

{9:28} And Gaal the son of Ebed said, Who [is]Abimelech, and who [is] Shechem, that we should serve him? [is] not[he] the son of Jerubbaal? and Zebul his officer? serve the men ofHamor the father of Shechem: for why should we serve him? 

{9:29} Andwould to God this people were under my hand! then would I removeAbimelech. And he said to Abimelech, Increase thine army, and come out.   

{9:30} And when Zebul the ruler of the city heard the words of Gaalthe son of Ebed, his anger was kindled. 

{9:31} And he sent messengersunto Abimelech privily, saying, Behold, Gaal the son of Ebed and hisbrethren be come to Shechem; and, behold, they fortify the city againstthee. 

{9:32} Now therefore up by night, thou and the people that [is]with thee, and lie in wait in the field: 

{9:33} And it shall be, [that]in the morning, as soon as the sun is up, thou shalt rise early, andset upon the city: and, behold, [when] he and the people that [is] withhim come out against thee, then mayest thou do to them as thou shaltfind occasion.   

{9:34} And Abimelech rose up, and all the people that [were] withhim, by night, and they laid wait against Shechem in four companies.

{9:35} And Gaal the son of Ebed went out, and stood in the entering ofthe gate of the city: and Abimelech rose up, and the people that [were]with him, from lying in wait. 

{9:36} And when Gaal saw the people, hesaid to Zebul, Behold, there come people down from the top of themountains. And Zebul said unto him, Thou seest the shadow of themountains as [if they were] men. 

{9:37} And Gaal spake again and said,See there come people down by the middle of the land, and anothercompany come along by the plain of Meonenim. 

{9:38} Then said Zebulunto him, Where [is] now thy mouth, wherewith thou saidst, Who [is]Abimelech, that we should serve him? [is] not this the people that thouhast despised? go out, I pray now, and fight with them. 

{9:39} And Gaalwent out before the men of Shechem, and fought with Abimelech. 

{9:40}And Abimelech chased him, and he fled before him, and many wereoverthrown [and] wounded, [even] unto the entering of the gate. 

{9:41}And Abimelech dwelt at Arumah: and Zebul thrust out Gaal and hisbrethren, that they should not dwell in Shechem. 

{9:42} And it came topass on the morrow, that the people went out into the field; and theytold Abimelech. 

{9:43} And he took the people, and divided them intothree companies, and laid wait in the field, and looked, and, behold,the people [were] come forth out of the city; and he rose up againstthem, and smote them. 

{9:44} And Abimelech, and the company that [was]with him, rushed forward, and stood in the entering of the gate of thecity: and the two [other] companies ran upon all [the people] that[were] in the fields, and slew them. 

{9:45} And Abimelech foughtagainst the city all that day; and he took the city, and slew thepeople that [was] therein, and beat down the city, and sowed it withsalt.   

{9:46} And when all the men of the tower of Shechem heard [that,]they entered into an hold of the house of the god Berith. 

{9:47} And itwas told Abimelech, that all the men of the tower of Shechem weregathered together. 

{9:48} And Abimelech gat him up to mount Zalmon, heand all the people that [were] with him; and Abimelech took an axe inhis hand, and cut down a bough from the trees, and took it, and laid[it] on his shoulder, and said unto the people that [were] with him,What ye have seen me do, make haste, [and] do as I [have done. ]

{9:49}And all the people likewise cut down every man his bough, and followedAbimelech, and put [them] to the hold, and set the hold on fire uponthem; so that all the men of the tower of Shechem died also, about athousand men and women.   

{9:50} Then went Abimelech to Thebez, and encamped against Thebez,and took it. 

{9:51} But there was a strong tower within the city, andthither fled all the men and women, and all they of the city, and shut[it] to them, and gat them up to the top of the tower. 

{9:52} AndAbimelech came unto the tower, and fought against it, and went hardunto the door of the tower to burn it with fire. 

{9:53} And a certainwoman cast a piece of a millstone upon Abimelech's head, and all tobrake his skull. 

{9:54} Then he called hastily unto the young man hisarmourbearer, and said unto him, Draw thy sword, and slay me, that mensay not of me, A woman slew him. And his young man thrust him through,and he died. 

{9:55} And when the men of Israel saw that Abimelech wasdead, they departed every man unto his place.   

{9:56} Thus God rendered the wickedness of Abimelech, which he didunto his father, in slaying his seventy brethren: 

{9:57} And all theevil of the men of Shechem did God render upon their heads: and uponthem came the curse of Jotham the son of Jerubbaal.   

{10:1} And after Abimelech there arose to defend Israel Tola the sonof Puah, the son of Dodo, a man of Issachar; and he dwelt in Shamir inmount Ephraim. 

{10:2} And he judged Israel twenty and three years, anddied, and was buried in Shamir.   

{10:3} And after him arose Jair, a Gileadite, and judged Israeltwenty and two years. 

{10:4} And he had thirty sons that rode on thirtyass colts, and they had thirty cities, which are called Havoth-jairunto this day, which [are] in the land of Gilead. 

{10:5} And Jair died,and was buried in Camon.   

{10:6} And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of theLORD, and served Baalim, and Ashtaroth, and the gods of Syria, and thegods of Zidon, and the gods of Moab, and the gods of the children ofAmmon, and the gods of the Philistines, and forsook the LORD, andserved not him. 

{10:7} And the anger of the LORD was hot againstIsrael, and he sold them into the hands of the Philistines, and intothe hands of the children of Ammon. 

{10:8} And that year they vexed andoppressed the children of Israel: eighteen years, all the children ofIsrael that [were] on the other side Jordan in the land of theAmorites, which [is] in Gilead. 

{10:9} Moreover the children of Ammonpassed over Jordan to fight also against Judah, and against Benjamin,and against the house of Ephraim; so that Israel was sore distressed.   

{10:10} And the children of Israel cried unto the LORD, saying, Wehave sinned against thee, both because we have forsaken our God, andalso served Baalim. 

{10:11} And the LORD said unto the children ofIsrael, [Did] not [I deliver you] from the Egyptians, and from theAmorites, from the children of Ammon, and from the Philistines? 

{10:12}The Zidonians also, and the Amalekites, and the Maonites, did oppressyou; and ye cried to me, and I delivered you out of their hand. 

{10:13}Yet ye have forsaken me, and served other gods: wherefore I willdeliver you no more. 

{10:14} Go and cry unto the gods which ye havechosen; let them deliver you in the time of your tribulation.   

{10:15} And the children of Israel said unto the LORD, We havesinned: do thou unto us whatsoever seemeth good unto thee; deliver usonly, we pray thee, this day. 

{10:16} And they put away the strangegods from among them, and served the LORD: and his soul was grieved forthe misery of Israel. 

{10:17} Then the children of Ammon were gatheredtogether, and encamped in Gilead. And the children of Israel assembledthemselves together, and encamped in Mizpeh. 

{10:18} And the people[and] princes of Gilead said one to another, What man [is he] that willbegin to fight against the children of Ammon? he shall be head over allthe inhabitants of Gilead.   

{11:1} Now Jephthah the Gileadite was a mighty man of valour, and he[was] the son of an harlot: and Gilead begat Jephthah. 

{11:2} AndGilead's wife bare him sons; and his wife's sons grew up, and theythrust out Jephthah, and said unto him, Thou shalt not inherit in ourfather's house; for thou [art] the son of a strange woman. 

{11:3} ThenJephthah fled from his brethren, and dwelt in the land of Tob: andthere were gathered vain men to Jephthah, and went out with him.   

{11:4} And it came to pass in process of time, that the children ofAmmon made war against Israel. 

{11:5} And it was so, that when thechildren of Ammon made war against Israel, the elders of Gilead went tofetch Jephthah out of the land of Tob: 

{11:6} And they said untoJephthah, Come, and be our captain, that we may fight with the childrenof Ammon. 

{11:7} And Jephthah said unto the elders of Gilead, Did notye hate me, and expel me out of my father's house? and why are ye comeunto me now when ye are in distress? 

{11:8} And the elders of Gileadsaid unto Jephthah, Therefore we turn again to thee now, that thoumayest go with us, and fight against the children of Ammon, and be ourhead over all the inhabitants of Gilead. 

{11:9} And Jephthah said untothe elders of Gilead, If ye bring me home again to fight against thechildren of Ammon, and the LORD deliver them before me, shall I be yourhead? 

{11:10} And the elders of Gilead said unto Jephthah, The LORD bewitness between us, if we do not so according to thy words. 

{11:11}Then Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead, and the people made himhead and captain over them: and Jephthah uttered all his words beforethe LORD in Mizpeh.   

{11:12} And Jephthah sent messengers unto the king of the childrenof Ammon, saying, What hast thou to do with me, that thou art comeagainst me to fight in my land? 

{11:13} And the king of the children ofAmmon answered unto the messengers of Jephthah, Because Israel tookaway my land, when they came up out of Egypt, from Arnon even untoJabbok, and unto Jordan: now therefore restore those [lands] againpeaceably. 

{11:14} And Jephthah sent messengers again unto the king ofthe children of Ammon: 

{11:15} And said unto him, Thus saith Jephthah,Israel took not away the land of Moab, nor the land of the children ofAmmon: 

{11:16} But when Israel came up from Egypt, and walked throughthe wilderness unto the Red sea, and came to Kadesh; 

{11:17} ThenIsrael sent messengers unto the king of Edom, saying, Let me, I praythee, pass through thy land: but the king of Edom would not hearken[thereto.] And in like manner they sent unto the king of Moab: but hewould not [consent:] and Israel abode in Kadesh. 

{11:18} Then they wentalong through the wilderness, and compassed the land of Edom, and theland of Moab, and came by the east side of the land of Moab, andpitched on the other side of Arnon, but came not within the border ofMoab: for Arnon [was] the border of Moab. 

{11:19} And Israel sentmessengers unto Sihon king of the Amorites, the king of Heshbon; andIsrael said unto him, Let us pass, we pray thee, through thy land intomy place. 

{11:20} But Sihon trusted not Israel to pass through hiscoast: but Sihon gathered all his people together, and pitched inJahaz, and fought against Israel. 

{11:21} And the LORD God of Israeldelivered Sihon and all his people into the hand of Israel, and theysmote them: so Israel possessed all the land of the Amorites, theinhabitants of that country. 

{11:22} And they possessed all the coastsof the Amorites, from Arnon even unto Jabbok, and from the wildernesseven unto Jordan. 

{11:23} So now the LORD God of Israel hathdispossessed the Amorites from before his people Israel, and shouldestthou possess it? 

{11:24} Wilt not thou possess that which Chemosh thygod giveth thee to possess? So whomsoever the LORD our God shall driveout from before us, them will we possess. 

{11:25} And now [art] thouany thing better than Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab? did heever strive against Israel, or did he ever fight against them, 

{11:26}While Israel dwelt in Heshbon and her towns, and in Aroer and hertowns, and in all the cities that [be] along by the coasts of Arnon,three hundred years? why therefore did ye not recover [them] withinthat time? 

{11:27} Wherefore I have not sinned against thee, but thoudoest me wrong to war against me: the LORD the Judge be judge this daybetween the children of Israel and the children of Ammon. 

{11:28}Howbeit the king of the children of Ammon hearkened not unto the wordsof Jephthah which he sent him.   

{11:29} Then the Spirit of the LORD came upon Jephthah, and hepassed over Gilead, and Manasseh, and passed over Mizpeh of Gilead, andfrom Mizpeh of Gilead he passed over [unto] the children of Ammon.

{11:30} And Jephthah vowed a vow unto the LORD, and said, If thou shaltwithout fail deliver the children of Ammon into mine hands, 

{11:31}Then it shall be, that whatsoever cometh forth of the doors of my houseto meet me, when I return in peace from the children of Ammon, shallsurely be the LORD'S, and I will offer it up for a burnt offering.   

{11:32} So Jephthah passed over unto the children of Ammon to fightagainst them; and the LORD delivered them into his hands. 

{11:33} Andhe smote them from Aroer, even till thou come to Minnith, [even] twentycities, and unto the plain of the vineyards, with a very greatslaughter. Thus the children of Ammon were subdued before the childrenof Israel.   

{11:34} And Jephthah came to Mizpeh unto his house, and, behold, hisdaughter came out to meet him with timbrels and with dances: and she[was his] only child; beside her he had neither son nor daughter.

{11:35} And it came to pass, when he saw her, that he rent his clothes,and said, Alas, my daughter! thou hast brought me very low, and thouart one of them that trouble me: for I have opened my mouth unto theLORD, and I cannot go back. 

{11:36} And she said unto him, My father,[if] thou hast opened thy mouth unto the LORD, do to me according tothat which hath proceeded out of thy mouth; forasmuch as the LORD hathtaken vengeance for thee of thine enemies, [even] of the children ofAmmon. 

{11:37} And she said unto her father, Let this thing be done forme: let me alone two months, that I may go up and down upon themountains, and bewail my virginity, I and my fellows. 

{11:38} And hesaid, Go. And he sent her away [for] two months: and she went with hercompanions, and bewailed her virginity upon the mountains. 

{11:39} Andit came to pass at the end of two months, that she returned unto herfather, who did with her [according] to his vow which he had vowed: andshe knew no man. And it was a custom in Israel, 

{11:40} [That] thedaughters of Israel went yearly to lament the daughter of Jephthah theGileadite four days in a year.   

{12:1} And the men of Ephraim gathered themselves together, and wentnorthward, and said unto Jephthah, Wherefore passedst thou over tofight against the children of Ammon, and didst not call us to go withthee? we will burn thine house upon thee with fire. 

{12:2} And Jephthahsaid unto them, I and my people were at great strife with the childrenof Ammon; and when I called you, ye delivered me not out of theirhands. 

{12:3} And when I saw that ye delivered [me] not, I put my lifein my hands, and passed over against the children of Ammon, and theLORD delivered them into my hand: wherefore then are ye come up unto methis day, to fight against me? 

{12:4} Then Jephthah gathered togetherall the men of Gilead, and fought with Ephraim: and the men of Gileadsmote Ephraim, because they said, Ye Gileadites [are] fugitives ofEphraim among the Ephraimites, [and] among the Manassites. 

{12:5} Andthe Gileadites took the passages of Jordan before the Ephraimites: andit was [so,] that when those Ephraimites which were escaped said, Letme go over; that the men of Gilead said unto him, [Art] thou anEphraimite? If he said, Nay; 

{12:6} Then said they unto him, Say nowShibboleth: and he said Sibboleth: for he could not frame to pronounce[it] right. Then they took him, and slew him at the passages of Jordan:and there fell at that time of the Ephraimites forty and two thousand.

{12:7} And Jephthah judged Israel six years. Then died Jephthah theGileadite, and was buried in [one of] the cities of Gilead.   

{12:8} And after him Ibzan of Bethlehem judged Israel. 

{12:9} And hehad thirty sons, and thirty daughters, [whom] he sent abroad, and tookin thirty daughters from abroad for his sons. And he judged Israelseven years. 

{12:10} Then died Ibzan, and was buried at Bethlehem.   

{12:11} And after him Elon, a Zebulonite, judged Israel; and hejudged Israel ten years. 

{12:12} And Elon the Zebulonite died, and wasburied in Aijalon in the country of Zebulun.   

{12:13} And after him Abdon the son of Hillel, a Pirathonite, judgedIsrael. 

{12:14} And he had forty sons and thirty nephews, that rode onthreescore and ten ass colts: and he judged Israel eight years. 

{12:15}And Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite died, and was buried inPirathon in the land of Ephraim, in the mount of the Amalekites.   

{13:1} And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of theLORD; and the LORD delivered them into the hand of the Philistinesforty years.   

{13:2} And there was a certain man of Zorah, of the family of theDanites, whose name [was] Manoah; and his wife [was] barren, and barenot. 

{13:3} And the angel of the LORD appeared unto the woman, and saidunto her, Behold now, thou [art] barren, and bearest not: but thoushalt conceive, and bear a son. 

{13:4} Now therefore beware, I praythee, and drink not wine nor strong drink, and eat not any unclean[thing: ]

{13:5} For, lo, thou shalt conceive, and bear a son; and norazor shall come on his head: for the child shall be a Nazarite untoGod from the womb: and he shall begin to deliver Israel out of the handof the Philistines.   

{13:6} Then the woman came and told her husband, saying, A man ofGod came unto me, and his countenance [was] like the countenance of anangel of God, very terrible: but I asked him not whence he [was,]neither told he me his name: 

{13:7} But he said unto me, Behold, thoushalt conceive, and bear a son; and now drink no wine nor strong drink,neither eat any unclean [thing:] for the child shall be a Nazarite toGod from the womb to the day of his death.   

{13:8} Then Manoah intreated the LORD, and said, O my Lord, let theman of God which thou didst send come again unto us, and teach us whatwe shall do unto the child that shall be born. 

{13:9} And God hearkenedto the voice of Manoah; and the angel of God came again unto the womanas she sat in the field: but Manoah her husband [was] not with her.

{13:10} And the woman made haste, and ran, and shewed her husband, andsaid unto him, Behold, the man hath appeared unto me, that came unto methe [other] day. 

{13:11} And Manoah arose, and went after his wife, andcame to the man, and said unto him, Art thou the man that spakest untothe woman? And he said, I [am. ]

{13:12} And Manoah said, Now let thywords come to pass. How shall we order the child, and [how] shall we dounto him? 

{13:13} And the angel of the LORD said unto Manoah, Of allthat I said unto the woman let her beware. 

{13:14} She may not eat ofany [thing] that cometh of the vine, neither let her drink wine orstrong drink, nor eat any unclean [thing:] all that I commanded her lether observe.   

{13:15} And Manoah said unto the angel of the LORD, I pray thee, letus detain thee, until we shall have made ready a kid for thee. 

{13:16}And the angel of the LORD said unto Manoah, Though thou detain me, Iwill not eat of thy bread: and if thou wilt offer a burnt offering,thou must offer it unto the LORD. For Manoah knew not that he [was] anangel of the LORD. 

{13:17} And Manoah said unto the angel of the LORD,What [is] thy name, that when thy sayings come to pass we may do theehonour? 

{13:18} And the angel of the LORD said unto him, Why askestthou thus after my name, seeing it is secret? 

{13:19} So Manoah took akid with a meat offering, and offered [it] upon a rock unto the LORD:and [the angel] did wonderously; and Manoah and his wife looked on.

{13:20} For it came to pass, when the flame went up toward heaven fromoff the altar, that the angel of the LORD ascended in the flame of thealtar. And Manoah and his wife looked on [it,] and fell on their facesto the ground. 

{13:21} But the angel of the LORD did no more appear toManoah and to his wife. Then Manoah knew that he [was] an angel of theLORD. 

{13:22} And Manoah said unto his wife, We shall surely die,because we have seen God. 

{13:23} But his wife said unto him, If theLORD were pleased to kill us, he would not have received a burntoffering and a meat offering at our hands, neither would he have shewedus all these [things,] nor would as at this time have told us [suchthings] as these.   

{13:24} And the woman bare a son, and called his name Samson: andthe child grew, and the LORD blessed him. 

{13:25} And the Spirit of theLORD began to move him at times in the camp of Dan between Zorah andEshtaol.   

{14:1} And Samson went down to Timnath, and saw a woman in Timnathof the daughters of the Philistines. 

{14:2} And he came up, and toldhis father and his mother, and said, I have seen a woman in Timnath ofthe daughters of the Philistines: now therefore get her for me to wife.

{14:3} Then his father and his mother said unto him, [Is there] never awoman among the daughters of thy brethren, or among all my people, thatthou goest to take a wife of the uncircumcised Philistines? And Samsonsaid unto his father, Get her for me; for she pleaseth me well. 

{14:4}But his father and his mother knew not that it [was] of the LORD, thathe sought an occasion against the Philistines: for at that time thePhilistines had dominion over Israel.   

{14:5} Then went Samson down, and his father and his mother, toTimnath, and came to the vineyards of Timnath: and, behold, a younglion roared against him. 

{14:6} And the Spirit of the LORD camemightily upon him, and he rent him as he would have rent a kid, and [hehad] nothing in his hand: but he told not his father or his mother whathe had done. 

{14:7} And he went down, and talked with the woman; andshe pleased Samson well.   

{14:8} And after a time he returned to take her, and he turned asideto see the carcase of the lion: and, behold, [there was] a swarm ofbees and honey in the carcase of the lion. 

{14:9} And he took thereofin his hands, and went on eating, and came to his father and mother,and he gave them, and they did eat: but he told not them that he hadtaken the honey out of the carcase of the lion.   

{14:10} So his father went down unto the woman: and Samson madethere a feast; for so used the young men to do. 

{14:11} And it came topass, when they saw him, that they brought thirty companions to be withhim.   

{14:12} And Samson said unto them, I will now put forth a riddleunto you: if ye can certainly declare it me within the seven days ofthe feast, and find [it] out, then I will give you thirty sheets andthirty change of garments: 

{14:13} But if ye cannot declare [it] me,then shall ye give me thirty sheets and thirty change of garments. Andthey said unto him, Put forth thy riddle, that we may hear it. 

{14:14}And he said unto them, Out of the eater came forth meat, and out of thestrong came forth sweetness. And they could not in three days expoundthe riddle. 

{14:15} And it came to pass on the seventh day, that theysaid unto Samson's wife, Entice thy husband, that he may declare untous the riddle, lest we burn thee and thy father's house with fire: haveye called us to take that we have? [is it] not [so? ]

{14:16} AndSamson's wife wept before him, and said, Thou dost but hate me, andlovest me not: thou hast put forth a riddle unto the children of mypeople, and hast not told [it] me. And he said unto her, Behold, I havenot told [it] my father nor my mother, and shall I tell [it] thee?

{14:17} And she wept before him the seven days, while their feastlasted: and it came to pass on the seventh day, that he told her,because she lay sore upon him: and she told the riddle to the childrenof her people. 

{14:18} And the men of the city said unto him on theseventh day before the sun went down, What [is] sweeter than honey? andwhat [is] stronger than a lion? And he said unto them, If ye had notplowed with my heifer, ye had not found out my riddle.   

{14:19} And the Spirit of the LORD came upon him, and he went downto Ashkelon, and slew thirty men of them, and took their spoil, andgave change of garments unto them which expounded the riddle. And hisanger was kindled, and he went up to his father's house. 

{14:20} ButSamson's wife was [given] to his companion, whom he had used as hisfriend.   

{15:1} But it came to pass within a while after, in the time ofwheat harvest, that Samson visited his wife with a kid; and he said, Iwill go in to my wife into the chamber. But her father would not sufferhim to go in. 

{15:2} And her father said, I verily thought that thouhadst utterly hated her; therefore I gave her to thy companion: [is]not her younger sister fairer than she? take her, I pray thee, insteadof her.   

{15:3} And Samson said concerning them, Now shall I be moreblameless than the Philistines, though I do them a displeasure. 

{15:4}And Samson went and caught three hundred foxes, and took firebrands,and turned tail to tail, and put a firebrand in the midst between twotails. 

{15:5} And when he had set the brands on fire, he [let] them gointo the standing corn of the Philistines, and burnt up both theshocks, and also the standing corn, with the vineyards [and] olives.   

{15:6} Then the Philistines said, Who hath done this? And theyanswered, Samson, the son in law of the Timnite, because he had takenhis wife, and given her to his companion. And the Philistines came up,and burnt her and her father with fire.   

{15:7} And Samson said unto them, Though ye have done this, yet willI be avenged of you, and after that I will cease. 

{15:8} And he smotethem hip and thigh with a great slaughter: and he went down and dweltin the top of the rock Etam.   

{15:9} Then the Philistines went up, and pitched in Judah, andspread themselves in Lehi. 

{15:10} And the men of Judah said, Why areye come up against us? And they answered, To bind Samson are we comeup, to do to him as he hath done to us. 

{15:11} Then three thousand menof Judah went to the top of the rock Etam, and said to Samson, Knowestthou not that the Philistines [are] rulers over us? what [is] this[that] thou hast done unto us? And he said unto them, As they did untome, so have I done unto them. 

{15:12} And they said unto him, We arecome down to bind thee, that we may deliver thee into the hand of thePhilistines. And Samson said unto them, Swear unto me, that ye will notfall upon me yourselves. 

{15:13} And they spake unto him, saying, No;but we will bind thee fast, and deliver thee into their hand: butsurely we will not kill thee. And they bound him with two new cords,and brought him up from the rock.   

{15:14} [And] when he came unto Lehi, the Philistines shoutedagainst him: and the Spirit of the LORD came mightily upon him, and thecords that [were] upon his arms became as flax that was burnt withfire, and his bands loosed from off his hands. 

{15:15} And he found anew jawbone of an ass, and put forth his hand, and took it, and slew athousand men therewith. 

{15:16} And Samson said, With the jawbone of anass, heaps upon heaps, with the jaw of an ass have I slain a thousandmen. 

{15:17} And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking,that he cast away the jawbone out of his hand, and called that placeRamath-lehi.   

{15:18} And he was sore athirst, and called on the LORD, and said,Thou hast given this great deliverance into the hand of thy servant:and now shall I die for thirst, and fall into the hand of theuncircumcised? 

{15:19} But God clave an hollow place that [was] in thejaw, and there came water thereout; and when he had drunk, his spiritcame again, and he revived: wherefore he called the name thereofEn-hakkore, which [is] in Lehi unto this day. 

{15:20} And he judgedIsrael in the days of the Philistines twenty years.   

{16:1} Then went Samson to Gaza, and saw there an harlot, and wentin unto her. 

{16:2} [And it was told] the Gazites, saying, Samson iscome hither. And they compassed [him] in, and laid wait for him allnight in the gate of the city, and were quiet all the night, saying, Inthe morning, when it is day, we shall kill him. 

{16:3} And Samson laytill midnight, and arose at midnight, and took the doors of the gate ofthe city, and the two posts, and went away with them, bar and all, andput [them] upon his shoulders, and carried them up to the top of anhill that is before Hebron.   

{16:4} And it came to pass afterward, that he loved a woman in thevalley of Sorek, whose name [was] Delilah. 

{16:5} And the lords of thePhilistines came up unto her, and said unto her, Entice him, and seewherein his great strength [lieth,] and by what [means] we may prevailagainst him, that we may bind him to afflict him: and we will give theeevery one of us eleven hundred [pieces] of silver.   

{16:6} And Delilah said to Samson, Tell me, I pray thee, wherein thygreat strength [lieth,] and wherewith thou mightest be bound to afflictthee. 

{16:7} And Samson said unto her, If they bind me with seven greenwiths that were never dried, then shall I be weak, and be as anotherman. 

{16:8} Then the lords of the Philistines brought up to her sevengreen withs which had not been dried, and she bound him with them.

{16:9} Now [there were] men lying in wait, abiding with her in thechamber. And she said unto him, The Philistines [be] upon thee, Samson.And he brake the withs, as a thread of tow is broken when it toucheththe fire. So his strength was not known. 

{16:10} And Delilah said untoSamson, Behold, thou hast mocked me, and told me lies: now tell me, Ipray thee, wherewith thou mightest be bound. 

{16:11} And he said untoher, If they bind me fast with new ropes that never were occupied, thenshall I be weak, and be as another man. 

{16:12} Delilah therefore tooknew ropes, and bound him therewith, and said unto him, The Philistinesbe upon thee, Samson. And [there were] liers in wait abiding in thechamber. And he brake them from off his arms like a thread. 

{16:13} AndDelilah said unto Samson, Hitherto thou hast mocked me, and told melies: tell me wherewith thou mightest be bound. And he said unto her,If thou weavest the seven locks of my head with the web. 

{16:14} Andshe fastened [it] with the pin, and said unto him, The Philistines [be]upon thee, Samson. And he awaked out of his sleep, and went away withthe pin of the beam, and with the web.   

{16:15} And she said unto him, How canst thou say, I love thee, whenthine heart [is] not with me? thou hast mocked me these three times,and hast not told me wherein thy great strength [lieth. ]

{16:16} And itcame to pass, when she pressed him daily with her words, and urged him,[so] that his soul was vexed unto death; 

{16:17} That he told her allhis heart, and said unto her. There hath not come a razor upon minehead; for I [have been] a Nazarite unto God from my mother's womb: if Ibe shaven, then my strength will go from me, and I shall become weak,and be like any [other] man. 

{16:18} And when Delilah saw that he hadtold her all his heart, she sent and called for the lords of thePhilistines, saying, Come up this once, for he hath shewed me all hisheart. Then the lords of the Philistines came up unto her, and broughtmoney in their hand. 

{16:19} And she made him sleep upon her knees; andshe called for a man, and she caused him to shave off the seven locksof his head; and she began to afflict him, and his strength went fromhim. 

{16:20} And she said, The Philistines [be] upon thee, Samson. Andhe awoke out of his sleep, and said, I will go out as at other timesbefore, and shake myself. And he wist not that the LORD was departedfrom him.   

{16:21} But the Philistines took him, and put out his eyes, andbrought him down to Gaza, and bound him with fetters of brass; and hedid grind in the prison house. 

{16:22} Howbeit the hair of his headbegan to grow again after he was shaven. 

{16:23} Then the lords of thePhilistines gathered them together for to offer a great sacrifice untoDagon their god, and to rejoice: for they said, Our god hath deliveredSamson our enemy into our hand. 

{16:24} And when the people saw him,they praised their god: for they said, Our god hath delivered into ourhands our enemy, and the destroyer of our country, which slew many ofus. 

{16:25} And it came to pass, when their hearts were merry, thatthey said, Call for Samson, that he may make us sport. And they calledfor Samson out of the prison house; and he made them sport: and theyset him between the pillars. 

{16:26} And Samson said unto the lad thatheld him by the hand, Suffer me that I may feel the pillars whereuponthe house standeth, that I may lean upon them. 

{16:27} Now the housewas full of men and women; and all the lords of the Philistines [were]there; and [there were] upon the roof about three thousand men andwomen, that beheld while Samson made sport. 

{16:28} And Samson calledunto the LORD, and said, O Lord GOD, remember me, I pray thee, andstrengthen me, I pray thee, only this once, O God, that I may be atonce avenged of the Philistines for my two eyes. 

{16:29} And Samsontook hold of the two middle pillars upon which the house stood, and onwhich it was borne up, of the one with his right hand, and of the otherwith his left. 

{16:30} And Samson said, Let me die with thePhilistines. And he bowed himself with [all his] might; and the housefell upon the lords, and upon all the people that [were] therein. Sothe dead which he slew at his death were more than [they] which he slewin his life. 

{16:31} Then his brethren and all the house of his fathercame down, and took him, and brought [him] up, and buried him betweenZorah and Eshtaol in the buryingplace of Manoah his father. And hejudged Israel twenty years.   

{17:1} And there was a man of mount Ephraim, whose name [was] Micah.

{17:2} And he said unto his mother, The eleven hundred [shekels] ofsilver that were taken from thee, about which thou cursedst, andspakest of also in mine ears, behold, the silver is with me; I took it.And his mother said, Blessed [be thou] of the LORD, my son. 

{17:3} Andwhen he had restored the eleven hundred [shekels] of silver to hismother, his mother said, I had wholly dedicated the silver unto theLORD from my hand for my son, to make a graven image and a moltenimage: now therefore I will restore it unto thee. 

{17:4} Yet herestored the money unto his mother; and his mother took two hundred[shekels] of silver, and gave them to the founder, who made thereof agraven image and a molten image: and they were in the house of Micah.

{17:5} And the man Micah had an house of gods, and made an ephod, andteraphim, and consecrated one of his sons, who became his priest.

{17:6} In those days [there was] no king in Israel, [but] every man did[that which was] right in his own eyes.   

{17:7} And there was a young man out of Bethlehemjudah of the familyof Judah, who [was] a Levite, and he sojourned there. 

{17:8} And theman departed out of the city from Bethlehemjudah to sojourn where hecould find [a place:] and he came to mount Ephraim to the house ofMicah, as he journeyed. 

{17:9} And Micah said unto him, Whence comestthou? And he said unto him, I [am] a Levite of Bethlehemjudah, and I goto sojourn where I may find [a place. ]

{17:10} And Micah said unto him,Dwell with me, and be unto me a father and a priest, and I will givethee ten [shekels] of silver by the year, and a suit of apparel, andthy victuals. So the Levite went in. 

{17:11} And the Levite was contentto dwell with the man; and the young man was unto him as one of hissons. 

{17:12} And Micah consecrated the Levite; and the young manbecame his priest, and was in the house of Micah. 

{17:13} Then saidMicah, Now know I that the LORD will do me good, seeing I have a Leviteto [my] priest.   

{18:1} In those days [there was] no king in Israel: and in thosedays the tribe of the Danites sought them an inheritance to dwell in;for unto that day [all their] inheritance had not fallen unto themamong the tribes of Israel. 

{18:2} And the children of Dan sent oftheir family five men from their coasts, men of valour, from Zorah, andfrom Eshtaol, to spy out the land, and to search it; and they said untothem, Go, search the land: who when they came to mount Ephraim, to thehouse of Micah, they lodged there. 

{18:3} When they [were] by the houseof Micah, they knew the voice of the young man the Levite: and theyturned in thither, and said unto him, Who brought thee hither? and whatmakest thou in this [place?] and what hast thou here? 

{18:4} And hesaid unto them, Thus and thus dealeth Micah with me, and hath hired me,and I am his priest. 

{18:5} And they said unto him, Ask counsel, wepray thee, of God, that we may know whether our way which we go shallbe prosperous. 

{18:6} And the priest said unto them, Go in peace:before the LORD is your way wherein ye go.   

{18:7} Then the five men departed, and came to Laish, and saw thepeople that [were] therein, how they dwelt careless, after the mannerof the Zidonians, quiet and secure; and [there was] no magistrate inthe land, that might put [them] to shame in [any] thing; and they[were] far from the Zidonians, and had no business with [any] man.

{18:8} And they came unto their brethren to Zorah and Eshtaol: andtheir brethren said unto them, What [say] ye? 

{18:9} And they said,Arise, that we may go up against them: for we have seen the land, and,behold, it [is] very good: and [are] ye still? be not slothful to go,[and] to enter to possess the land. 

{18:10} When ye go, ye shall comeunto a people secure, and to a large land: for God hath given it intoyour hands; a place where [there is] no want of any thing that [is] inthe earth.   

{18:11} And there went from thence of the family of the Danites, outof Zorah and out of Eshtaol, six hundred men appointed with weapons ofwar. 

{18:12} And they went up, and pitched in Kirjath-jearim, in Judah:wherefore they called that place Mahaneh-dan unto this day: behold, [itis] behind Kirjath-jearim. 

{18:13} And they passed thence unto mountEphraim, and came unto the house of Micah.   

{18:14} Then answered the five men that went to spy out the countryof Laish, and said unto their brethren, Do ye know that there is inthese houses an ephod, and teraphim, and a graven image, and a moltenimage? now therefore consider what ye have to do. 

{18:15} And theyturned thitherward, and came to the house of the young man the Levite,[even] unto the house of Micah, and saluted him. 

{18:16} And the sixhundred men appointed with their weapons of war, which [were] of thechildren of Dan, stood by the entering of the gate. 

{18:17} And thefive men that went to spy out the land went up, [and] came in thither,[and] took the graven image, and the ephod, and the teraphim, and themolten image: and the priest stood in the entering of the gate with thesix hundred men [that were] appointed with weapons of war. 

{18:18} Andthese went into Micah's house, and fetched the carved image, the ephod,and the teraphim, and the molten image. Then said the priest unto them,What do ye? 

{18:19} And they said unto him, Hold thy peace, lay thinehand upon thy mouth, and go with us, and be to us a father and apriest: [is it] better for thee to be a priest unto the house of oneman, or that thou be a priest unto a tribe and a family in Israel?

{18:20} And the priest's heart was glad, and he took the ephod, and theteraphim, and the graven image, and went in the midst of the people.

{18:21} So they turned and departed, and put the little ones and thecattle and the carriage before them.   

{18:22} [And] when they were a good way from the house of Micah, themen that [were] in the houses near to Micah's house were gatheredtogether, and overtook the children of Dan. 

{18:23} And they cried untothe children of Dan. And they turned their faces, and said unto Micah,What aileth thee, that thou comest with such a company? 

{18:24} And hesaid, Ye have taken away my gods which I made, and the priest, and yeare gone away: and what have I more? and what [is] this [that] ye sayunto me, What aileth thee? 

{18:25} And the children of Dan said untohim, Let not thy voice be heard among us, lest angry fellows run uponthee, and thou lose thy life, with the lives of thy household. 

{18:26}And the children of Dan went their way: and when Micah saw that they[were] too strong for him, he turned and went back unto his house.

{18:27} And they took [the things] which Micah had made, and the priestwhich he had, and came unto Laish, unto a people [that were] at quietand secure: and they smote them with the edge of the sword, and burntthe city with fire. 

{18:28} And [there was] no deliverer, because it[was] far from Zidon, and they had no business with [any] man; and itwas in the valley that [lieth] by Beth-rehob. And they built a city,and dwelt therein. 

{18:29} And they called the name of the city Dan,after the name of Dan their father, who was born unto Israel: howbeitthe name of the city [was] Laish at the first.   

{18:30} And the children of Dan set up the graven image: andJonathan, the son of Gershom, the son of Manasseh, he and his sons werepriests to the tribe of Dan until the day of the captivity of the land.

{18:31} And they set them up Micah's graven image, which he made, allthe time that the house of God was in Shiloh.   

{19:1} And it came to pass in those days, when [there was] no kingin Israel, that there was a certain Levite sojourning on the side ofmount Ephraim, who took to him a concubine out of Bethlehemjudah.

{19:2} And his concubine played the whore against him, and went awayfrom him unto her father's house to Bethlehemjudah, and was there fourwhole months. 

{19:3} And her husband arose, and went after her, tospeak friendly unto her, [and] to bring her again, having his servantwith him, and a couple of asses: and she brought him into her father'shouse: and when the father of the damsel saw him, he rejoiced to meethim. 

{19:4} And his father in law, the damsel's father, retained him;and he abode with him three days: so they did eat and drink, and lodgedthere.   

{19:5} And it came to pass on the fourth day, when they arose earlyin the morning, that he rose up to depart: and the damsel's father saidunto his son in law, Comfort thine heart with a morsel of bread, andafterward go your way. 

{19:6} And they sat down, and did eat and drinkboth of them together: for the damsel's father had said unto the man,Be content, I pray thee, and tarry all night, and let thine heart bemerry. 

{19:7} And when the man rose up to depart, his father in lawurged him: therefore he lodged there again. 

{19:8} And he arose earlyin the morning on the fifth day to depart: and the damsel's fathersaid, Comfort thine heart, I pray thee. And they tarried untilafternoon, and they did eat both of them. 

{19:9} And when the man roseup to depart, he, and his concubine, and his servant, his father inlaw, the damsel's father, said unto him, Behold, now the day drawethtoward evening, I pray you tarry all night: behold, the day groweth toan end, lodge here, that thine heart may be merry; and to morrow getyou early on your way, that thou mayest go home. 

{19:10} But the manwould not tarry that night, but he rose up and departed, and came overagainst Jebus, which is Jerusalem; and [there were] with him two assessaddled, his concubine also [was] with him. 

{19:11} [And] when they[were] by Jebus, the day was far spent; and the servant said unto hismaster, Come, I pray thee, and let us turn in into this city of theJebusites, and lodge in it. 

{19:12} And his master said unto him, Wewill not turn aside hither into the city of a stranger, that [is] notof the children of Israel; we will pass over to Gibeah. 

{19:13} And hesaid unto his servant, Come, and let us draw near to one of theseplaces to lodge all night, in Gibeah, or in Ramah. 

{19:14} And theypassed on and went their way; and the sun went down upon them [whenthey were] by Gibeah, which [belongeth] to Benjamin. 

{19:15} And theyturned aside thither, to go in [and] to lodge in Gibeah: and when hewent in, he sat him down in a street of the city: for [there was] noman that took them into his house to lodging.   

{19:16} And, behold, there came an old man from his work out of thefield at even, which [was] also of mount Ephraim; and he sojourned inGibeah: but the men of the place [were] Benjamites. 

{19:17} And when hehad lifted up his eyes, he saw a wayfaring man in the street of thecity: and the old man said, Whither goest thou? and whence comest thou?

{19:18} And he said unto him, We [are] passing from Bethlehemjudahtoward the side of mount Ephraim; from thence [am] I: and I went toBethlehemjudah, but I [am now] going to the house of the LORD; andthere [is] no man that receiveth me to house. 

{19:19} Yet there is bothstraw and provender for our asses; and there is bread and wine also forme, and for thy handmaid, and for the young man [which is] with thyservants: [there is] no want of any thing. 

{19:20} And the old mansaid, Peace [be] with thee; howsoever [let] all thy wants [lie] uponme; only lodge not in the street. 

{19:21} So he brought him into hishouse, and gave provender unto the asses: and they washed their feet,and did eat and drink.   

{19:22} [Now] as they were making their hearts merry, behold, themen of the city, certain sons of Belial, beset the house round about,[and] beat at the door, and spake to the master of the house, the oldman, saying, Bring forth the man that came into thine house, that wemay know him. 

{19:23} And the man, the master of the house, went outunto them, and said unto them, Nay, my brethren, [nay,] I pray you, donot [so] wickedly; seeing that this man is come into mine house, do notthis folly. 

{19:24} Behold, [here is] my daughter a maiden, and hisconcubine; them I will bring out now, and humble ye them, and do withthem what seemeth good unto you: but unto this man do not so vile athing. 

{19:25} But the men would not hearken to him: so the man tookhis concubine, and brought her forth unto them; and they knew her, andabused her all the night until the morning: and when the day began tospring, they let her go. 

{19:26} Then came the woman in the dawning ofthe day, and fell down at the door of the man's house where her lord[was,] till it was light. 

{19:27} And her lord rose up in the morning,and opened the doors of the house, and went out to go his way: and,behold, the woman his concubine was fallen down [at] the door of thehouse, and her hands [were] upon the threshold. 

{19:28} And he saidunto her, Up, and let us be going. But none answered. Then the man tookher [up] upon an ass, and the man rose up, and gat him unto his place.   

{19:29} And when he was come into his house, he took a knife, andlaid hold on his concubine, and divided her, [together] with her bones,into twelve pieces, and sent her into all the coasts of Israel. 

{19:30}And it was so, that all that saw it said, There was no such deed donenor seen from the day that the children of Israel came up out of theland of Egypt unto this day: consider of it, take advice, and speak[your minds.]   

{20:1} Then all the children of Israel went out, and thecongregation was gathered together as one man, from Dan even toBeer-sheba, with the land of Gilead, unto the LORD in Mizpeh. 

{20:2}And the chief of all the people, [even] of all the tribes of Israel,presented themselves in the assembly of the people of God, four hundredthousand footmen that drew sword. 

{20:3} (Now the children of Benjaminheard that the children of Israel were gone up to Mizpeh.) Then saidthe children of Israel, Tell [us,] how was this wickedness? 

{20:4} Andthe Levite, the husband of the woman that was slain, answered and said,I came into Gibeah that [belongeth] to Benjamin, I and my concubine, tolodge. 

{20:5} And the men of Gibeah rose against me, and beset thehouse round about upon me by night, [and] thought to have slain me: andmy concubine have they forced, that she is dead. 

{20:6} And I took myconcubine, and cut her in pieces, and sent her throughout all thecountry of the inheritance of Israel: for they have committed lewdnessand folly in Israel. 

{20:7} Behold, ye [are] all children of Israel;give here your advice and counsel.   

{20:8} And all the people arose as one man, saying, We will not any[of us] go to his tent, neither will we any [of us] turn into hishouse. 

{20:9} But now this [shall be] the thing which we will do toGibeah; [we will go up] by lot against it; 

{20:10} And we will take tenmen of an hundred throughout all the tribes of Israel, and an hundredof a thousand, and a thousand out of ten thousand, to fetch victual forthe people, that they may do, when they come to Gibeah of Benjamin,according to all the folly that they have wrought in Israel. 

{20:11} Soall the men of Israel were gathered against the city, knit together asone man.   

{20:12} And the tribes of Israel sent men through all the tribe ofBenjamin, saying, What wickedness [is] this that is done among you?

{20:13} Now therefore deliver [us] the men, the children of Belial,which [are] in Gibeah, that we may put them to death, and put away evilfrom Israel. But the children of Benjamin would not hearken to thevoice of their brethren the children of Israel: 

{20:14} But thechildren of Benjamin gathered themselves together out of the citiesunto Gibeah, to go out to battle against the children of Israel.

{20:15} And the children of Benjamin were numbered at that time out ofthe cities twenty and six thousand men that drew sword, beside theinhabitants of Gibeah, which were numbered seven hundred chosen men.

{20:16} Among all this people [there were] seven hundred chosen menlefthanded; every one could sling stones at an hair [breadth,] and notmiss. 

{20:17} And the men of Israel, beside Benjamin, were numberedfour hundred thousand men that drew sword: all these [were] men of war.   

{20:18} And the children of Israel arose, and went up to the houseof God, and asked counsel of God, and said, Which of us shall go upfirst to the battle against the children of Benjamin? And the LORDsaid, Judah [shall go up] first. 

{20:19} And the children of Israelrose up in the morning, and encamped against Gibeah. 

{20:20} And themen of Israel went out to battle against Benjamin; and the men ofIsrael put themselves in array to fight against them at Gibeah. 

{20:21}And the children of Benjamin came forth out of Gibeah, and destroyeddown to the ground of the Israelites that day twenty and two thousandmen. 

{20:22} And the people the men of Israel encouraged themselves,and set their battle again in array in the place where they putthemselves in array the first day. 

{20:23} (And the children of Israelwent up and wept before the LORD until even, and asked counsel of theLORD, saying, Shall I go up again to battle against the children ofBenjamin my brother? And the LORD said, Go up against him.) 

{20:24} Andthe children of Israel came near against the children of Benjamin thesecond day. 

{20:25} And Benjamin went forth against them out of Gibeahthe second day, and destroyed down to the ground of the children ofIsrael again eighteen thousand men; all these drew the sword.   

{20:26} Then all the children of Israel, and all the people, wentup, and came unto the house of God, and wept, and sat there before theLORD, and fasted that day until even, and offered burnt offerings andpeace offerings before the LORD. 

{20:27} And the children of Israelenquired of the LORD, (for the ark of the covenant of God [was] therein those days, 

{20:28} And Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son ofAaron, stood before it in those days,) saying, Shall I yet again go outto battle against the children of Benjamin my brother, or shall Icease? And the LORD said, Go up; for to morrow I will deliver them intothine hand. 

{20:29} And Israel set liers in wait round about Gibeah.

{20:30} And the children of Israel went up against the children ofBenjamin on the third day, and put themselves in array against Gibeah,as at other times. 

{20:31} And the children of Benjamin went outagainst the people, [and] were drawn away from the city; and they beganto smite of the people, [and] kill, as at other times, in the highways,of which one goeth up to the house of God, and the other to Gibeah inthe field, about thirty men of Israel. 

{20:32} And the children ofBenjamin said, They [are] smitten down before us, as at the first. Butthe children of Israel said, Let us flee, and draw them from the cityunto the highways. 

{20:33} And all the men of Israel rose up out oftheir place, and put themselves in array at Baal-tamar: and the liersin wait of Israel came forth out of their places, [even] out of themeadows of Gibeah. 

{20:34} And there came against Gibeah ten thousandchosen men out of all Israel, and the battle was sore: but they knewnot that evil [was] near them. 

{20:35} And the LORD smote Benjaminbefore Israel: and the children of Israel destroyed of the Benjamitesthat day twenty and five thousand and an hundred men: all these drewthe sword. 

{20:36} So the children of Benjamin saw that they weresmitten: for the men of Israel gave place to the Benjamites, becausethey trusted unto the liers in wait which they had set beside Gibeah.

{20:37} And the liers in wait hasted, and rushed upon Gibeah; and theliers in wait drew [themselves] along, and smote all the city with theedge of the sword. 

{20:38} Now there was an appointed sign between themen of Israel and the liers in wait, that they should make a greatflame with smoke rise up out of the city. 

{20:39} And when the men ofIsrael retired in the battle, Benjamin began to smite [and] kill of themen of Israel about thirty persons: for they said, Surely they aresmitten down before us, as [in] the first battle. 

{20:40} But when theflame began to arise up out of the city with a pillar of smoke, theBenjamites looked behind them, and, behold, the flame of the cityascended up to heaven. 

{20:41} And when the men of Israel turned again,the men of Benjamin were amazed: for they saw that evil was come uponthem. 

{20:42} Therefore they turned [their backs] before the men ofIsrael unto the way of the wilderness; but the battle overtook them;and them which [came] out of the cities they destroyed in the midst ofthem. 

{20:43} [Thus] they inclosed the Benjamites round about, [and]chased them, [and] trode them down with ease over against Gibeah towardthe sunrising. 

{20:44} And there fell of Benjamin eighteen thousandmen; all these [were] men of valour. 

{20:45} And they turned and fledtoward the wilderness unto the rock of Rimmon: and they gleaned of themin the highways five thousand men; and pursued hard after them untoGidom, and slew two thousand men of them. 

{20:46} So that all whichfell that day of Benjamin were twenty and five thousand men that drewthe sword; all these [were] men of valour. 

{20:47} But six hundred menturned and fled to the wilderness unto the rock Rimmon, and abode inthe rock Rimmon four months. 

{20:48} And the men of Israel turned againupon the children of Benjamin, and smote them with the edge of thesword, as well the men of [every] city, as the beast, and all that cameto hand: also they set on fire all the cities that they came to.   

{21:1} Now the men of Israel had sworn in Mizpeh, saying, Thereshall not any of us give his daughter unto Benjamin to wife. 

{21:2} Andthe people came to the house of God, and abode there till even beforeGod, and lifted up their voices, and wept sore; 

{21:3} And said, O LORDGod of Israel, why is this come to pass in Israel, that there should beto day one tribe lacking in Israel? 

{21:4} And it came to pass on themorrow, that the people rose early, and built there an altar, andoffered burnt offerings and peace offerings. 

{21:5} And the children ofIsrael said, Who [is there] among all the tribes of Israel that camenot up with the congregation unto the LORD? For they had made a greatoath concerning him that came not up to the LORD to Mizpeh, saying, Heshall surely be put to death. 

{21:6} And the children of Israelrepented them for Benjamin their brother, and said, There is one tribecut off from Israel this day. 

{21:7} How shall we do for wives for themthat remain, seeing we have sworn by the LORD that we will not givethem of our daughters to wives?   

{21:8} And they said, What one [is there] of the tribes of Israelthat came not up to Mizpeh to the LORD? And, behold, there came none tothe camp from Jabesh-gilead to the assembly. 

{21:9} For the people werenumbered, and, behold, [there were] none of the inhabitants ofJabesh-gilead there. 

{21:10} And the congregation sent thither twelvethousand men of the valiantest, and commanded them, saying, Go andsmite the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead with the edge of the sword, withthe women and the children. 

{21:11} And this [is] the thing that yeshall do, Ye shall utterly destroy every male, and every woman thathath lain by man. 

{21:12} And they found among the inhabitants ofJabesh-gilead four hundred young virgins, that had known no man bylying with any male: and they brought them unto the camp to Shiloh,which is in the land of Canaan. 

{21:13} And the whole congregation sent[some] to speak to the children of Benjamin that [were] in the rockRimmon, and to call peaceably unto them. 

{21:14} And Benjamin cameagain at that time; and they gave them wives which they had saved aliveof the women of Jabesh- gilead: and yet so they sufficed them not.

{21:15} And the people repented them for Benjamin, because that theLORD had made a breach in the tribes of Israel.   

{21:16} Then the elders of the congregation said, How shall we dofor wives for them that remain, seeing the women are destroyed out ofBenjamin? 

{21:17} And they said, [There must be] an inheritance forthem that be escaped of Benjamin, that a tribe be not destroyed out ofIsrael. 

{21:18} Howbeit we may not give them wives of our daughters:for the children of Israel have sworn, saying, Cursed [be] he thatgiveth a wife to Benjamin. 

{21:19} Then they said, Behold, [there is] afeast of the LORD in Shiloh yearly [in a place] which [is] on the northside of Bethel, on the east side of the highway that goeth up fromBethel to Shechem, and on the south of Lebonah. 

{21:20} Therefore theycommanded the children of Benjamin, saying, Go and lie in wait in thevineyards; 

{21:21} And see, and, behold, if the daughters of Shilohcome out to dance in dances, then come ye out of the vineyards, andcatch you every man his wife of the daughters of Shiloh, and go to theland of Benjamin. 

{21:22} And it shall be, when their fathers or theirbrethren come unto us to complain, that we will say unto them, Befavourable unto them for our sakes: because we reserved not to each manhis wife in the war: for ye did not give unto them at this time, [that]ye should be guilty. 

{21:23} And the children of Benjamin did so, andtook [them] wives, according to their number, of them that danced, whomthey caught: and they went and returned unto their inheritance, andrepaired the cities, and dwelt in them. 

{21:24} And the children ofIsrael departed thence at that time, every man to his tribe and to hisfamily, and they went out from thence every man to his inheritance.

{21:25} In those days [there was] no king in Israel: every man did[that which was] right in his own eyes.
