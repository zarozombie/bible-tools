{The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians   

{1:1} Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, andTimotheus [our] brother, 

{1:2} To the saints and faithful brethren inChrist which are at Colosse: Grace [be] unto you, and peace, from Godour Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. 

{1:3} We give thanks to God andthe Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, praying always for you, 

{1:4}Since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus, and of the love [which yehave] to all the saints, 

{1:5} For the hope which is laid up for you inheaven, whereof ye heard before in the word of the truth of the gospel;

{1:6} Which is come unto you, as [it is] in all the world; and bringethforth fruit, as [it doth] also in you, since the day ye heard [of it,]and knew the grace of God in truth: 

{1:7} As ye also learned ofEpaphras our dear fellowservant, who is for you a faithful minister ofChrist; 

{1:8} Who also declared unto us your love in the Spirit. 

{1:9}For this cause we also, since the day we heard [it,] do not cease topray for you, and to desire that ye might be filled with the knowledgeof his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding; 

{1:10} That yemight walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing, being fruitful inevery good work, and increasing in the knowledge of God; 

{1:11}Strengthened with all might, according to his glorious power, unto allpatience and longsuffering with joyfulness; 

{1:12} Giving thanks untothe Father, which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritanceof the saints in light: 

{1:13} Who hath delivered us from the power ofdarkness, and hath translated [us] into the kingdom of his dear Son:

{1:14} In whom we have redemption through his blood, [even] theforgiveness of sins: 

{1:15} Who is the image of the invisible God, thefirstborn of every creature: 

{1:16} For by him were all things created,that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible,whether [they be] thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers:all things were created by him, and for him: 

{1:17} And he is beforeall things, and by him all things consist. 

{1:18} And he is the head ofthe body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from thedead; that in all [things] he might have the preeminence. 

{1:19} For itpleased [the Father] that in him should all fulness dwell; 

{1:20} And,having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to reconcileall things unto himself; by him, [I say,] whether [they be] things inearth, or things in heaven. 

{1:21} And you, that were sometimealienated and enemies in [your] mind by wicked works, yet now hath hereconciled 

{1:22} In the body of his flesh through death, to presentyou holy and unblameable and unreproveable in his sight: 

{1:23} If yecontinue in the faith grounded and settled, and [be] not moved awayfrom the hope of the gospel, which ye have heard, [and] which waspreached to every creature which is under heaven; whereof I Paul ammade a minister; 

{1:24} Who now rejoice in my sufferings for you, andfill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my fleshfor his body's sake, which is the church: 

{1:25} Whereof I am made aminister, according to the dispensation of God which is given to me foryou, to fulfil the word of God; 

{1:26} [Even] the mystery which hathbeen hid from ages and from generations, but now is made manifest tohis saints: 

{1:27} To whom God would make known what [is] the riches ofthe glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you,the hope of glory: 

{1:28} Whom we preach, warning every man, andteaching every man in all wisdom; that we may present every man perfectin Christ Jesus: 

{1:29} Whereunto I also labour, striving according tohis working, which worketh in me mightily.   

{2:1} For I would that ye knew what great conflict I have for you,and [for] them at Laodicea, and [for] as many as have not seen my facein the flesh; 

{2:2} That their hearts might be comforted, being knittogether in love, and unto all riches of the full assurance ofunderstanding, to the acknowledgement of the mystery of God, and of theFather, and of Christ; 

{2:3} In whom are hid all the treasures ofwisdom and knowledge. 

{2:4} And this I say, lest any man should beguileyou with enticing words. 

{2:5} For though I be absent in the flesh, yetam I with you in the spirit, joying and beholding your order, and thestedfastness of your faith in Christ.   

{2:6} As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, [so] walkye in him: 

{2:7} Rooted and built up in him, and stablished in thefaith, as ye have been taught, abounding therein with thanksgiving.

{2:8} Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit,after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and notafter Christ. 

{2:9} For in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godheadbodily. 

{2:10} And ye are complete in him, which is the head of allprincipality and power: 

{2:11} In whom also ye are circumcised with thecircumcision made without hands, in putting off the body of the sins ofthe flesh by the circumcision of Christ: 

{2:12} Buried with him inbaptism, wherein also ye are risen with [him] through the faith of theoperation of God, who hath raised him from the dead. 

{2:13} And you,being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh, hath hequickened together with him, having forgiven you all trespasses; 

{2:14}Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, whichwas contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to hiscross; 

{2:15} [And] having spoiled principalities and powers, he made ashew of them openly, triumphing over them in it. 

{2:16} Let no mantherefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of an holyday,or of the new moon, or of the sabbath [days: ]

{2:17} Which are a shadowof things to come; but the body [is] of Christ. 

{2:18} Let no manbeguile you of your reward in a voluntary humility and worshipping ofangels, intruding into those things which he hath not seen, vainlypuffed up by his fleshly mind, 

{2:19} And not holding the Head, fromwhich all the body by joints and bands having nourishment ministered,and knit together, increaseth with the increase of God.   

{2:20} Wherefore if ye be dead with Christ from the rudiments of theworld, why, as though living in the world, are ye subject toordinances, 

{2:21} (Touch not; taste not; handle not; 

{2:22} Which allare to perish with the using;) after the commandments and doctrines ofmen? 

{2:23} Which things have indeed a shew of wisdom in will worship,and humility, and neglecting of the body; not in any honour to thesatisfying of the flesh.   

{3:1} If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which areabove, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God. 

{3:2} Set youraffection on things above, not on things on the earth. 

{3:3} For ye aredead, and your life is hid with Christ in God. 

{3:4} When Christ, [whois] our life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear with him in glory.   

{3:5} Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth;fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, andcovetousness, which is idolatry: 

{3:6} For which things' sake the wrathof God cometh on the children of disobedience: 

{3:7} In the which yealso walked some time, when ye lived in them. 

{3:8} But now ye also putoff all these; anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy communicationout of your mouth. 

{3:9} Lie not one to another, seeing that ye haveput off the old man with his deeds; 

{3:10} And have put on the new[man,] which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him thatcreated him: 

{3:11} Where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcisionnor uncircumcision, Barbarian, Scythian, bond [nor] free: but Christ[is] all, and in all. 

{3:12} Put on therefore, as the elect of God,holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind,meekness, longsuffering; 

{3:13} Forbearing one another, and forgivingone another, if any man have a quarrel against any: even as Christforgave you, so also [do] ye. 

{3:14} And above all these things [puton] charity, which is the bond of perfectness. 

{3:15} And let the peaceof God rule in your hearts, to the which also ye are called in onebody; and be ye thankful. 

{3:16} Let the word of Christ dwell in yourichly in all wisdom; teaching and admonishing one another in psalmsand hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to theLord. 

{3:17} And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, [do] all in the nameof the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him.   

{3:18} Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as it is fitin the Lord. 

{3:19} Husbands, love [your] wives, and be not bitteragainst them. 

{3:20} Children, obey [your] parents in all things: forthis is well pleasing unto the Lord. 

{3:21} Fathers, provoke not yourchildren [to anger,] lest they be discouraged. 

{3:22} Servants, obey inall things [your] masters according to the flesh; not with eyeservice,as menpleasers; but in singleness of heart, fearing God: 

{3:23} Andwhatsoever ye do, do [it] heartily, as to the Lord, and not unto men;

{3:24} Knowing that of the Lord ye shall receive the reward of theinheritance: for ye serve the Lord Christ. 

{3:25} But he that doethwrong shall receive for the wrong which he hath done: and there is norespect of persons.   

{4:1} Masters, give unto [your] servants that which is just andequal; knowing that ye also have a Master in heaven.   

{4:2} Continue in prayer, and watch in the same with thanksgiving;

{4:3} Withal praying also for us, that God would open unto us a door ofutterance, to speak the mystery of Christ, for which I am also inbonds: 

{4:4} That I may make it manifest, as I ought to speak. 

{4:5}Walk in wisdom toward them that are without, redeeming the time. 

{4:6}Let your speech [be] alway with grace, seasoned with salt, that ye mayknow how ye ought to answer every man.   

{4:7} All my state shall Tychicus declare unto you, [who is] abeloved brother, and a faithful minister and fellowservant in the Lord:

{4:8} Whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose, that he mightknow your estate, and comfort your hearts; 

{4:9} With Onesimus, afaithful and beloved brother, who is [one] of you. They shall makeknown unto you all things which [are done] here.   

{4:10} Aristarchus my fellowprisoner saluteth you, and Marcus,sister's son to Barnabas, (touching whom ye received commandments: ifhe come unto you, receive him;) 

{4:11} And Jesus, which is calledJustus, who are of the circumcision. These only [are my] fellow workersunto the kingdom of God, which have been a comfort unto me. 

{4:12}Epaphras, who is [one] of you, a servant of Christ, saluteth you,always labouring fervently for you in prayers, that ye may standperfect and complete in all the will of God. 

{4:13} For I bear himrecord, that he hath a great zeal for you, and them [that are] inLaodicea, and them in Hierapolis. 

{4:14} Luke, the beloved physician,and Demas, greet you. 

{4:15} Salute the brethren which are in Laodicea,and Nymphas, and the church which is in his house. 

{4:16} And when thisepistle is read among you, cause that it be read also in the church ofthe Laodiceans; and that ye likewise read the [epistle] from Laodicea.

{4:17} And say to Archippus, Take heed to the ministry which thou hastreceived in the Lord, that thou fulfil it.   

{4:18} The salutation by the hand of me Paul. Remember my bonds.Grace [be] with you. Amen.
