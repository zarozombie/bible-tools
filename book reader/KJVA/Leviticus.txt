{1:3} If his offering [be] a burnt sacrifice ofthe herd, let him offer a male without blemish: he shall offer it ofhis own voluntary will at the door of the tabernacle of thecongregation before the LORD. 

{1:4} And he shall put his hand upon thehead of the burnt offering; and it shall be accepted for him to makeatonement for him. 

{1:5} And he shall kill the bullock before the LORD:and the priests, Aaron's sons, shall bring the blood, and sprinkle theblood round about upon the altar that [is by] the door of thetabernacle of the congregation. 

{1:6} And he shall flay the burntoffering, and cut it into his pieces.

{1:8} And the priests, Aaron's sons, shall lay the parts, thehead, and the fat, in order upon the wood that [is] on the fire which[is] upon the altar: 

{1:9} But his inwards and his legs shall he washin water: and the priest shall burn all on the altar, [to be] a burntsacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.   

{1:10} And if his offering [be] of the flocks, [namely,] of thesheep, or of the goats, for a burnt sacrifice; he shall bring it a malewithout blemish. 

{1:11} And he shall kill it on the side of the altarnorthward before the LORD: and the priests, Aaron's sons, shallsprinkle his blood round about upon the altar.

{1:16} And he shall pluck awayhis crop with his feathers, and cast it beside the altar on the eastpart, by the place of the ashes: 

{1:17} And he shall cleave it with thewings thereof, [but] shall not divide [it] asunder: and the priestshall burn it upon the altar, upon the wood that [is] upon the fire: it[is] a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savourunto the LORD.   

{2:1} And when any will offer a meat offering unto the LORD, hisoffering shall be [of] fine flour; and he shall pour oil upon it, andput frankincense thereon:

{2:11} No meatoffering, which ye shall bring unto the LORD, shall be made withleaven: for ye shall burn no leaven, nor any honey, in any offering ofthe LORD made by fire.   

{2:12} As for the oblation of the firstfruits, ye shall offer themunto the LORD: but they shall not be burnt on the altar for a sweetsavour. 

{2:13} And every oblation of thy meat offering shalt thouseason with salt; neither shalt thou suffer the salt of the covenant ofthy God to be lacking from thy meat offering: with all thine offeringsthou shalt offer salt. 

{2:14} And if thou offer a meat offering of thyfirstfruits unto the LORD, thou shalt offer for the meat offering ofthy firstfruits green ears of corn dried by the fire, [even] cornbeaten out of full ears. 

{2:15} And thou shalt put oil upon it, and layfrankincense thereon: it [is] a meat offering. 

{2:16} And the priestshall burn the memorial of it, [part] of the beaten corn thereof, and[part] of the oil thereof, with all the frankincense thereof: [it is]an offering made by fire unto the LORD.   

{3:1} And if his oblation [be] a sacrifice of peace offering, if heoffer [it] of the herd; whether [it be] a male or female, he shalloffer it without blemish before the LORD.

{3:17} [Itshall be] a perpetual statute for your generations throughout all yourdwellings, that ye eat neither fat nor blood.   

{4:1} And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 

{4:2} Speak unto thechildren of Israel, saying, If a soul shall sin through ignoranceagainst any of the commandments of the LORD [concerning things] whichought not to be done, and shall do against any of them: 

{4:3} If thepriest that is anointed do sin according to the sin of the people; thenlet him bring for his sin, which he hath sinned, a young bullockwithout blemish unto the LORD for a sin offering. 

{4:4} And he shallbring the bullock unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregationbefore the LORD; and shall lay his hand upon the bullock's head, andkill the bullock before the LORD. 

{4:5} And the priest that is anointedshall take of the bullock's blood, and bring it to the tabernacle ofthe congregation: 

{4:6} And the priest shall dip his finger in theblood, and sprinkle of the blood seven times before the LORD, beforethe vail of the sanctuary. 

{4:7} And the priest shall put [some] of theblood upon the horns of the altar of sweet incense before the LORD,which [is] in the tabernacle of the congregation: and shall pour allthe blood of the bullock at the bottom of the altar of the burntoffering, which [is at] the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.

{4:8} And he shall take off from it all the fat of the bullock for thesin offering; the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that[is] upon the inwards, 

{4:9} And the two kidneys, and the fat that [is]upon them, which [is] by the flanks, and the caul above the liver, withthe kidneys, it shall he take away, 

{4:10} As it was taken off from thebullock of the sacrifice of peace offerings: and the priest shall burnthem upon the altar of the burnt offering. 

{4:11} And the skin of thebullock, and all his flesh, with his head, and with his legs, and hisinwards, and his dung, 

{4:12} Even the whole bullock shall he carryforth without the camp unto a clean place, where the ashes are pouredout, and burn him on the wood with fire: where the ashes are poured outshall he be burnt.   

{4:13} And if the whole congregation of Israel sin throughignorance, and the thing be hid from the eyes of the assembly, and theyhave done [somewhat against] any of the commandments of the LORD[concerning things] which should not be done, and are guilty; 

{4:14}When the sin, which they have sinned against it, is known, then thecongregation shall offer a young bullock for the sin, and bring himbefore the tabernacle of the congregation. 

{4:15} And the elders of thecongregation shall lay their hands upon the head of the bullock beforethe LORD: and the bullock shall be killed before the LORD. 

{4:16} Andthe priest that is anointed shall bring of the bullock's blood to thetabernacle of the congregation: 

{4:17} And the priest shall dip hisfinger [in some] of the blood, and sprinkle [it] seven times before theLORD, [even] before the vail. 

{4:18} And he shall put [some] of theblood upon the horns of the altar which [is] before the LORD, that [is]in the tabernacle of the congregation, and shall pour out all the bloodat the bottom of the altar of the burnt offering, which [is at] thedoor of the tabernacle of the congregation. 

{4:19} And he shall takeall his fat from him, and burn [it] upon the altar. 

{4:20} And he shalldo with the bullock as he did with the bullock for a sin offering, soshall he do with this: and the priest shall make an atonement for them,and it shall be forgiven them. 

{4:21} And he shall carry forth thebullock without the camp, and burn him as he burned the first bullock:it [is] a sin offering for the congregation.   

{4:22} When a ruler hath sinned, and done [somewhat] throughignorance [against] any of the commandments of the LORD his God[concerning things] which should not be done, and is guilty; 

{4:23} Orif his sin, wherein he hath sinned, come to his knowledge; he shallbring his offering, a kid of the goats, a male without blemish: 

{4:24}And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the goat, and kill it in theplace where they kill the burnt offering before the LORD: it [is] a sinoffering. 

{4:25} And the priest shall take of the blood of the sinoffering with his finger, and put [it] upon the horns of the altar ofburnt offering, and shall pour out his blood at the bottom of the altarof burnt offering. 

{4:26} And he shall burn all his fat upon the altar,as the fat of the sacrifice of peace offerings: and the priest shallmake an atonement for him as concerning his sin, and it shall beforgiven him.   

{4:27} And if any one of the common people sin through ignorance,while he doeth [somewhat against] any of the commandments of the LORD[concerning things] which ought not to be done, and be guilty; 

{4:28}Or if his sin, which he hath sinned, come to his knowledge: then heshall bring his offering, a kid of the goats, a female without blemish,for his sin which he hath sinned. 

{4:29} And he shall lay his hand uponthe head of the sin offering, and slay the sin offering in the place ofthe burnt offering. 

{4:30} And the priest shall take of the bloodthereof with his finger, and put [it] upon the horns of the altar ofburnt offering, and shall pour out all the blood thereof at the bottomof the altar. 

{4:31} And he shall take away all the fat thereof, as thefat is taken away from off the sacrifice of peace offerings; and thepriest shall burn [it] upon the altar for a sweet savour unto the LORD;and the priest shall make an atonement for him, and it shall beforgiven him. 

{4:32} And if he bring a lamb for a sin offering, heshall bring it a female without blemish. 

{4:33} And he shall lay hishand upon the head of the sin offering, and slay it for a sin offeringin the place where they kill the burnt offering 

{4:34} And the priestshall take of the blood of the sin offering with his finger, and put[it] upon the horns of the altar of burnt offering, and shall pour outall the blood thereof at the bottom of the altar: 

{4:35} And he shalltake away all the fat thereof, as the fat of the lamb is taken awayfrom the sacrifice of the peace offerings; and the priest shall burnthem upon the altar, according to the offerings made by fire unto theLORD: and the priest shall make an atonement for his sin that he hathcommitted, and it shall be forgiven him.   

{5:1} And if a soul sin, and hear the voice of swearing, and [is] awitness, whether he hath seen or known [of it;] if he do not utter[it,] then he shall bear his iniquity. 

{5:2} Or if a soul touch anyunclean thing, whether [it be] a carcase of an unclean beast, or acarcase of unclean cattle, or the carcase of unclean creeping things,and [if] it be hidden from him; he also shall be unclean, and guilty.

{5:3} Or if he touch the uncleanness of man, whatsoever uncleanness [itbe] that a man shall be defiled withal, and it be hid from him; when heknoweth [of it,] then he shall be guilty. 

{5:4} Or if a soul swear,pronouncing with [his] lips to do evil, or to do good, whatsoever [itbe] that a man shall pronounce with an oath, and it be hid from him;when he knoweth [of it,] then he shall be guilty in one of these. 

{5:5}And it shall be, when he shall be guilty in one of these [things,] thathe shall confess that he hath sinned in that [thing: ]

{5:6} And heshall bring his trespass offering unto the LORD for his sin which hehath sinned, a female from the flock, a lamb or a kid of the goats, fora sin offering; and the priest shall make an atonement for himconcerning his sin. 

{5:7} And if he be not able to bring a lamb, thenhe shall bring for his trespass, which he hath committed, twoturtledoves, or two young pigeons, unto the LORD; one for a sinoffering, and the other for a burnt offering. 

{5:8} And he shall bringthem unto the priest, who shall offer [that] which [is] for the sinoffering first, and wring off his head from his neck, but shall notdivide [it] asunder: 

{5:9} And he shall sprinkle of the blood of thesin offering upon the side of the altar; and the rest of the bloodshall be wrung out at the bottom of the altar: it [is] a sin offering.

{5:10} And he shall offer the second [for] a burnt offering, accordingto the manner: and the priest shall make an atonement for him for hissin which he hath sinned, and it shall be forgiven him.   

{5:11} But if he be not able to bring two turtledoves, or two youngpigeons, then he that sinned shall bring for his offering the tenthpart of an ephah of fine flour for a sin offering; he shall put no oilupon it, neither shall he put [any] frankincense thereon: for it [is] asin offering. 

{5:12} Then shall he bring it to the priest, and thepriest shall take his handful of it, [even] a memorial thereof, andburn [it] on the altar, according to the offerings made by fire untothe LORD: it [is] a sin offering. 

{5:13} And the priest shall make anatonement for him as touching his sin that he hath sinned in one ofthese, and it shall be forgiven him: and [the remnant] shall be thepriest's, as a meat offering.   

{5:14} And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 

{5:15} If a soulcommit a trespass, and sin through ignorance, in the holy things of theLORD; then he shall bring for his trespass unto the LORD a ram withoutblemish out of the flocks, with thy estimation by shekels of silver,after the shekel of the sanctuary, for a trespass offering: 

{5:16} Andhe shall make amends for the harm that he hath done in the holy thing,and shall add the fifth part thereto, and give it unto the priest: andthe priest shall make an atonement for him with the ram of the trespassoffering, and it shall be forgiven him.   

{5:17} And if a soul sin, and commit any of these things which areforbidden to be done by the commandments of the LORD; though he wist[it] not, yet is he guilty, and shall bear his iniquity. 

{5:18} And heshall bring a ram without blemish out of the flock, with thyestimation, for a trespass offering, unto the priest: and the priestshall make an atonement for him concerning his ignorance wherein heerred and wist [it] not, and it shall be forgiven him. 

{5:19} It [is] atrespass offering: he hath certainly trespassed against the LORD.   

{6:1} And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 

{6:2} If a soul sin,and commit a trespass against the LORD, and lie unto his neighbour inthat which was delivered him to keep, or in fellowship, or in a thingtaken away by violence, or hath deceived his neighbour; 

{6:3} Or havefound that which was lost, and lieth concerning it, and swearethfalsely; in any of all these that a man doeth, sinning therein: 

{6:4}Then it shall be, because he hath sinned, and is guilty, that he shallrestore that which he took violently away, or the thing which he hathdeceitfully gotten, or that which was delivered him to keep, or thelost thing which he found, 

{6:5} Or all that about which he hath swornfalsely; he shall even restore it in the principal, and shall add thefifth part more thereto, [and] give it unto him to whom itappertaineth, in the day of his trespass offering. 

{6:6} And he shallbring his trespass offering unto the LORD, a ram without blemish out ofthe flock, with thy estimation, for a trespass offering, unto thepriest: 

{6:7} And the priest shall make an atonement for him before theLORD: and it shall be forgiven him for any thing of all that he hathdone in trespassing therein.   

{6:8} And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 

{6:9} Command Aaron andhis sons, saying, This [is] the law of the burnt offering: It [is] theburnt offering, because of the burning upon the altar all night untothe morning, and the fire of the altar shall be burning in it. 

{6:10}And the priest shall put on his linen garment, and his linen breechesshall he put upon his flesh, and take up the ashes which the fire hathconsumed with the burnt offering on the altar, and he shall put thembeside the altar. 

{6:11} And he shall put off his garments, and put onother garments, and carry forth the ashes without the camp unto a cleanplace. 

{6:12} And the fire upon the altar shall be burning in it; itshall not be put out: and the priest shall burn wood on it everymorning, and lay the burnt offering in order upon it; and he shall burnthereon the fat of the peace offerings. 

{6:13} The fire shall ever beburning upon the altar; it shall never go out.   

{6:14} And this [is] the law of the meat offering: the sons of Aaronshall offer it before the LORD, before the altar. 

{6:15} And he shalltake of it his handful, of the flour of the meat offering, and of theoil thereof, and all the frankincense which [is] upon the meatoffering, and shall burn [it] upon the altar [for] a sweet savour,[even] the memorial of it, unto the LORD. 

{6:16} And the remainderthereof shall Aaron and his sons eat: with unleavened bread shall it beeaten in the holy place; in the court of the tabernacle of thecongregation they shall eat it. 

{6:17} It shall not be baken withleaven. I have given it [unto them for] their portion of my offeringsmade by fire; it [is] most holy, as [is] the sin offering, and as thetrespass offering. 

{6:18} All the males among the children of Aaronshall eat of it. [It shall be] a statute for ever in your generationsconcerning the offerings of the LORD made by fire: every one thattoucheth them shall be holy.   

{6:19} And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 

{6:20} This [is] theoffering of Aaron and of his sons, which they shall offer unto the LORDin the day when he is anointed; the tenth part of an ephah of fineflour for a meat offering perpetual, half of it in the morning, andhalf thereof at night. 

{6:21} In a pan it shall be made with oil; [andwhen it is] baken, thou shalt bring it in: [and] the baken pieces ofthe meat offering shalt thou offer [for] a sweet savour unto the LORD.

{6:22} And the priest of his sons that is anointed in his stead shalloffer it: [it is] a statute for ever unto the LORD, it shall be whollyburnt. 

{6:23} For every meat offering for the priest shall be whollyburnt: it shall not be eaten.   

{6:24} And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 

{6:25} Speak untoAaron and to his sons, saying, This [is] the law of the sin offering:In the place where the burnt offering is killed shall the sin offeringbe killed before the LORD: it [is] most holy. 

{6:26} The priest thatoffereth it for sin shall eat it: in the holy place shall it be eaten,in the court of the tabernacle of the congregation. 

{6:27} Whatsoevershall touch the flesh thereof shall be holy: and when there issprinkled of the blood thereof upon any garment, thou shalt wash thatwhereon it was sprinkled in the holy place. 

{6:28} But the earthenvessel wherein it is sodden shall be broken: and if it be sodden in abrasen pot, it shall be both scoured, and rinsed in water. 

{6:29} Allthe males among the priests shall eat thereof: it [is] most holy.

{6:30} And no sin offering, whereof [any] of the blood is brought intothe tabernacle of the congregation to reconcile [withal] in the holy[place,] shall be eaten: it shall be burnt in the fire.   

{7:1} Likewise this [is] the law of the trespass offering: it [is]most holy. 

{7:2} In the place where they kill the burnt offering shallthey kill the trespass offering: and the blood thereof shall hesprinkle round about upon the altar. 

{7:3} And he shall offer of it allthe fat thereof; the rump, and the fat that covereth the inwards, 

{7:4}And the two kidneys, and the fat that [is] on them, which [is] by theflanks, and the caul [that is] above the liver, with the kidneys, itshall he take away: 

{7:5} And the priest shall burn them upon the altar[for] an offering made by fire unto the LORD: it [is] a trespassoffering. 

{7:6} Every male among the priests shall eat thereof: itshall be eaten in the holy place: it [is] most holy. 

{7:7} As the sinoffering [is,] so [is] the trespass offering: [there is] one law forthem: the priest that maketh atonement therewith shall have [it. ]

{7:8}And the priest that offereth any man's burnt offering, [even] thepriest shall have to himself the skin of the burnt offering which hehath offered. 

{7:9} And all the meat offering that is baken in theoven, and all that is dressed in the fryingpan, and in the pan, shallbe the priest's that offereth it. 

{7:10} And every meat offering,mingled with oil, and dry, shall all the sons of Aaron have, one [asmuch] as another. 

{7:11} And this [is] the law of the sacrifice ofpeace offerings, which he shall offer unto the LORD. 

{7:12} If he offerit for a thanksgiving, then he shall offer with the sacrifice ofthanksgiving unleavened cakes mingled with oil, and unleavened wafersanointed with oil, and cakes mingled with oil, of fine flour, fried.

{7:13} Besides the cakes, he shall offer [for] his offering leavenedbread with the sacrifice of thanksgiving of his peace offerings. 

{7:14}And of it he shall offer one out of the whole oblation [for] an heaveoffering unto the LORD, [and] it shall be the priest's that sprinkleththe blood of the peace offerings. 

{7:15} And the flesh of the sacrificeof his peace offerings for thanksgiving shall be eaten the same daythat it is offered; he shall not leave any of it until the morning.

{7:16} But if the sacrifice of his offering [be] a vow, or a voluntaryoffering, it shall be eaten the same day that he offereth hissacrifice: and on the morrow also the remainder of it shall be eaten:

{7:17} But the remainder of the flesh of the sacrifice on the third dayshall be burnt with fire. 

{7:18} And if [any] of the flesh of thesacrifice of his peace offerings be eaten at all on the third day, itshall not be accepted, neither shall it be imputed unto him thatoffereth it: it shall be an abomination, and the soul that eateth of itshall bear his iniquity. 

{7:19} And the flesh that toucheth any unclean[thing] shall not be eaten; it shall be burnt with fire: and as for theflesh, all that be clean shall eat thereof. 

{7:20} But the soul thateateth [of] the flesh of the sacrifice of peace offerings, that[pertain] unto the LORD, having his uncleanness upon him, even thatsoul shall be cut off from his people. 

{7:21} Moreover the soul thatshall touch any unclean [thing, as] the uncleanness of man, or [any]unclean beast, or any abominable unclean [thing,] and eat of the fleshof the sacrifice of peace offerings, which [pertain] unto the LORD,even that soul shall be cut off from his people.   

{7:22} And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 

{7:23} Speak unto thechildren of Israel, saying, Ye shall eat no manner of fat, of ox, or ofsheep, or of goat. 

{7:24} And the fat of the beast that dieth ofitself, and the fat of that which is torn with beasts, may be used inany other use: but ye shall in no wise eat of it. 

{7:25} For whosoevereateth the fat of the beast, of which men offer an offering made byfire unto the LORD, even the soul that eateth [it] shall be cut offfrom his people. 

{7:26} Moreover ye shall eat no manner of blood,[whether it be] of fowl or of beast, in any of your dwellings. 

{7:27}Whatsoever soul [it be] that eateth any manner of blood, even that soulshall be cut off from his people.   

{7:28} And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 

{7:29} Speak unto thechildren of Israel, saying, He that offereth the sacrifice of his peaceofferings unto the LORD shall bring his oblation unto the LORD of thesacrifice of his peace offerings. 

{7:30} His own hands shall bring theofferings of the LORD made by fire, the fat with the breast, it shallhe bring, that the breast may be waved [for] a wave offering before theLORD. 

{7:31} And the priest shall burn the fat upon the altar: but thebreast shall be Aaron's and his sons'. 

{7:32} And the right shouldershall ye give unto the priest [for] an heave offering of the sacrificesof your peace offerings. 

{7:33} He among the sons of Aaron, thatoffereth the blood of the peace offerings, and the fat, shall have theright shoulder for [his] part. 

{7:34} For the wave breast and the heaveshoulder have I taken of the children of Israel from off the sacrificesof their peace offerings, and have given them unto Aaron the priest andunto his sons by a statute for ever from among the children of Israel.   

{7:35} This [is the portion] of the anointing of Aaron, and of theanointing of his sons, out of the offerings of the LORD made by fire,in the day [when] he presented them to minister unto the LORD in thepriest's office; 

{7:36} Which the LORD commanded to be given them ofthe children of Israel, in the day that he anointed them, [by] astatute for ever throughout their generations. 

{7:37} This [is] the lawof the burnt offering, of the meat offering, and of the sin offering,and of the trespass offering, and of the consecrations, and of thesacrifice of the peace offerings; 

{7:38} Which the LORD commanded Mosesin mount Sinai, in the day that he commanded the children of Israel tooffer their oblations unto the LORD, in the wilderness of Sinai.   

{8:1} And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 

{8:2} Take Aaron andhis sons with him, and the garments, and the anointing oil, and abullock for the sin offering, and two rams, and a basket of unleavenedbread; 

{8:3} And gather thou all the congregation together unto thedoor of the tabernacle of the congregation. 

{8:4} And Moses did as theLORD commanded him; and the assembly was gathered together unto thedoor of the tabernacle of the congregation. 

{8:5} And Moses said untothe congregation, This [is] the thing which the LORD commanded to bedone. 

{8:6} And Moses brought Aaron and his sons, and washed them withwater. 

{8:7} And he put upon him the coat, and girded him with thegirdle, and clothed him with the robe, and put the ephod upon him, andhe girded him with the curious girdle of the ephod, and bound [it] untohim therewith. 

{8:8} And he put the breastplate upon him: also he putin the breastplate the Urim and the Thummim. 

{8:9} And he put the mitreupon his head; also upon the mitre, [even] upon his forefront, did heput the golden plate, the holy crown; as the LORD commanded Moses.

{8:10} And Moses took the anointing oil, and anointed the tabernacleand all that [was] therein, and sanctified them. 

{8:11} And hesprinkled thereof upon the altar seven times, and anointed the altarand all his vessels, both the laver and his foot, to sanctify them.

{8:12} And he poured of the anointing oil upon Aaron's head, andanointed him, to sanctify him. 

{8:13} And Moses brought Aaron's sons,and put coats upon them, and girded them with girdles, and put bonnetsupon them; as the LORD commanded Moses. 

{8:14} And he brought thebullock for the sin offering: and Aaron and his sons laid their handsupon the head of the bullock for the sin offering. 

{8:15} And he slew[it;] and Moses took the blood, and put [it] upon the horns of thealtar round about with his finger, and purified the altar, and pouredthe blood at the bottom of the altar, and sanctified it, to makereconciliation upon it. 

{8:16} And he took all the fat that [was] uponthe inwards, and caul [above] the liver, and the two kidneys, and theirfat, and Moses burned [it] upon the altar. 

{8:17} But the bullock, andhis hide, his flesh, and his dung, he burnt with fire without the camp;as the LORD commanded Moses.   

{8:18} And he brought the ram for the burnt offering: and Aaron andhis sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram. 

{8:19} And hekilled [it;] and Moses sprinkled the blood upon the altar round about.

{8:20} And he cut the ram into pieces; and Moses burnt the head, andthe pieces, and the fat. 

{8:21} And he washed the inwards and the legsin water; and Moses burnt the whole ram upon the altar: it [was] aburnt sacrifice for a sweet savour, [and] an offering made by fire untothe LORD; as the LORD commanded Moses.   

{8:22} And he brought the other ram, the ram of consecration: andAaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram. 

{8:23}And he slew [it;] and Moses took of the blood of it, and put [it] uponthe tip of Aaron's right ear, and upon the thumb of his right hand, andupon the great toe of his right foot. 

{8:24} And he brought Aaron'ssons, and Moses put of the blood upon the tip of their right ear, andupon the thumbs of their right hands, and upon the great toes of theirright feet: and Moses sprinkled the blood upon the altar round about.

{8:25} And he took the fat, and the rump, and all the fat that [was]upon the inwards, and the caul [above] the liver, and the two kidneys,and their fat, and the right shoulder: 

{8:26} And out of the basket ofunleavened bread, that [was] before the LORD, he took one unleavenedcake, and a cake of oiled bread, and one wafer, and put [them] on thefat, and upon the right shoulder: 

{8:27} And he put all upon Aaron'shands, and upon his sons' hands, and waved them [for] a wave offeringbefore the LORD. 

{8:28} And Moses took them from off their hands, andburnt [them] on the altar upon the burnt offering: they [were]consecrations for a sweet savour: it [is] an offering made by fire untothe LORD. 

{8:29} And Moses took the breast, and waved it [for] a waveoffering before the LORD: [for] of the ram of consecration it wasMoses' part; as the LORD commanded Moses. 

{8:30} And Moses took of theanointing oil, and of the blood which [was] upon the altar, andsprinkled [it] upon Aaron, [and] upon his garments, and upon his sons,and upon his sons' garments with him; and sanctified Aaron, [and] hisgarments, and his sons, and his sons' garments with him.   

{8:31} And Moses said unto Aaron and to his sons, Boil the flesh atthe door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and there eat it withthe bread that [is] in the basket of consecrations, as I commanded,saying, Aaron and his sons shall eat it. 

{8:32} And that whichremaineth of the flesh and of the bread shall ye burn with fire. 

{8:33}And ye shall not go out of the door of the tabernacle of thecongregation [in] seven days, until the days of your consecration be atan end: for seven days shall he consecrate you. 

{8:34} As he hath donethis day, [so] the LORD hath commanded to do, to make an atonement foryou. 

{8:35} Therefore shall ye abide [at] the door of the tabernacle ofthe congregation day and night seven days, and keep the charge of theLORD, that ye die not: for so I am commanded. 

{8:36} So Aaron and hissons did all things which the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses.   

{9:1} And it came to pass on the eighth day, [that] Moses calledAaron and his sons, and the elders of Israel; 

{9:2} And he said untoAaron, Take thee a young calf for a sin offering, and a ram for a burntoffering, without blemish, and offer [them] before the LORD. 

{9:3} Andunto the children of Israel thou shalt speak, saying, Take ye a kid ofthe goats for a sin offering; and a calf and a lamb, [both] of thefirst year, without blemish, for a burnt offering; 

{9:4} Also a bullockand a ram for peace offerings, to sacrifice before the LORD; and a meatoffering mingled with oil: for to day the LORD will appear unto you.   

{9:5} And they brought [that] which Moses commanded before thetabernacle of the congregation: and all the congregation drew near andstood before the LORD. 

{9:6} And Moses said, This [is] the thing whichthe LORD commanded that ye should do: and the glory of the LORD shallappear unto you. 

{9:7} And Moses said unto Aaron, Go unto the altar,and offer thy sin offering, and thy burnt offering, and make anatonement for thyself, and for the people: and offer the offering ofthe people, and make an atonement for them; as the LORD commanded.   

{9:8} Aaron therefore went unto the altar, and slew the calf of thesin offering, which [was] for himself. 

{9:9} And the sons of Aaronbrought the blood unto him: and he dipped his finger in the blood, andput [it] upon the horns of the altar, and poured out the blood at thebottom of the altar: 

{9:10} But the fat, and the kidneys, and the caulabove the liver of the sin offering, he burnt upon the altar; as theLORD commanded Moses. 

{9:11} And the flesh and the hide he burnt withfire without the camp. 

{9:12} And he slew the burnt offering; andAaron's sons presented unto him the blood, which he sprinkled roundabout upon the altar. 

{9:13} And they presented the burnt offering untohim, with the pieces thereof, and the head: and he burnt [them] uponthe altar. 

{9:14} And he did wash the inwards and the legs, and burnt[them] upon the burnt offering on the altar.   

{9:15} And he brought the people's offering, and took the goat,which [was] the sin offering for the people, and slew it, and offeredit for sin, as the first. 

{9:16} And he brought the burnt offering, andoffered it according to the manner. 

{9:17} And he brought the meatoffering, and took an handful thereof, and burnt [it] upon the altar,beside the burnt sacrifice of the morning. 

{9:18} He slew also thebullock and the ram [for] a sacrifice of peace offerings, which [was]for the people: and Aaron's sons presented unto him the blood, which hesprinkled upon the altar round about, 

{9:19} And the fat of the bullockand of the ram, the rump, and that which covereth [the inwards,] andthe kidneys, and the caul [above] the liver: 

{9:20} And they put thefat upon the breasts, and he burnt the fat upon the altar: 

{9:21} Andthe breasts and the right shoulder Aaron waved [for] a wave offeringbefore the LORD; as Moses commanded. 

{9:22} And Aaron lifted up hishand toward the people, and blessed them, and came down from offeringof the sin offering, and the burnt offering, and peace offerings.

{9:23} And Moses and Aaron went into the tabernacle of thecongregation, and came out, and blessed the people: and the glory ofthe LORD appeared unto all the people. 

{9:24} And there came a fire outfrom before the LORD, and consumed upon the altar the burnt offeringand the fat: [which] when all the people saw, they shouted, and fell ontheir faces.   

{10:1} And Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, took either of themhis censer, and put fire therein, and put incense thereon, and offeredstrange fire before the LORD, which he commanded them not. 

{10:2} Andthere went out fire from the LORD, and devoured them, and they diedbefore the LORD. 

{10:3} Then Moses said unto Aaron, This [is it] thatthe LORD spake, saying, I will be sanctified in them that come nigh me,and before all the people I will be glorified. And Aaron held hispeace. 

{10:4} And Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of Uzzielthe uncle of Aaron, and said unto them, Come near, carry your brethrenfrom before the sanctuary out of the camp. 

{10:5} So they went near,and carried them in their coats out of the camp; as Moses had said.

{10:6} And Moses said unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar,his sons, Uncover not your heads, neither rend your clothes; lest yedie, and lest wrath come upon all the people: but let your brethren,the whole house of Israel, bewail the burning which the LORD hathkindled. 

{10:7} And ye shall not go out from the door of the tabernacleof the congregation, lest ye die: for the anointing oil of the LORD[is] upon you. And they did according to the word of Moses.   

{10:8} And the LORD spake unto Aaron, saying, 

{10:9} Do not drinkwine nor strong drink, thou, nor thy sons with thee, when ye go intothe tabernacle of the congregation, lest ye die: [it shall be] astatute for ever throughout your generations: 

{10:10} And that ye mayput difference between holy and unholy, and between unclean and clean;

{10:11} And that ye may teach the children of Israel all the statuteswhich the LORD hath spoken unto them by the hand of Moses.   

{10:12} And Moses spake unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar and untoIthamar, his sons that were left, Take the meat offering that remainethof the offerings of the LORD made by fire, and eat it without leavenbeside the altar: for it [is] most holy: 

{10:13} And ye shall eat it inthe holy place, because it [is] thy due, and thy sons' due, of thesacrifices of the LORD made by fire: for so I am commanded. 

{10:14} Andthe wave breast and heave shoulder shall ye eat in a clean place; thou,and thy sons, and thy daughters with thee: for [they be] thy due, andthy sons' due, [which] are given out of the sacrifices of peaceofferings of the children of Israel. 

{10:15} The heave shoulder and thewave breast shall they bring with the offerings made by fire of thefat, to wave [it for] a wave offering before the LORD; and it shall bethine, and thy sons' with thee, by a statute for ever; as the LORD hathcommanded.   

{10:16} And Moses diligently sought the goat of the sin offering,and, behold, it was burnt: and he was angry with Eleazar and Ithamar,the sons of Aaron [which were] left [alive,] saying, 

{10:17} Whereforehave ye not eaten the sin offering in the holy place, seeing it [is]most holy, and [God] hath given it you to bear the iniquity of thecongregation, to make atonement for them before the LORD? 

{10:18}Behold, the blood of it was not brought in within the holy [place:] yeshould indeed have eaten it in the holy [place,] as I commanded.

{10:19} And Aaron said unto Moses, Behold, this day have they offeredtheir sin offering and their burnt offering before the LORD; and suchthings have befallen me: and [if] I had eaten the sin offering to day,should it have been accepted in the sight of the LORD? 

{10:20} And whenMoses heard [that,] he was content.   

{11:1} And the LORD spake unto Moses and to Aaron, saying unto them,

{11:2} Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, These [are] thebeasts which ye shall eat among all the beasts that [are] on the earth.

{11:3} Whatsoever parteth the hoof, and is clovenfooted, [and] cheweththe cud, among the beasts, that shall ye eat. 

{11:4} Nevertheless theseshall ye not eat of them that chew the cud, or of them that divide thehoof: [as] the camel, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not thehoof; he is unclean unto you. 

{11:5} And the coney, because he cheweththe cud, but divideth not the hoof; he [is] unclean unto you. 

{11:6}And the hare, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof; he[is] unclean unto you. 

{11:7} And the swine, though he divide the hoof,and be clovenfooted, yet he cheweth not the cud; he [is] unclean toyou. 

{11:8} Of their flesh shall ye not eat, and their carcase shall yenot touch; they [are] unclean to you.   

{11:9} These shall ye eat of all that [are] in the waters:whatsoever hath fins and scales in the waters, in the seas, and in therivers, them shall ye eat. 

{11:10} And all that have not fins andscales in the seas, and in the rivers, of all that move in the waters,and of any living thing which [is] in the waters, they [shall be] anabomination unto you: 

{11:11} They shall be even an abomination untoyou; ye shall not eat of their flesh, but ye shall have their carcasesin abomination. 

{11:12} Whatsoever hath no fins nor scales in thewaters, that [shall be] an abomination unto you.   

{11:13} And these [are they which ye] shall have in abominationamong the fowls; they shall not be eaten, they [are] an abomination:the eagle, and the ossifrage, and the ospray, 

{11:14} And the vulture,and the kite after his kind; 

{11:15} Every raven after his kind;

{11:16} And the owl, and the night hawk, and the cuckow, and the hawkafter his kind, 

{11:17} And the little owl, and the cormorant, and thegreat owl, 

{11:18} And the swan, and the pelican, and the gier eagle,

{11:19} And the stork, the heron after her kind, and the lapwing, andthe bat. 

{11:20} All fowls that creep, going upon [all] four, [shallbe] an abomination unto you. 

{11:21} Yet these may ye eat of everyflying creeping thing that goeth upon [all] four, which have legs abovetheir feet, to leap withal upon the earth; 

{11:22} [Even] these of themye may eat; the locust after his kind, and the bald locust after hiskind, and the beetle after his kind, and the grasshopper after hiskind. 

{11:23} But all [other] flying creeping things, which have fourfeet, [shall be] an abomination unto you. 

{11:24} And for these yeshall be unclean: whosoever toucheth the carcase of them shall beunclean until the even. 

{11:25} And whosoever beareth [ought] of thecarcase of them shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even.

{11:26} [The carcases] of every beast which divideth the hoof, and [is]not clovenfooted, nor cheweth the cud, [are] unclean unto you: everyone that toucheth them shall be unclean. 

{11:27} And whatsoever goethupon his paws, among all manner of beasts that go on [all] four, those[are] unclean unto you: whoso toucheth their carcase shall be uncleanuntil the even. 

{11:28} And he that beareth the carcase of them shallwash his clothes, and be unclean until the even: they [are] uncleanunto you.   

{11:29} These also [shall be] unclean unto you among the creepingthings that creep upon the earth; the weasel, and the mouse, and thetortoise after his kind, 

{11:30} And the ferret, and the chameleon, andthe lizard, and the snail, and the mole. 

{11:31} These [are] unclean toyou among all that creep: whosoever doth touch them, when they be dead,shall be unclean until the even. 

{11:32} And upon whatsoever [any] ofthem, when they are dead, doth fall, it shall be unclean; whether [itbe] any vessel of wood, or raiment, or skin, or sack, whatsoever vessel[it be,] wherein [any] work is done, it must be put into water, and itshall be unclean until the even; so it shall be cleansed. 

{11:33} Andevery earthen vessel, whereinto [any] of them falleth, whatsoever is init shall be unclean; and ye shall break it. 

{11:34} Of all meat whichmay be eaten, [that] on which [such] water cometh shall be unclean: andall drink that may be drunk in every [such] vessel shall be unclean.

{11:35} And every [thing] whereupon [any part] of their carcase fallethshall be unclean; [whether it be] oven, or ranges for pots, they shallbe broken down: [for] they [are] unclean, and shall be unclean untoyou. 

{11:36} Nevertheless a fountain or pit, [wherein there is] plentyof water, shall be clean: but that which toucheth their carcase shallbe unclean. 

{11:37} And if [any part] of their carcase fall upon anysowing seed which is to be sown, it [shall be] clean. 

{11:38} But if[any] water be put upon the seed, and [any part] of their carcase fallthereon, it [shall be] unclean unto you. 

{11:39} And if any beast, ofwhich ye may eat, die; he that toucheth the carcase thereof shall beunclean until the even. 

{11:40} And he that eateth of the carcase of itshall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even: he also thatbeareth the carcase of it shall wash his clothes, and be unclean untilthe even. 

{11:41} And every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth[shall be] an abomination; it shall not be eaten. 

{11:42} Whatsoevergoeth upon the belly, and whatsoever goeth upon [all] four, orwhatsoever hath more feet among all creeping things that creep upon theearth, them ye shall not eat; for they [are] an abomination. 

{11:43} Yeshall not make yourselves abominable with any creeping thing thatcreepeth, neither shall ye make yourselves unclean with them, that yeshould be defiled thereby. 

{11:44} For I [am] the LORD your God: yeshall therefore sanctify yourselves, and ye shall be holy; for I [am]holy: neither shall ye defile yourselves with any manner of creepingthing that creepeth upon the earth. 

{11:45} For I [am] the LORD thatbringeth you up out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: ye shalltherefore be holy, for I [am] holy. 

{11:46} This [is] the law of thebeasts, and of the fowl, and of every living creature that moveth inthe waters, and of every creature that creepeth upon the earth: 

{11:47}To make a difference between the unclean and the clean, and between thebeast that may be eaten and the beast that may not be eaten.   

{12:1} And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 

{12:2} Speak unto thechildren of Israel, saying, If a woman have conceived seed, and born aman child: then she shall be unclean seven days; according to the daysof the separation for her infirmity shall she be unclean. 

{12:3} And inthe eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised. 

{12:4}And she shall then continue in the blood of her purifying three andthirty days; she shall touch no hallowed thing, nor come into thesanctuary, until the days of her purifying be fulfilled. 

{12:5} But ifshe bear a maid child, then she shall be unclean two weeks, as in herseparation: and she shall continue in the blood of her purifyingthreescore and six days. 

{12:6} And when the days of her purifying arefulfilled, for a son, or for a daughter, she shall bring a lamb of thefirst year for a burnt offering, and a young pigeon, or a turtledove,for a sin offering, unto the door of the tabernacle of thecongregation, unto the priest: 

{12:7} Who shall offer it before theLORD, and make an atonement for her; and she shall be cleansed from theissue of her blood. This [is] the law for her that hath born a male ora female. 

{12:8} And if she be not able to bring a lamb, then she shallbring two turtles, or two young pigeons; the one for the burntoffering, and the other for a sin offering: and the priest shall makean atonement for her, and she shall be clean.   

{13:1} And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron, saying, 

{13:2} Whena man shall have in the skin of his flesh a rising, a scab, or a brightspot, and it be in the skin of his flesh [like] the plague of leprosy;then he shall be brought unto Aaron the priest, or unto one of his sonsthe priests: 

{13:3} And the priest shall look on the plague in the skinof the flesh: and [when] the hair in the plague is turned white, andthe plague in sight [be] deeper than the skin of his flesh, it [is] aplague of leprosy: and the priest shall look on him, and pronounce himunclean. 

{13:4} If the bright spot [be] white in the skin of his flesh,and in sight [be] not deeper than the skin, and the hair thereof be notturned white; then the priest shall shut up [him that hath] the plagueseven days: 

{13:5} And the priest shall look on him the seventh day:and, behold, [if] the plague in his sight be at a stay, [and] theplague spread not in the skin; then the priest shall shut him up sevendays more: 

{13:6} And the priest shall look on him again the seventhday: and, behold, [if] the plague [be] somewhat dark, [and] the plaguespread not in the skin, the priest shall pronounce him clean: it [isbut] a scab: and he shall wash his clothes, and be clean. 

{13:7} But ifthe scab spread much abroad in the skin, after that he hath been seenof the priest for his cleansing, he shall be seen of the priest again:

{13:8} And [if] the priest see that, behold, the scab spreadeth in theskin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it [is] a leprosy.   

{13:9} When the plague of leprosy is in a man, then he shall bebrought unto the priest; 

{13:10} And the priest shall see [him:] and,behold, [if] the rising [be] white in the skin, and it have turned thehair white, and [there be] quick raw flesh in the rising; 

{13:11} It[is] an old leprosy in the skin of his flesh, and the priest shallpronounce him unclean, and shall not shut him up: for he [is] unclean.

{13:12} And if a leprosy break out abroad in the skin, and the leprosycover all the skin of [him that hath] the plague from his head even tohis foot, wheresoever the priest looketh; 

{13:13} Then the priest shallconsider: and, behold, [if] the leprosy have covered all his flesh, heshall pronounce [him] clean [that hath] the plague: it is all turnedwhite: he [is] clean. 

{13:14} But when raw flesh appeareth in him, heshall be unclean. 

{13:15} And the priest shall see the raw flesh, andpronounce him to be unclean: [for] the raw flesh [is] unclean: it [is]a leprosy. 

{13:16} Or if the raw flesh turn again, and be changed untowhite, he shall come unto the priest; 

{13:17} And the priest shall seehim: and, behold, [if] the plague be turned into white; then the priestshall pronounce [him] clean [that hath] the plague: he [is] clean.   

{13:18} The flesh also, in which, [even] in the skin thereof, was aboil, and is healed, 

{13:19} And in the place of the boil there be awhite rising, or a bright spot, white, and somewhat reddish, and it beshewed to the priest; 

{13:20} And if, when the priest seeth it, behold,it [be] in sight lower than the skin, and the hair thereof be turnedwhite; the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it [is] a plague ofleprosy broken out of the boil. 

{13:21} But if the priest look on it,and, behold, [there be] no white hairs therein, and [if] it [be] notlower than the skin, but [be] somewhat dark; then the priest shall shuthim up seven days: 

{13:22} And if it spread much abroad in the skin,then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it [is] a plague. 

{13:23}But if the bright spot stay in his place, [and] spread not, it [is] aburning boil; and the priest shall pronounce him clean.   

{13:24} Or if there be [any] flesh, in the skin whereof [there is] ahot burning, and the quick [flesh] that burneth have a white brightspot, somewhat reddish, or white; 

{13:25} Then the priest shall lookupon it: and, behold, [if] the hair in the bright spot be turned white,and it [be in] sight deeper than the skin; it [is] a leprosy broken outof the burning: wherefore the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it[is] the plague of leprosy. 

{13:26} But if the priest look on it, and,behold, [there be] no white hair in the bright spot, and it [be] nolower than the [other] skin, but [be] somewhat dark; then the priestshall shut him up seven days: 

{13:27} And the priest shall look uponhim the seventh day: [and] if it be spread much abroad in the skin,then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it [is] the plague ofleprosy. 

{13:28} And if the bright spot stay in his place, [and] spreadnot in the skin, but it [be] somewhat dark; it [is] a rising of theburning, and the priest shall pronounce him clean: for it [is] aninflammation of the burning.   

{13:29} If a man or woman have a plague upon the head or the beard;

{13:30} Then the priest shall see the plague: and, behold, if it [be]in sight deeper than the skin; [and there be] in it a yellow thin hair;then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it [is] a dry scall,[even] a leprosy upon the head or beard. 

{13:31} And if the priest lookon the plague of the scall, and, behold, it [be] not in sight deeperthan the skin, and [that there is] no black hair in it; then the priestshall shut up [him that hath] the plague of the scall seven days:

{13:32} And in the seventh day the priest shall look on the plague:and, behold, [if] the scall spread not, and there be in it no yellowhair, and the scall [be] not in sight deeper than the skin; 

{13:33} Heshall be shaven, but the scall shall he not shave; and the priest shallshut up [him that hath] the scall seven days more: 

{13:34} And in theseventh day the priest shall look on the scall: and, behold, [if] thescall be not spread in the skin, nor [be] in sight deeper than theskin; then the priest shall pronounce him clean: and he shall wash hisclothes, and be clean. 

{13:35} But if the scall spread much in the skinafter his cleansing; 

{13:36} Then the priest shall look on him: and,behold, if the scall be spread in the skin, the priest shall not seekfor yellow hair; he [is] unclean. 

{13:37} But if the scall be in hissight at a stay, and [that] there is black hair grown up therein; thescall is healed, he [is] clean: and the priest shall pronounce himclean.   

{13:38} If a man also or a woman have in the skin of their fleshbright spots, [even] white bright spots; 

{13:39} Then the priest shalllook: and, behold, [if] the bright spots in the skin of their flesh[be] darkish white; it [is] a freckled spot [that] groweth in the skin;he [is] clean. 

{13:40} And the man whose hair is fallen off his head,he [is] bald; [yet is] he clean. 

{13:41} And he that hath his hairfallen off from the part of his head toward his face, he [is] foreheadbald: [yet is] he clean. 

{13:42} And if there be in the bald head, orbald forehead, a white reddish sore; it [is] a leprosy sprung up in hisbald head, or his bald forehead. 

{13:43} Then the priest shall lookupon it: and, behold, [if] the rising of the sore [be] white reddish inhis bald head, or in his bald forehead, as the leprosy appeareth in theskin of the flesh; 

{13:44} He is a leprous man, he [is] unclean: thepriest shall pronounce him utterly unclean; his plague [is] in hishead. 

{13:45} And the leper in whom the plague [is,] his clothes shallbe rent, and his head bare, and he shall put a covering upon his upperlip, and shall cry, Unclean, unclean. 

{13:46} All the days wherein theplague [shall be] in him he shall be defiled; he [is] unclean: he shalldwell alone; without the camp [shall] his habitation [be.]   

{13:47} The garment also that the plague of leprosy is in, [whetherit be] a woollen garment, or a linen garment; 

{13:48} Whether [it be]in the warp, or woof; of linen, or of woollen; whether in a skin, or inany thing made of skin; 

{13:49} And if the plague be greenish orreddish in the garment, or in the skin, either in the warp, or in thewoof, or in any thing of skin; it [is] a plague of leprosy, and shallbe shewed unto the priest: 

{13:50} And the priest shall look upon theplague, and shut up [it that hath] the plague seven days: 

{13:51} Andhe shall look on the plague on the seventh day: if the plague be spreadin the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in a skin, [or]in any work that is made of skin; the plague [is] a fretting leprosy;it [is] unclean. 

{13:52} He shall therefore burn that garment, whetherwarp or woof, in woollen or in linen, or any thing of skin, wherein theplague is: for it [is] a fretting leprosy; it shall be burnt in thefire. 

{13:53} And if the priest shall look, and, behold, the plague benot spread in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or inany thing of skin; 

{13:54} Then the priest shall command that they wash[the thing] wherein the plague [is,] and he shall shut it up seven daysmore: 

{13:55} And the priest shall look on the plague, after that it iswashed: and, behold, [if] the plague have not changed his colour, andthe plague be not spread; it [is] unclean; thou shalt burn it in thefire; it [is] fret inward, [whether] it [be] bare within or without.

{13:56} And if the priest look, and, behold, the plague [be] somewhatdark after the washing of it; then he shall rend it out of the garment,or out of the skin, or out of the warp, or out of the woof: 

{13:57} Andif it appear still in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof,or in any thing of skin; it [is] a spreading [plague:] thou shalt burnthat wherein the plague [is] with fire. 

{13:58} And the garment, eitherwarp, or woof, or whatsoever thing of skin [it be,] which thou shaltwash, if the plague be departed from them, then it shall be washed thesecond time, and shall be clean. 

{13:59} This [is] the law of theplague of leprosy in a garment of woollen or linen, either in the warp,or woof, or any thing of skins, to pronounce it clean, or to pronounceit unclean.   

{14:1} And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 

{14:2} This shall bethe law of the leper in the day of his cleansing: He shall be broughtunto the priest: 

{14:3} And the priest shall go forth out of the camp;and the priest shall look, and, behold, [if] the plague of leprosy behealed in the leper; 

{14:4} Then shall the priest command to take forhim that is to be cleansed two birds alive [and] clean, and cedar wood,and scarlet, and hyssop: 

{14:5} And the priest shall command that oneof the birds be killed in an earthen vessel over running water: 

{14:6}As for the living bird, he shall take it, and the cedar wood, and thescarlet, and the hyssop, and shall dip them and the living bird in theblood of the bird [that was] killed over the running water: 

{14:7} Andhe shall sprinkle upon him that is to be cleansed from the leprosyseven times, and shall pronounce him clean, and shall let the livingbird loose into the open field. 

{14:8} And he that is to be cleansedshall wash his clothes, and shave off all his hair, and wash himself inwater, that he may be clean: and after that he shall come into thecamp, and shall tarry abroad out of his tent seven days. 

{14:9} But itshall be on the seventh day, that he shall shave all his hair off hishead and his beard and his eyebrows, even all his hair he shall shaveoff: and he shall wash his clothes, also he shall wash his flesh inwater, and he shall be clean. 

{14:10} And on the eighth day he shalltake two he lambs without blemish, and one ewe lamb of the first yearwithout blemish, and three tenth deals of fine flour [for] a meatoffering, mingled with oil, and one log of oil. 

{14:11} And the priestthat maketh [him] clean shall present the man that is to be made clean,and those things, before the LORD, [at] the door of the tabernacle ofthe congregation: 

{14:12} And the priest shall take one he lamb, andoffer him for a trespass offering, and the log of oil, and wave them[for] a wave offering before the LORD: 

{14:13} And he shall slay thelamb in the place where he shall kill the sin offering and the burntoffering, in the holy place: for as the sin offering [is] the priest's,[so is] the trespass offering: it [is] most holy: 

{14:14} And thepriest shall take [some] of the blood of the trespass offering, and thepriest shall put [it] upon the tip of the right ear of him that is tobe cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the greattoe of his right foot: 

{14:15} And the priest shall take [some] of thelog of oil, and pour [it] into the palm of his own left hand: 

{14:16}And the priest shall dip his right finger in the oil that [is] in hisleft hand, and shall sprinkle of the oil with his finger seven timesbefore the LORD: 

{14:17} And of the rest of the oil that [is] in hishand shall the priest put upon the tip of the right ear of him that isto be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon thegreat toe of his right foot, upon the blood of the trespass offering:

{14:18} And the remnant of the oil that [is] in the priest's hand heshall pour upon the head of him that is to be cleansed: and the priestshall make an atonement for him before the LORD. 

{14:19} And the priestshall offer the sin offering, and make an atonement for him that is tobe cleansed from his uncleanness; and afterward he shall kill the burntoffering: 

{14:20} And the priest shall offer the burnt offering and themeat offering upon the altar: and the priest shall make an atonementfor him, and he shall be clean. 

{14:21} And if he [be] poor, and cannotget so much; then he shall take one lamb [for] a trespass offering tobe waved, to make an atonement for him, and one tenth deal of fineflour mingled with oil for a meat offering, and a log of oil; 

{14:22}And two turtledoves, or two young pigeons, such as he is able to get;and the one shall be a sin offering, and the other a burnt offering.

{14:23} And he shall bring them on the eighth day for his cleansingunto the priest, unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation,before the LORD. 

{14:24} And the priest shall take the lamb of thetrespass offering, and the log of oil, and the priest shall wave them[for] a wave offering before the LORD: 

{14:25} And he shall kill thelamb of the trespass offering, and the priest shall take [some] of theblood of the trespass offering, and put [it] upon the tip of the rightear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his righthand, and upon the great toe of his right foot: 

{14:26} And the priestshall pour of the oil into the palm of his own left hand: 

{14:27} Andthe priest shall sprinkle with his right finger [some] of the oil that[is] in his left hand seven times before the LORD: 

{14:28} And thepriest shall put of the oil that [is] in his hand upon the tip of theright ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of hisright hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot, upon the place ofthe blood of the trespass offering: 

{14:29} And the rest of the oilthat [is] in the priest's hand he shall put upon the head of him thatis to be cleansed, to make an atonement for him before the LORD.

{14:30} And he shall offer the one of the turtledoves, or of the youngpigeons, such as he can get; 

{14:31} [Even] such as he is able to get,the one [for] a sin offering, and the other [for] a burnt offering,with the meat offering: and the priest shall make an atonement for himthat is to be cleansed before the LORD. 

{14:32} This [is] the law [ofhim] in whom [is] the plague of leprosy, whose hand is not able to get[that which pertaineth] to his cleansing.   

{14:33} And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,

{14:34} When ye be come into the land of Canaan, which I give to youfor a possession, and I put the plague of leprosy in a house of theland of your possession; 

{14:35} And he that owneth the house shallcome and tell the priest, saying, It seemeth to me [there is] as itwere a plague in the house: 

{14:36} Then the priest shall command thatthey empty the house, before the priest go [into it] to see the plague,that all that [is] in the house be not made unclean: and afterward thepriest shall go in to see the house: 

{14:37} And he shall look on theplague, and, behold, [if] the plague [be] in the walls of the housewith hollow strakes, greenish or reddish, which in sight [are] lowerthan the wall; 

{14:38} Then the priest shall go out of the house to thedoor of the house, and shut up the house seven days: 

{14:39} And thepriest shall come again the seventh day, and shall look: and, behold,[if] the plague be spread in the walls of the house; 

{14:40} Then thepriest shall command that they take away the stones in which the plague[is,] and they shall cast them into an unclean place without the city:

{14:41} And he shall cause the house to be scraped within round about,and they shall pour out the dust that they scrape off without the cityinto an unclean place: 

{14:42} And they shall take other stones, andput [them] in the place of those stones; and he shall take othermorter, and shall plaister the house. 

{14:43} And if the plague comeagain, and break out in the house, after that he hath taken away thestones, and after he hath scraped the house, and after it isplaistered; 

{14:44} Then the priest shall come and look, and, behold,[if] the plague be spread in the house, it [is] a fretting leprosy inthe house: it is unclean. 

{14:45} And he shall break down the house,the stones of it, and the timber thereof, and all the morter of thehouse; and he shall carry [them] forth out of the city into an uncleanplace. 

{14:46} Moreover he that goeth into the house all the while thatit is shut up shall be unclean until the even. 

{14:47} And he thatlieth in the house shall wash his clothes; and he that eateth in thehouse shall wash his clothes. 

{14:48} And if the priest shall come in,and look [upon it,] and, behold, the plague hath not spread in thehouse, after the house was plaistered: then the priest shall pronouncethe house clean, because the plague is healed. 

{14:49} And he shalltake to cleanse the house two birds, and cedar wood, and scarlet, andhyssop: 

{14:50} And he shall kill the one of the birds in an earthenvessel over running water: 

{14:51} And he shall take the cedar wood,and the hyssop, and the scarlet, and the living bird, and dip them inthe blood of the slain bird, and in the running water, and sprinkle thehouse seven times: 

{14:52} And he shall cleanse the house with theblood of the bird, and with the running water, and with the livingbird, and with the cedar wood, and with the hyssop, and with thescarlet: 

{14:53} But he shall let go the living bird out of the cityinto the open fields, and make an atonement for the house: and it shallbe clean. 

{14:54} This [is] the law for all manner of plague ofleprosy, and scall, 

{14:55} And for the leprosy of a garment, and of ahouse, 

{14:56} And for a rising, and for a scab, and for a bright spot:

{14:57} To teach when [it is] unclean, and when [it is] clean: this[is] the law of leprosy.   

{15:1} And the LORD spake unto Moses and to Aaron, saying, 

{15:2}Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When any man hatha running issue out of his flesh, [because of] his issue he [is]unclean. 

{15:3} And this shall be his uncleanness in his issue: whetherhis flesh run with his issue, or his flesh be stopped from his issue,it [is] his uncleanness. 

{15:4} Every bed, whereon he lieth that haththe issue, is unclean: and every thing, whereon he sitteth, shall beunclean. 

{15:5} And whosoever toucheth his bed shall wash his clothes,and bathe [himself] in water, and be unclean until the even. 

{15:6} Andhe that sitteth on [any] thing whereon he sat that hath the issue shallwash his clothes, and bathe [himself] in water, and be unclean untilthe even. 

{15:7} And he that toucheth the flesh of him that hath theissue shall wash his clothes, and bathe [himself] in water, and beunclean until the even. 

{15:8} And if he that hath the issue spit uponhim that is clean; then he shall wash his clothes, and bathe [himself]in water, and be unclean until the even. 

{15:9} And what saddle soeverhe rideth upon that hath the issue shall be unclean. 

{15:10} Andwhosoever toucheth any thing that was under him shall be unclean untilthe even: and he that beareth [any of] those things shall wash hisclothes, and bathe [himself] in water, and be unclean until the even.

{15:11} And whomsoever he toucheth that hath the issue, and hath notrinsed his hands in water, he shall wash his clothes, and bathe[himself] in water, and be unclean until the even. 

{15:12} And thevessel of earth, that he toucheth which hath the issue, shall bebroken: and every vessel of wood shall be rinsed in water. 

{15:13} Andwhen he that hath an issue is cleansed of his issue; then he shallnumber to himself seven days for his cleansing, and wash his clothes,and bathe his flesh in running water, and shall be clean. 

{15:14} Andon the eighth day he shall take to him two turtledoves, or two youngpigeons, and come before the LORD unto the door of the tabernacle ofthe congregation, and give them unto the priest: 

{15:15} And the priestshall offer them, the one [for] a sin offering, and the other [for] aburnt offering; and the priest shall make an atonement for him beforethe LORD for his issue. 

{15:16} And if any man's seed of copulation goout from him, then he shall wash all his flesh in water, and be uncleanuntil the even. 

{15:17} And every garment, and every skin, whereon isthe seed of copulation, shall be washed with water, and be uncleanuntil the even. 

{15:18} The woman also with whom man shall lie [with]seed of copulation, they shall [both] bathe [themselves] in water, andbe unclean until the even.   

{15:19} And if a woman have an issue, [and] her issue in her fleshbe blood, she shall be put apart seven days: and whosoever toucheth hershall be unclean until the even. 

{15:20} And every thing that she liethupon in her separation shall be unclean: every thing also that shesitteth upon shall be unclean. 

{15:21} And whosoever toucheth her bedshall wash his clothes, and bathe [himself] in water, and be uncleanuntil the even. 

{15:22} And whosoever toucheth any thing that she satupon shall wash his clothes, and bathe [himself] in water, and beunclean until the even. 

{15:23} And if it [be] on [her] bed, or on anything whereon she sitteth, when he toucheth it, he shall be uncleanuntil the even. 

{15:24} And if any man lie with her at all, and herflowers be upon him, he shall be unclean seven days; and all the bedwhereon he lieth [shall be] unclean. 

{15:25} And if a woman have anissue of her blood many days out of the time of her separation, or ifit run beyond the time of her separation; all the days of the issue ofher uncleanness shall be as the days of her separation: she shall beunclean. 

{15:26} Every bed whereon she lieth all the days of her issueshall be unto her as the bed of her separation: and whatsoever shesitteth upon shall be unclean, as the uncleanness of her separation.

{15:27} And whosoever toucheth those things shall be unclean, and shallwash his clothes, and bathe [himself] in water, and be unclean untilthe even. 

{15:28} But if she be cleansed of her issue, then she shallnumber to herself seven days, and after that she shall be clean.

{15:29} And on the eighth day she shall take unto her two turtles, ortwo young pigeons, and bring them unto the priest, to the door of thetabernacle of the congregation. 

{15:30} And the priest shall offer theone [for] a sin offering, and the other [for] a burnt offering; and thepriest shall make an atonement for her before the LORD for the issue ofher uncleanness. 

{15:31} Thus shall ye separate the children of Israelfrom their uncleanness; that they die not in their uncleanness, whenthey defile my tabernacle that [is] among them. 

{15:32} This [is] thelaw of him that hath an issue, and [of him] whose seed goeth from him,and is defiled therewith; 

{15:33} And of her that is sick of herflowers, and of him that hath an issue, of the man, and of the woman,and of him that lieth with her that is unclean.   

{16:1} And the LORD spake unto Moses after the death of the two sonsof Aaron, when they offered before the LORD, and died; 

{16:2} And theLORD said unto Moses, Speak unto Aaron thy brother, that he come not atall times into the holy [place] within the vail before the mercy seat,which [is] upon the ark; that he die not: for I will appear in thecloud upon the mercy seat. 

{16:3} Thus shall Aaron come into the holy[place:] with a young bullock for a sin offering, and a ram for a burntoffering. 

{16:4} He shall put on the holy linen coat, and he shall havethe linen breeches upon his flesh, and shall be girded with a linengirdle, and with the linen mitre shall he be attired: these [are] holygarments; therefore shall he wash his flesh in water, and [so] put themon. 

{16:5} And he shall take of the congregation of the children ofIsrael two kids of the goats for a sin offering, and one ram for aburnt offering. 

{16:6} And Aaron shall offer his bullock of the sinoffering, which [is] for himself, and make an atonement for himself,and for his house. 

{16:7} And he shall take the two goats, and presentthem before the LORD [at] the door of the tabernacle of thecongregation. 

{16:8} And Aaron shall cast lots upon the two goats; onelot for the LORD, and the other lot for the scapegoat. 

{16:9} And Aaronshall bring the goat upon which the LORD'S lot fell, and offer him[for] a sin offering. 

{16:10} But the goat, on which the lot fell to bethe scapegoat, shall be presented alive before the LORD, to make anatonement with him, [and] to let him go for a scapegoat into thewilderness. 

{16:11} And Aaron shall bring the bullock of the sinoffering, which [is] for himself, and shall make an atonement forhimself, and for his house, and shall kill the bullock of the sinoffering which [is] for himself: 

{16:12} And he shall take a censerfull of burning coals of fire from off the altar before the LORD, andhis hands full of sweet incense beaten small, and bring [it] within thevail: 

{16:13} And he shall put the incense upon the fire before theLORD, that the cloud of the incense may cover the mercy seat that [is]upon the testimony, that he die not: 

{16:14} And he shall take of theblood of the bullock, and sprinkle [it] with his finger upon the mercyseat eastward; and before the mercy seat shall he sprinkle of the bloodwith his finger seven times.   

{16:15} Then shall he kill the goat of the sin offering, that [is]for the people, and bring his blood within the vail, and do with thatblood as he did with the blood of the bullock, and sprinkle it upon themercy seat, and before the mercy seat: 

{16:16} And he shall make anatonement for the holy [place,] because of the uncleanness of thechildren of Israel, and because of their transgressions in all theirsins: and so shall he do for the tabernacle of the congregation, thatremaineth among them in the midst of their uncleanness. 

{16:17} Andthere shall be no man in the tabernacle of the congregation when hegoeth in to make an atonement in the holy [place,] until he come out,and have made an atonement for himself, and for his household, and forall the congregation of Israel. 

{16:18} And he shall go out unto thealtar that [is] before the LORD, and make an atonement for it; andshall take of the blood of the bullock, and of the blood of the goat,and put [it] upon the horns of the altar round about. 

{16:19} And heshall sprinkle of the blood upon it with his finger seven times, andcleanse it, and hallow it from the uncleanness of the children ofIsrael.   

{16:20} And when he hath made an end of reconciling the holy[place,] and the tabernacle of the congregation, and the altar, heshall bring the live goat: 

{16:21} And Aaron shall lay both his handsupon the head of the live goat, and confess over him all the iniquitiesof the children of Israel, and all their transgressions in all theirsins, putting them upon the head of the goat, and shall send [him] awayby the hand of a fit man into the wilderness: 

{16:22} And the goatshall bear upon him all their iniquities unto a land not inhabited: andhe shall let go the goat in the wilderness. 

{16:23} And Aaron shallcome into the tabernacle of the congregation, and shall put off thelinen garments, which he put on when he went into the holy [place,] andshall leave them there: 

{16:24} And he shall wash his flesh with waterin the holy place, and put on his garments, and come forth, and offerhis burnt offering, and the burnt offering of the people, and make anatonement for himself, and for the people. 

{16:25} And the fat of thesin offering shall he burn upon the altar. 

{16:26} And he that let gothe goat for the scapegoat shall wash his clothes, and bathe his fleshin water, and afterward come into the camp. 

{16:27} And the bullock[for] the sin offering, and the goat [for] the sin offering, whoseblood was brought in to make atonement in the holy [place,] shall [one]carry forth without the camp; and they shall burn in the fire theirskins, and their flesh, and their dung. 

{16:28} And he that burneththem shall wash his clothes, and bathe his flesh in water, andafterward he shall come into the camp.   

{16:29} And [this] shall be a statute for ever unto you: [that] inthe seventh month, on the tenth [day] of the month, ye shall afflictyour souls, and do no work at all, [whether it be] one of your owncountry, or a stranger that sojourneth among you: 

{16:30} For on thatday shall [the priest] make an atonement for you, to cleanse you,[that] ye may be clean from all your sins before the LORD. 

{16:31} It[shall be] a sabbath of rest unto you, and ye shall afflict your souls,by a statute for ever. 

{16:32} And the priest, whom he shall anoint,and whom he shall consecrate to minister in the priest's office in hisfather's stead, shall make the atonement, and shall put on the linenclothes, [even] the holy garments: 

{16:33} And he shall make anatonement for the holy sanctuary, and he shall make an atonement forthe tabernacle of the congregation, and for the altar, and he shallmake an atonement for the priests, and for all the people of thecongregation. 

{16:34} And this shall be an everlasting statute untoyou, to make an atonement for the children of Israel for all their sinsonce a year. And he did as the LORD commanded Moses.   

{17:1} And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 

{17:2} Speak untoAaron, and unto his sons, and unto all the children of Israel, and sayunto them; This [is] the thing which the LORD hath commanded, saying,

{17:3} What man soever [there be] of the house of Israel, that killethan ox, or lamb, or goat, in the camp, or that killeth [it] out of thecamp, 

{17:4} And bringeth it not unto the door of the tabernacle of thecongregation, to offer an offering unto the LORD before the tabernacleof the LORD; blood shall be imputed unto that man; he hath shed blood;and that man shall be cut off from among his people: 

{17:5} To the endthat the children of Israel may bring their sacrifices, which theyoffer in the open field, even that they may bring them unto the LORD,unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, unto the priest,and offer them [for] peace offerings unto the LORD. 

{17:6} And thepriest shall sprinkle the blood upon the altar of the LORD [at] thedoor of the tabernacle of the congregation, and burn the fat for asweet savour unto the LORD. 

{17:7} And they shall no more offer theirsacrifices unto devils, after whom they have gone a whoring. This shallbe a statute for ever unto them throughout their generations.   

{17:8} And thou shalt say unto them, Whatsoever man [there be] ofthe house of Israel, or of the strangers which sojourn among you, thatoffereth a burnt offering of sacrifice, 

{17:9} And bringeth it not untothe door of the tabernacle of the congregation, to offer it unto theLORD; even that man shall be cut off from among his people.   

{17:10} And whatsoever man [there be] of the house of Israel, or ofthe strangers that sojourn among you, that eateth any manner of blood;I will even set my face against that soul that eateth blood, and willcut him off from among his people. 

{17:11} For the life of the flesh[is] in the blood: and I have given it to you upon the altar to make anatonement for your souls: for it [is] the blood [that] maketh anatonement for the soul. 

{17:12} Therefore I said unto the children ofIsrael, No soul of you shall eat blood, neither shall any stranger thatsojourneth among you eat blood. 

{17:13} And whatsoever man [there be]of the children of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn among you,which hunteth and catcheth any beast or fowl that may be eaten; heshall even pour out the blood thereof, and cover it with dust. 

{17:14}For [it is] the life of all flesh; the blood of it [is] for the lifethereof: therefore I said unto the children of Israel, Ye shall eat theblood of no manner of flesh: for the life of all flesh [is] the bloodthereof: whosoever eateth it shall be cut off. 

{17:15} And every soulthat eateth that which died [of itself,] or that which was torn [withbeasts, whether it be] one of your own country, or a stranger, he shallboth wash his clothes, and bathe [himself] in water, and be uncleanuntil the even: then shall he be clean. 

{17:16} But if he wash [them]not, nor bathe his flesh; then he shall bear his iniquity.   

{18:1} And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 

{18:2} Speak unto thechildren of Israel, and say unto them, I am the LORD your God. 

{18:3}After the doings of the land of Egypt, wherein ye dwelt, shall ye notdo: and after the doings of the land of Canaan, whither I bring you,shall ye not do: neither shall ye walk in their ordinances. 

{18:4} Yeshall do my judgments, and keep mine ordinances, to walk therein: I[am] the LORD your God. 

{18:5} Ye shall therefore keep my statutes, andmy judgments: which if a man do, he shall live in them: I [am] the LORD.   

{18:6} None of you shall approach to any that is near of kin to him,to uncover [their] nakedness: I [am] the LORD. 

{18:7} The nakedness ofthy father, or the nakedness of thy mother, shalt thou not uncover: sheis thy mother; thou shalt not uncover her nakedness. 

{18:8} Thenakedness of thy father's wife shalt thou not uncover: it is thyfather's nakedness. 

{18:9} The nakedness of thy sister, the daughter ofthy father, or daughter of thy mother, [whether she be] born at home,or born abroad, [even] their nakedness thou shalt not uncover. 

{18:10}The nakedness of thy son's daughter, or of thy daughter's daughter,[even] their nakedness thou shalt not uncover: for theirs [is] thineown nakedness. 

{18:11} The nakedness of thy father's wife's daughter,begotten of thy father, she [is] thy sister, thou shalt not uncover hernakedness. 

{18:12} Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father'ssister: she [is] thy father's near kinswoman. 

{18:13} Thou shalt notuncover the nakedness of thy mother's sister: for she [is] thy mother'snear kinswoman. 

{18:14} Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thyfather's brother, thou shalt not approach to his wife: she [is] thineaunt. 

{18:15} Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy daughter inlaw: she [is] thy son's wife; thou shalt not uncover her nakedness.

{18:16} Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy brother's wife: it[is] thy brother's nakedness. 

{18:17} Thou shalt not uncover thenakedness of a woman and her daughter, neither shalt thou take herson's daughter, or her daughter's daughter, to uncover her nakedness;[for] they [are] her near kinswomen: it [is] wickedness. 

{18:18}Neither shalt thou take a wife to her sister, to vex [her,] to uncoverher nakedness, beside the other in her life [time. ]

{18:19} Also thoushalt not approach unto a woman to uncover her nakedness, as long asshe is put apart for her uncleanness. 

{18:20} Moreover thou shalt notlie carnally with thy neighbour's wife, to defile thyself with her.

{18:21} And thou shalt not let any of thy seed pass through [the fire]to Molech, neither shalt thou profane the name of thy God: I [am] theLORD. 

{18:22} Thou shalt not lie with mankind, as with womankind: it[is] abomination. 

{18:23} Neither shalt thou lie with any beast todefile thyself therewith: neither shall any woman stand before a beastto lie down thereto: it [is] confusion. 

{18:24} Defile not yeyourselves in any of these things: for in all these the nations aredefiled which I cast out before you: 

{18:25} And the land is defiled:therefore I do visit the iniquity thereof upon it, and the land itselfvomiteth out her inhabitants. 

{18:26} Ye shall therefore keep mystatutes and my judgments, and shall not commit [any] of theseabominations; [neither] any of your own nation, nor any stranger thatsojourneth among you: 

{18:27} (For all these abominations have the menof the land done, which [were] before you, and the land is defiled;)

{18:28} That the land spue not you out also, when ye defile it, as itspued out the nations that [were] before you. 

{18:29} For whosoevershall commit any of these abominations, even the souls that commit[them] shall be cut off from among their people. 

{18:30} Thereforeshall ye keep mine ordinance, that [ye] commit not [any one] of theseabominable customs, which were committed before you, and that ye defilenot yourselves therein: I [am] the LORD your God.   

{19:1} And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 

{19:2} Speak unto allthe congregation of the children of Israel, and say unto them, Ye shallbe holy: for I the LORD your God [am] holy.   

{19:3} Ye shall fear every man his mother, and his father, and keepmy sabbaths: I [am] the LORD your God.   

{19:4} Turn ye not unto idols, nor make to yourselves molten gods: I[am] the LORD your God.   

{19:5} And if ye offer a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the LORD,ye shall offer it at your own will. 

{19:6} It shall be eaten the sameday ye offer it, and on the morrow: and if ought remain until the thirdday, it shall be burnt in the fire. 

{19:7} And if it be eaten at all onthe third day, it [is] abominable; it shall not be accepted. 

{19:8}Therefore [every one] that eateth it shall bear his iniquity, becausehe hath profaned the hallowed thing of the LORD: and that soul shall becut off from among his people.   

{19:9} And when ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt notwholly reap the corners of thy field, neither shalt thou gather thegleanings of thy harvest. 

{19:10} And thou shalt not glean thyvineyard, neither shalt thou gather [every] grape of thy vineyard; thoushalt leave them for the poor and stranger: I [am] the LORD your God.   

{19:11} Ye shall not steal, neither deal falsely, neither lie one toanother.   

{19:12} And ye shall not swear by my name falsely, neither shaltthou profane the name of thy God: I [am] the LORD.   

{19:13} Thou shalt not defraud thy neighbour, neither rob [him:] thewages of him that is hired shall not abide with thee all night untilthe morning.   

{19:14} Thou shalt not curse the deaf, nor put a stumblingblockbefore the blind, but shalt fear thy God: I [am] the LORD.   

{19:15} Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment: thou shalt notrespect the person of the poor, nor honour the person of the mighty:[but] in righteousness shalt thou judge thy neighbour.   

{19:16} Thou shalt not go up and down [as] a talebearer among thypeople: neither shalt thou stand against the blood of thy neighbour: I[am] the LORD.   

{19:17} Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thine heart: thou shaltin any wise rebuke thy neighbour, and not suffer sin upon him.   

{19:18} Thou shalt not avenge, nor bear any grudge against thechildren of thy people, but thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself: I[am] the LORD.   

{19:19} Ye shall keep my statutes. Thou shalt not let thy cattlegender with a diverse kind: thou shalt not sow thy field with mingledseed: neither shall a garment mingled of linen and woollen come uponthee.   

{19:20} And whosoever lieth carnally with a woman, that [is] abondmaid, betrothed to an husband, and not at all redeemed, nor freedomgiven her; she shall be scourged; they shall not be put to death,because she was not free. 

{19:21} And he shall bring his trespassoffering unto the LORD, unto the door of the tabernacle of thecongregation, [even] a ram for a trespass offering. 

{19:22} And thepriest shall make an atonement for him with the ram of the trespassoffering before the LORD for his sin which he hath done: and the sinwhich he hath done shall be forgiven him.   

{19:23} And when ye shall come into the land, and shall have plantedall manner of trees for food, then ye shall count the fruit thereof asuncircumcised: three years shall it be as uncircumcised unto you: itshall not be eaten of. 

{19:24} But in the fourth year all the fruitthereof shall be holy to praise the LORD [withal. ]

{19:25} And in thefifth year shall ye eat of the fruit thereof, that it may yield untoyou the increase thereof: I [am] the LORD your God.   

{19:26} Ye shall not eat [any thing] with the blood: neither shallye use enchantment, nor observe times. 

{19:27} Ye shall not round thecorners of your heads, neither shalt thou mar the corners of thy beard.

{19:28} Ye shall not make any cuttings in your flesh for the dead, norprint any marks upon you: I [am] the LORD.   

{19:29} Do not prostitute thy daughter, to cause her to be a whore;lest the land fall to whoredom, and the land become full of wickedness.   

{19:30} Ye shall keep my sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary: I[am] the LORD.   

{19:31} Regard not them that have familiar spirits, neither seekafter wizards, to be defiled by them: I [am] the LORD your God.   

{19:32} Thou shalt rise up before the hoary head, and honour theface of the old man, and fear thy God: I [am] the LORD.   

{19:33} And if a stranger sojourn with thee in your land, ye shallnot vex him. 

{19:34} [But] the stranger that dwelleth with you shall beunto you as one born among you, and thou shalt love him as thyself; forye were strangers in the land of Egypt: I [am] the LORD your God.   

{19:35} Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment, in meteyard, inweight, or in measure. 

{19:36} Just balances, just weights, a justephah, and a just hin, shall ye have: I [am] the LORD your God, whichbrought you out of the land of Egypt. 

{19:37} Therefore shall yeobserve all my statutes, and all my judgments, and do them: I [am] theLORD.   

{20:1} And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 

{20:2} Again, thoushalt say to the children of Israel, Whosoever [he be] of the childrenof Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn in Israel, that giveth[any] of his seed unto Molech; he shall surely be put to death: thepeople of the land shall stone him with stones. 

{20:3} And I will setmy face against that man, and will cut him off from among his people;because he hath given of his seed unto Molech, to defile my sanctuary,and to profane my holy name. 

{20:4} And if the people of the land doany ways hide their eyes from the man, when he giveth of his seed untoMolech, and kill him not: 

{20:5} Then I will set my face against thatman, and against his family, and will cut him off, and all that go awhoring after him, to commit whoredom with Molech, from among theirpeople.   

{20:6} And the soul that turneth after such as have familiarspirits, and after wizards, to go a whoring after them, I will even setmy face against that soul, and will cut him off from among his people.   

{20:7} Sanctify yourselves therefore, and be ye holy: for I [am] theLORD your God. 

{20:8} And ye shall keep my statutes, and do them: I[am] the LORD which sanctify you.   

{20:9} For every one that curseth his father or his mother shall besurely put to death: he hath cursed his father or his mother; his blood[shall be] upon him.   

{20:10} And the man that committeth adultery with [another] man'swife, [even he] that committeth adultery with his neighbour's wife, theadulterer and the adulteress shall surely be put to death. 

{20:11} Andthe man that lieth with his father's wife hath uncovered his father'snakedness: both of them shall surely be put to death; their blood[shall be] upon them. 

{20:12} And if a man lie with his daughter inlaw, both of them shall surely be put to death: they have wroughtconfusion; their blood [shall be] upon them. 

{20:13} If a man also liewith mankind, as he lieth with a woman, both of them have committed anabomination: they shall surely be put to death; their blood [shall be]upon them. 

{20:14} And if a man take a wife and her mother, it [is]wickedness: they shall be burnt with fire, both he and they; that therebe no wickedness among you. 

{20:15} And if a man lie with a beast, heshall surely be put to death: and ye shall slay the beast. 

{20:16} Andif a woman approach unto any beast, and lie down thereto, thou shaltkill the woman, and the beast: they shall surely be put to death; theirblood [shall be] upon them. 

{20:17} And if a man shall take his sister,his father's daughter, or his mother's daughter, and see her nakedness,and she see his nakedness; it [is] a wicked thing; and they shall becut off in the sight of their people: he hath uncovered his sister'snakedness; he shall bear his iniquity. 

{20:18} And if a man shall liewith a woman having her sickness, and shall uncover her nakedness; hehath discovered her fountain, and she hath uncovered the fountain ofher blood: and both of them shall be cut off from among their people.

{20:19} And thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy mother'ssister, nor of thy father's sister: for he uncovereth his near kin:they shall bear their iniquity. 

{20:20} And if a man shall lie with hisuncle's wife, he hath uncovered his uncle's nakedness: they shall beartheir sin; they shall die childless. 

{20:21} And if a man shall takehis brother's wife, it [is] an unclean thing: he hath uncovered hisbrother's nakedness; they shall be childless.   

{20:22} Ye shall therefore keep all my statutes, and all myjudgments, and do them: that the land, whither I bring you to dwelltherein, spue you not out. 

{20:23} And ye shall not walk in the mannersof the nation, which I cast out before you: for they committed allthese things, and therefore I abhorred them. 

{20:24} But I have saidunto you, Ye shall inherit their land, and I will give it unto you topossess it, a land that floweth with milk and honey: I [am] the LORDyour God, which have separated you from [other] people. 

{20:25} Yeshall therefore put difference between clean beasts and unclean, andbetween unclean fowls and clean: and ye shall not make your soulsabominable by beast, or by fowl, or by any manner of living thing thatcreepeth on the ground, which I have separated from you as unclean.

{20:26} And ye shall be holy unto me: for I the LORD [am] holy, andhave severed you from [other] people, that ye should be mine.   

{20:27} A man also or woman that hath a familiar spirit, or that isa wizard, shall surely be put to death: they shall stone them withstones: their blood [shall be] upon them.   

{21:1} And the LORD said unto Moses, Speak unto the priests the sonsof Aaron, and say unto them, There shall none be defiled for the deadamong his people: 

{21:2} But for his kin, that is near unto him, [thatis,] for his mother, and for his father, and for his son, and for hisdaughter, and for his brother, 

{21:3} And for his sister a virgin, thatis nigh unto him, which hath had no husband; for her may he be defiled.

{21:4} [But] he shall not defile himself, [being] a chief man among hispeople, to profane himself. 

{21:5} They shall not make baldness upontheir head, neither shall they shave off the corner of their beard, normake any cuttings in their flesh. 

{21:6} They shall be holy unto theirGod, and not profane the name of their God: for the offerings of theLORD made by fire, [and] the bread of their God, they do offer:therefore they shall be holy. 

{21:7} They shall not take a wife [thatis] a whore, or profane; neither shall they take a woman put away fromher husband: for he [is] holy unto his God. 

{21:8} Thou shalt sanctifyhim therefore; for he offereth the bread of thy God: he shall be holyunto thee: for I the LORD, which sanctify you, [am] holy.   

{21:9} And the daughter of any priest, if she profane herself byplaying the whore, she profaneth her father: she shall be burnt withfire. 

{21:10} And [he that is] the high priest among his brethren, uponwhose head the anointing oil was poured, and that is consecrated to puton the garments, shall not uncover his head, nor rend his clothes;

{21:11} Neither shall he go in to any dead body, nor defile himself forhis father, or for his mother; 

{21:12} Neither shall he go out of thesanctuary, nor profane the sanctuary of his God; for the crown of theanointing oil of his God [is] upon him: I [am] the LORD. 

{21:13} And heshall take a wife in her virginity. 

{21:14} A widow, or a divorcedwoman, or profane, [or] an harlot, these shall he not take: but heshall take a virgin of his own people to wife. 

{21:15} Neither shall heprofane his seed among his people: for I the LORD do sanctify him.   

{21:16} And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 

{21:17} Speak untoAaron, saying, Whosoever [he be] of thy seed in their generations thathath [any] blemish, let him not approach to offer the bread of his God.

{21:18} For whatsoever man [he be] that hath a blemish, he shall notapproach: a blind man, or a lame, or he that hath a flat nose, or anything superfluous, 

{21:19} Or a man that is brokenfooted, orbrokenhanded, 

{21:20} Or crookbackt, or a dwarf, or that hath a blemishin his eye, or be scurvy, or scabbed, or hath his stones broken;

{21:21} No man that hath a blemish of the seed of Aaron the priestshall come nigh to offer the offerings of the LORD made by fire: hehath a blemish; he shall not come nigh to offer the bread of his God.

{21:22} He shall eat the bread of his God, [both] of the most holy, andof the holy. 

{21:23} Only he shall not go in unto the vail, nor comenigh unto the altar, because he hath a blemish; that he profane not mysanctuaries: for I the LORD do sanctify them. 

{21:24} And Moses told[it] unto Aaron, and to his sons, and unto all the children of Israel.   

{22:1} And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 

{22:2} Speak untoAaron and to his sons, that they separate themselves from the holythings of the children of Israel, and that they profane not my holyname [in those things] which they hallow unto me: I [am] the LORD.

{22:3} Say unto them, Whosoever [he be] of all your seed among yourgenerations, that goeth unto the holy things, which the children ofIsrael hallow unto the LORD, having his uncleanness upon him, that soulshall be cut off from my presence: I [am] the LORD. 

{22:4} What mansoever of the seed of Aaron [is] a leper, or hath a running issue; heshall not eat of the holy things, until he be clean. And whoso touchethany thing [that is] unclean [by] the dead, or a man whose seed goethfrom him; 

{22:5} Or whosoever toucheth any creeping thing, whereby hemay be made unclean, or a man of whom he may take uncleanness,whatsoever uncleanness he hath; 

{22:6} The soul which hath touched anysuch shall be unclean until even, and shall not eat of the holy things,unless he wash his flesh with water. 

{22:7} And when the sun is down,he shall be clean, and shall afterward eat of the holy things; becauseit [is] his food. 

{22:8} That which dieth of itself, or is torn [withbeasts,] he shall not eat to defile himself therewith: I [am] the LORD.

{22:9} They shall therefore keep mine ordinance, lest they bear sin forit, and die therefore, if they profane it: I the LORD do sanctify them.

{22:10} There shall no stranger eat [of] the holy thing: a sojourner ofthe priest, or an hired servant, shall not eat [of] the holy thing.

{22:11} But if the priest buy [any] soul with his money, he shall eatof it, and he that is born in his house: they shall eat of his meat.

{22:12} If the priest's daughter also be [married] unto a stranger, shemay not eat of an offering of the holy things. 

{22:13} But if thepriest's daughter be a widow, or divorced, and have no child, and isreturned unto her father's house, as in her youth, she shall eat of herfather's meat: but there shall no stranger eat thereof.   

{22:14} And if a man eat [of] the holy thing unwittingly, then heshall put the fifth [part] thereof unto it, and shall give [it] untothe priest with the holy thing. 

{22:15} And they shall not profane theholy things of the children of Israel, which they offer unto the LORD;

{22:16} Or suffer them to bear the iniquity of trespass, when they eattheir holy things: for I the LORD do sanctify them.   

{22:17} And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 

{22:18} Speak untoAaron, and to his sons, and unto all the children of Israel, and sayunto them, Whatsoever [he be] of the house of Israel, or of thestrangers in Israel, that will offer his oblation for all his vows, andfor all his freewill offerings, which they will offer unto the LORD fora burnt offering; 

{22:19} [Ye shall offer] at your own will a malewithout blemish, of the beeves, of the sheep, or of the goats. 

{22:20}[But] whatsoever hath a blemish, [that] shall ye not offer: for itshall not be acceptable for you. 

{22:21} And whosoever offereth asacrifice of peace offerings unto the LORD to accomplish [his] vow, ora freewill offering in beeves or sheep, it shall be perfect to beaccepted; there shall be no blemish therein. 

{22:22} Blind, or broken,or maimed, or having a wen, or scurvy, or scabbed, ye shall not offerthese unto the LORD, nor make an offering by fire of them upon thealtar unto the LORD. 

{22:23} Either a bullock or a lamb that hath anything superfluous or lacking in his parts, that mayest thou offer [for]a freewill offering; but for a vow it shall not be accepted. 

{22:24} Yeshall not offer unto the LORD that which is bruised, or crushed, orbroken, or cut; neither shall ye make [any offering thereof] in yourland. 

{22:25} Neither from a stranger's hand shall ye offer the breadof your God of any of these; because their corruption [is] in them,[and] blemishes [be] in them: they shall not be accepted for you.   

{22:26} And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 

{22:27} When abullock, or a sheep, or a goat, is brought forth, then it shall beseven days under the dam; and from the eighth day and thenceforth itshall be accepted for an offering made by fire unto the LORD. 

{22:28}And [whether it be] cow or ewe, ye shall not kill it and her young bothin one day. 

{22:29} And when ye will offer a sacrifice of thanksgivingunto the LORD, offer [it] at your own will. 

{22:30} On the same day itshall be eaten up; ye shall leave none of it until the morrow: I [am]the LORD. 

{22:31} Therefore shall ye keep my commandments, and do them:I [am] the LORD. 

{22:32} Neither shall ye profane my holy name; but Iwill be hallowed among the children of Israel: I [am] the LORD whichhallow you, 

{22:33} That brought you out of the land of Egypt, to beyour God: I [am] the LORD.   

{23:1} And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 

{23:2} Speak unto thechildren of Israel, and say unto them, [Concerning] the feasts of theLORD, which ye shall proclaim [to be] holy convocations, [even] these[are] my feasts. 

{23:3} Six days shall work be done: but the seventhday [is] the sabbath of rest, an holy convocation; ye shall do no work[therein:] it [is] the sabbath of the LORD in all your dwellings.   

{23:4} These [are] the feasts of the LORD, [even] holy convocations,which ye shall proclaim in their seasons. 

{23:5} In the fourteenth[day] of the first month at even [is] the LORD'S passover. 

{23:6} Andon the fifteenth day of the same month [is] the feast of unleavenedbread unto the LORD: seven days ye must eat unleavened bread. 

{23:7} Inthe first day ye shall have an holy convocation: ye shall do no servilework therein. 

{23:8} But ye shall offer an offering made by fire untothe LORD seven days: in the seventh day [is] an holy convocation: yeshall do no servile work [therein.]   

{23:9} And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 

{23:10} Speak unto thechildren of Israel, and say unto them, When ye be come into the landwhich I give unto you, and shall reap the harvest thereof, then yeshall bring a sheaf of the firstfruits of your harvest unto the priest:

{23:11} And he shall wave the sheaf before the LORD, to be accepted foryou: on the morrow after the sabbath the priest shall wave it. 

{23:12}And ye shall offer that day when ye wave the sheaf an he lamb withoutblemish of the first year for a burnt offering unto the LORD. 

{23:13}And the meat offering thereof [shall be] two tenth deals of fine flourmingled with oil, an offering made by fire unto the LORD [for] a sweetsavour: and the drink offering thereof [shall be] of wine, the fourth[part] of an hin. 

{23:14} And ye shall eat neither bread, nor parchedcorn, nor green ears, until the selfsame day that ye have brought anoffering unto your God: [it shall be] a statute for ever throughoutyour generations in all your dwellings.   

{23:15} And ye shall count unto you from the morrow after thesabbath, from the day that ye brought the sheaf of the wave offering;seven sabbaths shall be complete: 

{23:16} Even unto the morrow afterthe seventh sabbath shall ye number fifty days; and ye shall offer anew meat offering unto the LORD. 

{23:17} Ye shall bring out of yourhabitations two wave loaves of two tenth deals: they shall be of fineflour; they shall be baken with leaven; [they are] the firstfruits untothe LORD. 

{23:18} And ye shall offer with the bread seven lambs withoutblemish of the first year, and one young bullock, and two rams: theyshall be [for] a burnt offering unto the LORD, with their meatoffering, and their drink offerings, [even] an offering made by fire,of sweet savour unto the LORD. 

{23:19} Then ye shall sacrifice one kidof the goats for a sin offering, and two lambs of the first year for asacrifice of peace offerings. 

{23:20} And the priest shall wave themwith the bread of the first fruits [for] a wave offering before theLORD, with the two lambs: they shall be holy to the LORD for thepriest. 

{23:21} And ye shall proclaim on the selfsame day, [that] itmay be an holy convocation unto you: ye shall do no servile work[therein: it shall be] a statute for ever in all your dwellingsthroughout your generations.   

{23:22} And when ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt notmake clean riddance of the corners of thy field when thou reapest,neither shalt thou gather any gleaning of thy harvest: thou shalt leavethem unto the poor, and to the stranger: I [am] the LORD your God.   

{23:23} And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 

{23:24} Speak untothe children of Israel, saying, In the seventh month, in the first[day] of the month, shall ye have a sabbath, a memorial of blowing oftrumpets, an holy convocation. 

{23:25} Ye shall do no servile work[therein:] but ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD.   

{23:26} And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 

{23:27} Also on thetenth [day] of this seventh month [there shall be] a day of atonement:it shall be an holy convocation unto you; and ye shall afflict yoursouls, and offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD. 

{23:28} And yeshall do no work in that same day: for it [is] a day of atonement, tomake an atonement for you before the LORD your God. 

{23:29} Forwhatsoever soul [it be] that shall not be afflicted in that same day,he shall be cut off from among his people. 

{23:30} And whatsoever soul[it be] that doeth any work in that same day, the same soul will Idestroy from among his people. 

{23:31} Ye shall do no manner of work:[it shall be] a statute for ever throughout your generations in allyour dwellings. 

{23:32} It [shall be] unto you a sabbath of rest, andye shall afflict your souls: in the ninth [day] of the month at even,from even unto even, shall ye celebrate your sabbath.   

{23:33} And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

{23:44} And Moses declaredunto the children of Israel the feasts of the LORD.   

{24:1} And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 

{24:2} Command thechildren of Israel, that they bring unto thee pure oil olive beaten forthe light, to cause the lamps to burn continually.

{24:6} And thou shaltset them in two rows, six on a row, upon the pure table before theLORD. 

{24:7} And thou shalt put pure frankincense upon [each] row, thatit may be on the bread for a memorial, [even] an offering made by fireunto the LORD. 

{24:8} Every sabbath he shall set it in order before theLORD continually, [being taken] from the children of Israel by aneverlasting covenant. 

{24:9} And it shall be Aaron's and his sons'; andthey shall eat it in the holy place: for it [is] most holy unto him ofthe offerings of the LORD made by fire by a perpetual statute.   

{24:10} And the son of an Israelitish woman, whose father [was] anEgyptian, went out among the children of Israel: and this son of theIsraelitish [woman] and a man of Israel strove together in the camp;

{24:11} And the Israelitish woman's son blasphemed the name [of theLORD,] and cursed. And they brought him unto Moses: (and his mother'sname [was] Shelomith, the daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan:)

{24:12} And they put him in ward, that the mind of the LORD might beshewed them. 

{24:13} And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 

{24:14}Bring forth him that hath cursed without the camp; and let all thatheard [him] lay their hands upon his head, and let all the congregationstone him. 

{24:15} And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel,saying, Whosoever curseth his God shall bear his sin. 

{24:16} And hethat blasphemeth the name of the LORD, he shall surely be put to death,[and] all the congregation shall certainly stone him: as well thestranger, as he that is born in the land, when he blasphemeth the name[of the LORD,] shall be put to death.   

{24:17} And he that killeth any man shall surely be put to death.

{24:18} And he that killeth a beast shall make it good; beast forbeast. 

{24:19} And if a man cause a blemish in his neighbour; as hehath done, so shall it be done to him; 

{24:20} Breach for breach, eyefor eye, tooth for tooth: as he hath caused a blemish in a man, soshall it be done to him [again. ]

{24:21} And he that killeth a beast,he shall restore it: and he that killeth a man, he shall be put todeath. 

{24:22} Ye shall have one manner of law, as well for thestranger, as for one of your own country: for I [am] the LORD your God.   

{24:23} And Moses spake to the children of Israel, that they shouldbring forth him that had cursed out of the camp, and stone him withstones. And the children of Israel did as the LORD commanded Moses.   

{25:1} And the LORD spake unto Moses in mount Sinai, saying, 

{25:2}Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye come intothe land which I give you, then shall the land keep a sabbath unto theLORD. 

{25:3} Six years thou shalt sow thy field, and six years thoushalt prune thy vineyard, and gather in the fruit thereof; 

{25:4} Butin the seventh year shall be a sabbath of rest unto the land, a sabbathfor the LORD: thou shalt neither sow thy field, nor prune thy vineyard.

{25:5} That which groweth of its own accord of thy harvest thou shaltnot reap, neither gather the grapes of thy vine undressed: [for] it isa year of rest unto the land. 

{25:6} And the sabbath of the land shallbe meat for you; for thee, and for thy servant, and for thy maid, andfor thy hired servant, and for thy stranger that sojourneth with thee,

{25:7} And for thy cattle, and for the beast that [are] in thy land,shall all the increase thereof be meat.   

{25:8} And thou shalt number seven sabbaths of years unto thee,seven times seven years; and the space of the seven sabbaths of yearsshall be unto thee forty and nine years. 

{25:9} Then shalt thou causethe trumpet of the jubile to sound on the tenth [day] of the seventhmonth, in the day of atonement shall ye make the trumpet soundthroughout all your land. 

{25:10} And ye shall hallow the fiftiethyear, and proclaim liberty throughout [all] the land unto all theinhabitants thereof: it shall be a jubile unto you; and ye shall returnevery man unto his possession, and ye shall return every man unto hisfamily. 

{25:11} A jubile shall that fiftieth year be unto you: ye shallnot sow, neither reap that which groweth of itself in it, nor gather[the grapes] in it of thy vine undressed. 

{25:12} For it [is] thejubile; it shall be holy unto you: ye shall eat the increase thereofout of the field. 

{25:13} In the year of this jubile ye shall returnevery man unto his possession. 

{25:14} And if thou sell [ought] untothy neighbour, or buyest ought of thy neighbour's hand, ye shall notoppress one another: 

{25:15} According to the number of years after thejubile thou shalt buy of thy neighbour, [and] according unto the numberof years of the fruits he shall sell unto thee: 

{25:16} According tothe multitude of years thou shalt increase the price thereof, andaccording to the fewness of years thou shalt diminish the price of it:for [according] to the number [of the years] of the fruits doth he sellunto thee. 

{25:17} Ye shall not therefore oppress one another; but thoushalt fear thy God: for I [am] the LORD your God.   

{25:18} Wherefore ye shall do my statutes, and keep my judgments,and do them; and ye shall dwell in the land in safety. 

{25:19} And theland shall yield her fruit, and ye shall eat your fill, and dwelltherein in safety. 

{25:20} And if ye shall say, What shall we eat theseventh year? behold, we shall not sow, nor gather in our increase:

{25:21} Then I will command my blessing upon you in the sixth year, andit shall bring forth fruit for three years. 

{25:22} And ye shall sowthe eighth year, and eat [yet] of old fruit until the ninth year; untilher fruits come in ye shall eat [of] the old [store.]   

{25:23} The land shall not be sold for ever: for the land [is] mine;for ye [are] strangers and sojourners with me. 

{25:24} And in all theland of your possession ye shall grant a redemption for the land.   

{25:25} If thy brother be waxen poor, and hath sold away [some] ofhis possession, and if any of his kin come to redeem it, then shall heredeem that which his brother sold. 

{25:26} And if the man have none toredeem it, and himself be able to redeem it; 

{25:27} Then let him countthe years of the sale thereof, and restore the overplus unto the man towhom he sold it; that he may return unto his possession. 

{25:28} But ifhe be not able to restore [it] to him, then that which is sold shallremain in the hand of him that hath bought it until the year of jubile:and in the jubile it shall go out, and he shall return unto hispossession. 

{25:29} And if a man sell a dwelling house in a walledcity, then he may redeem it within a whole year after it is sold;[within] a full year may he redeem it. 

{25:30} And if it be notredeemed within the space of a full year, then the house that [is] inthe walled city shall be established for ever to him that bought itthroughout his generations: it shall not go out in the jubile. 

{25:31}But the houses of the villages which have no wall round about themshall be counted as the fields of the country: they may be redeemed,and they shall go out in the jubile. 

{25:32} Notwithstanding the citiesof the Levites, [and] the houses of the cities of their possession, maythe Levites redeem at any time. 

{25:33} And if a man purchase of theLevites, then the house that was sold, and the city of his possession,shall go out in [the year of] jubile: for the houses of the cities ofthe Levites [are] their possession among the children of Israel.

{25:34} But the field of the suburbs of their cities may not be sold;for it is their perpetual possession.   

{25:35} And if thy brother be waxen poor, and fallen in decay withthee; then thou shalt relieve him: [yea, though he be] a stranger, or asojourner; that he may live with thee. 

{25:36} Take thou no usury ofhim, or increase: but fear thy God; that thy brother may live withthee. 

{25:37} Thou shalt not give him thy money upon usury, nor lendhim thy victuals for increase. 

{25:38} I [am] the LORD your God, whichbrought you forth out of the land of Egypt, to give you the land ofCanaan, [and] to be your God.   

{25:39} And if thy brother [that dwelleth] by thee be waxen poor,and be sold unto thee; thou shalt not compel him to serve as abondservant: 

{25:40} [But] as an hired servant, [and] as a sojourner,he shall be with thee, [and] shall serve thee unto the year of jubile:

{25:41} And [then] shall he depart from thee, [both] he and hischildren with him, and shall return unto his own family, and unto thepossession of his fathers shall he return. 

{25:42} For they [are] myservants, which I brought forth out of the land of Egypt: they shallnot be sold as bondmen. 

{25:43} Thou shalt not rule over him withrigour; but shalt fear thy God. 

{25:44} Both thy bondmen, and thybondmaids, which thou shalt have, [shall be] of the heathen that areround about you; of them shall ye buy bondmen and bondmaids. 

{25:45}Moreover of the children of the strangers that do sojourn among you, ofthem shall ye buy, and of their families that [are] with you, whichthey begat in your land: and they shall be your possession. 

{25:46} Andye shall take them as an inheritance for your children after you, toinherit [them for] a possession; they shall be your bondmen for ever:but over your brethren the children of Israel, ye shall not rule oneover another with rigour.   

{25:47} And if a sojourner or stranger wax rich by thee, and thybrother [that dwelleth] by him wax poor, and sell himself unto thestranger [or] sojourner by thee, or to the stock of the stranger'sfamily: 

{25:48} After that he is sold he may be redeemed again; one ofhis brethren may redeem him: 

{25:49} Either his uncle, or his uncle'sson, may redeem him, or [any] that is nigh of kin unto him of hisfamily may redeem him; or if he be able, he may redeem himself. 

{25:50}And he shall reckon with him that bought him from the year that he wassold to him unto the year of jubile: and the price of his sale shall beaccording unto the number of years, according to the time of an hiredservant shall it be with him. 

{25:51} If [there be] yet many years[behind,] according unto them he shall give again the price of hisredemption out of the money that he was bought for. 

{25:52} And ifthere remain but few years unto the year of jubile, then he shall countwith him, [and] according unto his years shall he give him again theprice of his redemption. 

{25:53} [And] as a yearly hired servant shallhe be with him: [and the other] shall not rule with rigour over him inthy sight. 

{25:54} And if he be not redeemed in these [years,] then heshall go out in the year of jubile, [both] he, and his children withhim. 

{25:55} For unto me the children of Israel [are] servants; they[are] my servants whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt: I [am]the LORD your God.   

{26:1} Ye shall make you no idols nor graven image, neither rear youup a standing image, neither shall ye set up [any] image of stone inyour land, to bow down unto it: for I [am] the LORD your God.   

{26:2} Ye shall keep my sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary: I [am]the LORD.   

{26:3} If ye walk in my statutes, and keep my commandments, and dothem; 

{26:4} Then I will give you rain in due season, and the landshall yield her increase, and the trees of the field shall yield theirfruit. 

{26:5} And your threshing shall reach unto the vintage, and thevintage shall reach unto the sowing time: and ye shall eat your breadto the full, and dwell in your land safely. 

{26:6} And I will givepeace in the land, and ye shall lie down, and none shall make [you]afraid: and I will rid evil beasts out of the land, neither shall thesword go through your land. 

{26:7} And ye shall chase your enemies, andthey shall fall before you by the sword. 

{26:8} And five of you shallchase an hundred, and an hundred of you shall put ten thousand toflight: and your enemies shall fall before you by the sword. 

{26:9} ForI will have respect unto you, and make you fruitful, and multiply you,and establish my covenant with you. 

{26:10} And ye shall eat old store,and bring forth the old because of the new. 

{26:11} And I will set mytabernacle among you: and my soul shall not abhor you. 

{26:12} And Iwill walk among you, and will be your God, and ye shall be my people.

{26:13} I [am] the LORD your God, which brought you forth out of theland of Egypt, that ye should not be their bondmen; and I have brokenthe bands of your yoke, and made you go upright.   

{26:14} But if ye will not hearken unto me, and will not do allthese commandments; 

{26:15} And if ye shall despise my statutes, or ifyour soul abhor my judgments, so that ye will not do all mycommandments, [but] that ye break my covenant: 

{26:16} I also will dothis unto you; I will even appoint over you terror, consumption, andthe burning ague, that shall consume the eyes, and cause sorrow ofheart: and ye shall sow your seed in vain, for your enemies shall eatit. 

{26:17} And I will set my face against you, and ye shall be slainbefore your enemies: they that hate you shall reign over you; and yeshall flee when none pursueth you. 

{26:18} And if ye will not yet forall this hearken unto me, then I will punish you seven times more foryour sins. 

{26:19} And I will break the pride of your power; and I willmake your heaven as iron, and your earth as brass: 

{26:20} And yourstrength shall be spent in vain: for your land shall not yield herincrease, neither shall the trees of the land yield their fruits.   

{26:21} And if ye walk contrary unto me, and will not hearken untome; I will bring seven times more plagues upon you according to yoursins. 

{26:22} I will also send wild beasts among you, which shall robyou of your children, and destroy your cattle, and make you few innumber; and your [high] ways shall be desolate. 

{26:23} And if ye willnot be reformed by me by these things, but will walk contrary unto me;

{26:24} Then will I also walk contrary unto you, and will punish youyet seven times for your sins. 

{26:25} And I will bring a sword uponyou, that shall avenge the quarrel of [my] covenant: and when ye aregathered together within your cities, I will send the pestilence amongyou; and ye shall be delivered into the hand of the enemy. 

{26:26}[And] when I have broken the staff of your bread, ten women shall bakeyour bread in one oven, and they shall deliver [you] your bread againby weight: and ye shall eat, and not be satisfied. 

{26:27} And if yewill not for all this hearken unto me, but walk contrary unto me;

{26:28} Then I will walk contrary unto you also in fury; and I, even I,will chastise you seven times for your sins. 

{26:29} And ye shall eatthe flesh of your sons, and the flesh of your daughters shall ye eat.

{26:30} And I will destroy your high places, and cut down your images,and cast your carcases upon the carcases of your idols, and my soulshall abhor you. 

{26:31} And I will make your cities waste, and bringyour sanctuaries unto desolation, and I will not smell the savour ofyour sweet odours. 

{26:32} And I will bring the land into desolation:and your enemies which dwell therein shall be astonished at it. 

{26:33}And I will scatter you among the heathen, and will draw out a swordafter you: and your land shall be desolate, and your cities waste.

{26:34} Then shall the land enjoy her sabbaths, as long as it liethdesolate, and ye be in your enemies' land; [even] then shall the landrest, and enjoy her sabbaths. 

{26:35} As long as it lieth desolate itshall rest; because it did not rest in your sabbaths, when ye dweltupon it. 

{26:36} And upon them that are left [alive] of you I will senda faintness into their hearts in the lands of their enemies; and thesound of a shaken leaf shall chase them; and they shall flee, asfleeing from a sword; and they shall fall when none pursueth. 

{26:37}And they shall fall one upon another, as it were before a sword, whennone pursueth: and ye shall have no power to stand before your enemies.

{26:38} And ye shall perish among the heathen, and the land of yourenemies shall eat you up. 

{26:39} And they that are left of you shallpine away in their iniquity in your enemies' lands; and also in theiniquities of their fathers shall they pine away with them. 

{26:40} Ifthey shall confess their iniquity, and the iniquity of their fathers,with their trespass which they trespassed against me, and that alsothey have walked contrary unto me; 

{26:41} And [that] I also havewalked contrary unto them, and have brought them into the land of theirenemies; if then their uncircumcised hearts be humbled, and they thenaccept of the punishment of their iniquity: 

{26:42} Then will Iremember my covenant with Jacob, and also my covenant with Isaac, andalso my covenant with Abraham will I remember; and I will remember theland. 

{26:43} The land also shall be left of them, and shall enjoy hersabbaths, while she lieth desolate without them: and they shall acceptof the punishment of their iniquity: because, even because theydespised my judgments, and because their soul abhorred my statutes.

{26:44} And yet for all that, when they be in the land of theirenemies, I will not cast them away, neither will I abhor them, todestroy them utterly, and to break my covenant with them: for I [am]the LORD their God. 

{26:45} But I will for their sakes remember thecovenant of their ancestors, whom I brought forth out of the land ofEgypt in the sight of the heathen, that I might be their God: I [am]the LORD. 

{26:46} These [are] the statutes and judgments and laws,which the LORD made between him and the children of Israel in mountSinai by the hand of Moses.   

{27:1} And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 

{27:2} Speak unto thechildren of Israel, and say unto them, When a man shall make a singularvow, the persons [shall be] for the LORD by thy estimation. 

{27:3} Andthy estimation shall be of the male from twenty years old even untosixty years old, even thy estimation shall be fifty shekels of silver,after the shekel of the sanctuary. 

{27:4} And if it [be] a female, thenthy estimation shall be thirty shekels. 

{27:5} And if [it be] from fiveyears old even unto twenty years old, then thy estimation shall be ofthe male twenty shekels, and for the female ten shekels. 

{27:6} And if[it be] from a month old even unto five years old, then thy estimationshall be of the male five shekels of silver, and for the female thyestimation [shall be] three shekels of silver. 

{27:7} And if [it be]from sixty years old and above; if [it be] a male, then thy estimationshall be fifteen shekels, and for the female ten shekels. 

{27:8} But ifhe be poorer than thy estimation, then he shall present himself beforethe priest, and the priest shall value him; according to his abilitythat vowed shall the priest value him. 

{27:9} And if [it be] a beast,whereof men bring an offering unto the LORD, all that [any man] givethof such unto the LORD shall be holy. 

{27:10} He shall not alter it, norchange it, a good for a bad, or a bad for a good: and if he shall atall change beast for beast, then it and the exchange thereof shall beholy. 

{27:11} And if [it be] any unclean beast, of which they do notoffer a sacrifice unto the LORD, then he shall present the beast beforethe priest: 

{27:12} And the priest shall value it, whether it be goodor bad: as thou valuest it, [who art] the priest, so shall it be.

{27:13} But if he will at all redeem it, then he shall add a fifth[part] thereof unto thy estimation.   

{27:14} And when a man shall sanctify his house [to be] holy untothe LORD, then the priest shall estimate it, whether it be good or bad:as the priest shall estimate it, so shall it stand. 

{27:15} And if hethat sanctified it will redeem his house, then he shall add the fifth[part] of the money of thy estimation unto it, and it shall be his.

{27:16} And if a man shall sanctify unto the LORD [some part] of afield of his possession, then thy estimation shall be according to theseed thereof: an homer of barley seed [shall be valued] at fiftyshekels of silver. 

{27:17} If he sanctify his field from the year ofjubile, according to thy estimation it shall stand. 

{27:18} But if hesanctify his field after the jubile, then the priest shall reckon untohim the money according to the years that remain, even unto the year ofthe jubile, and it shall be abated from thy estimation. 

{27:19} And ifhe that sanctified the field will in any wise redeem it, then he shalladd the fifth [part] of the money of thy estimation unto it, and itshall be assured to him. 

{27:20} And if he will not redeem the field,or if he have sold the field to another man, it shall not be redeemedany more. 

{27:21} But the field, when it goeth out in the jubile, shallbe holy unto the LORD, as a field devoted; the possession thereof shallbe the priest's. 

{27:22} And if [a man] sanctify unto the LORD a fieldwhich he hath bought, which [is] not of the fields of his possession;

{27:23} Then the priest shall reckon unto him the worth of thyestimation, [even] unto the year of the jubile: and he shall give thineestimation in that day, [as] a holy thing unto the LORD. 

{27:24} In theyear of the jubile the field shall return unto him of whom it wasbought, [even] to him to whom the possession of the land [did belong.]

{27:25} And all thy estimations shall be according to the shekel ofthe sanctuary: twenty gerahs shall be the shekel.   

{27:26} Only the firstling of the beasts, which should be the LORD'Sfirstling, no man shall sanctify it; whether [it be] ox, or sheep: it[is] the LORD'S. 

{27:27} And if [it be] of an unclean beast, then heshall redeem it according to thine estimation, and shall add a fifth[part] of it thereto: or if it be not redeemed, then it shall be soldaccording to thy estimation. 

{27:28} Notwithstanding no devoted thing,that a man shall devote unto the LORD of all that he hath, [both] ofman and beast, and of the field of his possession, shall be sold orredeemed: every devoted thing [is] most holy unto the LORD. 

{27:29}None devoted, which shall be devoted of men, shall be redeemed; [but]shall surely be put to death. 

{27:30} And all the tithe of the land,[whether] of the seed of the land, [or] of the fruit of the tree, [is]the LORD'S: [it is] holy unto the LORD. 

{27:31} And if a man will atall redeem [ought] of his tithes, he shall add thereto the fifth [part]thereof. 

{27:32} And concerning the tithe of the herd, or of the flock,[even] of whatsoever passeth under the rod, the tenth shall be holyunto the LORD. 

{27:33} He shall not search whether it be good or bad,neither shall he change it: and if he change it at all, then both itand the change thereof shall be holy; it shall not be redeemed. 

{27:34}These [are] the commandments, which the LORD commanded Moses for thechildren of Israel in mount Sinai.
