{The Book of Daniel   

{1:1} In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah cameNebuchadnezzar king of Babylon unto Jerusalem, and besieged it. 

{1:2}And the Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, with part ofthe vessels of the house of God: which he carried into the land ofShinar to the house of his god; and he brought the vessels into thetreasure house of his god.   

{1:3} And the king spake unto Ashpenaz the master of his eunuchs,that he should bring [certain] of the children of Israel, and of theking's seed, and of the princes; 

{1:4} Children in whom [was] noblemish, but well favoured, and skilful in all wisdom, and cunning inknowledge, and understanding science, and such as [had] ability in themto stand in the king's palace, and whom they might teach the learningand the tongue of the Chaldeans. 

{1:5} And the king appointed them adaily provision of the king's meat, and of the wine which he drank: sonourishing them three years, that at the end thereof they might standbefore the king. 

{1:6} Now among these were of the children of Judah,Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah: 

{1:7} Unto whom the prince ofthe eunuchs gave names: for he gave unto Daniel [the name] ofBelteshazzar; and to Hananiah, of Shadrach; and to Mishael, of Meshach;and to Azariah, of Abed-nego.   

{1:8} But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defilehimself with the portion of the king's meat, nor with the wine which hedrank: therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that hemight not defile himself. 

{1:9} Now God had brought Daniel into favourand tender love with the prince of the eunuchs. 

{1:10} And the princeof the eunuchs said unto Daniel, I fear my lord the king, who hathappointed your meat and your drink: for why should he see your facesworse liking than the children which [are] of your sort? then shall yemake [me] endanger my head to the king. 

{1:11} Then said Daniel toMelzar, whom the prince of the eunuchs had set over Daniel, Hananiah,Mishael, and Azariah, 

{1:12} Prove thy servants, I beseech thee, tendays; and let them give us pulse to eat, and water to drink. 

{1:13}Then let our countenances be looked upon before thee, and thecountenance of the children that eat of the portion of the king's meat:and as thou seest, deal with thy servants. 

{1:14} So he consented tothem in this matter, and proved them ten days. 

{1:15} And at the end often days their countenances appeared fairer and fatter in flesh thanall the children which did eat the portion of the king's meat. 

{1:16}Thus Melzar took away the portion of their meat, and the wine that theyshould drink; and gave them pulse.   

{1:17} As for these four children, God gave them knowledge and skillin all learning and wisdom: and Daniel had understanding in all visionsand dreams. 

{1:18} Now at the end of the days that the king had said heshould bring them in, then the prince of the eunuchs brought them inbefore Nebuchadnezzar. 

{1:19} And the king communed with them; andamong them all was found none like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, andAzariah: therefore stood they before the king. 

{1:20} And in allmatters of wisdom [and] understanding, that the king enquired of them,he found them ten times better than all the magicians [and] astrologersthat [were] in all his realm. 

{1:21} And Daniel continued [even] untothe first year of king Cyrus.   

{2:1} And in the second year of the reign of NebuchadnezzarNebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams, wherewith his spirit was troubled, andhis sleep brake from him. 

{2:2} Then the king commanded to call themagicians, and the astrologers, and the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans,for to shew the king his dreams. So they came and stood before theking. 

{2:3} And the king said unto them, I have dreamed a dream, and myspirit was troubled to know the dream. 

{2:4} Then spake the Chaldeansto the king in Syriack, O king, live for ever: tell thy servants thedream, and we will shew the interpretation. 

{2:5} The king answered andsaid to the Chaldeans, The thing is gone from me: if ye will not makeknown unto me the dream, with the interpretation thereof, ye shall becut in pieces, and your houses shall be made a dunghill. 

{2:6} But ifye shew the dream, and the interpretation thereof, ye shall receive ofme gifts and rewards and great honour: therefore shew me the dream, andthe interpretation thereof. 

{2:7} They answered again and said, Let theking tell his servants the dream, and we will shew the interpretationof it. 

{2:8} The king answered and said, I know of certainty that yewould gain the time, because ye see the thing is gone from me. 

{2:9}But if ye will not make known unto me the dream, [there is but] onedecree for you: for ye have prepared lying and corrupt words to speakbefore me, till the time be changed: therefore tell me the dream, and Ishall know that ye can shew me the interpretation thereof.   

{2:10} The Chaldeans answered before the king, and said, There isnot a man upon the earth that can shew the king's matter: therefore[there is] no king, lord, nor ruler, [that] asked such things at anymagician, or astrologer, or Chaldean. 

{2:11} And [it is] a rare thingthat the king requireth, and there is none other that can shew itbefore the king, except the gods, whose dwelling is not with flesh.

{2:12} For this cause the king was angry and very furious, andcommanded to destroy all the wise [men] of Babylon. 

{2:13} And thedecree went forth that the wise [men] should be slain; and they soughtDaniel and his fellows to be slain.   

{2:14} Then Daniel answered with counsel and wisdom to Arioch thecaptain of the king's guard, which was gone forth to slay the wise[men] of Babylon: 

{2:15} He answered and said to Arioch the king'scaptain, Why [is] the decree [so] hasty from the king? Then Arioch madethe thing known to Daniel. 

{2:16} Then Daniel went in, and desired ofthe king that he would give him time, and that he would shew the kingthe interpretation. 

{2:17} Then Daniel went to his house, and made thething known to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions: 

{2:18}That they would desire mercies of the God of heaven concerning thissecret; that Daniel and his fellows should not perish with the rest ofthe wise [men] of Babylon.   

{2:19} Then was the secret revealed unto Daniel in a night vision.Then Daniel blessed the God of heaven. 

{2:20} Daniel answered and said,Blessed be the name of God for ever and ever: for wisdom and might arehis: 

{2:21} And he changeth the times and the seasons: he removethkings, and setteth up kings: he giveth wisdom unto the wise, andknowledge to them that know understanding: 

{2:22} He revealeth the deepand secret things: he knoweth what [is] in the darkness, and the lightdwelleth with him. 

{2:23} I thank thee, and praise thee, O thou God ofmy fathers, who hast given me wisdom and might, and hast made knownunto me now what we desired of thee: for thou hast [now] made knownunto us the king's matter.   

{2:24} Therefore Daniel went in unto Arioch, whom the king hadordained to destroy the wise [men] of Babylon: he went and said thusunto him; Destroy not the wise [men] of Babylon: bring me in before theking, and I will shew unto the king the interpretation. 

{2:25} ThenArioch brought in Daniel before the king in haste and said thus untohim, I have found a man of the captives of Judah, that will make knownunto the king the interpretation. 

{2:26} The king answered and said toDaniel, whose name [was] Belteshazzar, Art thou able to make known untome the dream which I have seen, and the interpretation thereof? 

{2:27}Daniel answered in the presence of the king, and said, The secret whichthe king hath demanded cannot the wise [men,] the astrologers, themagicians, the soothsayers, shew unto the king; 

{2:28} But there is aGod in heaven that revealeth secrets, and maketh known to the kingNebuchadnezzar what shall be in the latter days. Thy dream, and thevisions of thy head upon thy bed, are these; 

{2:29} As for thee, Oking, thy thoughts came [into thy mind] upon thy bed, what should cometo pass hereafter: and he that revealeth secrets maketh known to theewhat shall come to pass. 

{2:30} But as for me, this secret is notrevealed to me for [any] wisdom that I have more than any living, butfor [their] sakes that shall make known the interpretation to the king,and that thou mightest know the thoughts of thy heart.   

{2:31} Thou, O king, sawest, and behold a great image. This greatimage, whose brightness was excellent, stood before thee; and the formthereof [was] terrible. 

{2:32} This image's head [was] of fine gold,his breast and his arms of silver, his belly and his thighs of brass,

{2:33} His legs of iron, his feet part of iron and part of clay. 

{2:34}Thou sawest till that a stone was cut out without hands, which smotethe image upon his feet [that were] of iron and clay, and brake them topieces. 

{2:35} Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, andthe gold, broken to pieces together, and became like the chaff of thesummer threshingfloors; and the wind carried them away, that no placewas found for them: and the stone that smote the image became a greatmountain, and filled the whole earth.   

{2:36} This [is] the dream; and we will tell the interpretationthereof before the king. 

{2:37} Thou, O king, [art] a king of kings:for the God of heaven hath given thee a kingdom, power, and strength,and glory. 

{2:38} And wheresoever the children of men dwell, the beastsof the field and the fowls of the heaven hath he given into thine hand,and hath made thee ruler over them all. Thou [art] this head of gold.

{2:39} And after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee, andanother third kingdom of brass, which shall bear rule over all theearth. 

{2:40} And the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron: forasmuchas iron breaketh in pieces and subdueth all [things:] and as iron thatbreaketh all these, shall it break in pieces and bruise. 

{2:41} Andwhereas thou sawest the feet and toes, part of potters' clay, and partof iron, the kingdom shall be divided; but there shall be in it of thestrength of the iron, forasmuch as thou sawest the iron mixed with miryclay. 

{2:42} And [as] the toes of the feet [were] part of iron, andpart of clay, so the kingdom shall be partly strong, and partly broken.

{2:43} And whereas thou sawest iron mixed with miry clay, they shallmingle themselves with the seed of men: but they shall not cleave oneto another, even as iron is not mixed with clay. 

{2:44} And in the daysof these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom, which shallnever be destroyed: and the kingdom shall not be left to other people,[but] it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and itshall stand for ever. 

{2:45} Forasmuch as thou sawest that the stonewas cut out of the mountain without hands, and that it brake in piecesthe iron, the brass, the clay, the silver, and the gold; the great Godhath made known to the king what shall come to pass hereafter: and thedream is certain, and the interpretation thereof sure.   

{2:46} Then the king Nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face, andworshipped Daniel, and commanded that they should offer an oblation andsweet odours unto him. 

{2:47} The king answered unto Daniel, and said,Of a truth [it is,] that your God is a God of gods, and a Lord ofkings, and a revealer of secrets, seeing thou couldst reveal thissecret. 

{2:48} Then the king made Daniel a great man, and gave him manygreat gifts, and made him ruler over the whole province of Babylon, andchief of the governors over all the wise [men] of Babylon. 

{2:49} ThenDaniel requested of the king, and he set Shadrach, Meshach, andAbed-nego, over the affairs of the province of Babylon: but Daniel[sat] in the gate of the king.   

{3:1} Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold, whose height[was] threescore cubits, [and] the breadth thereof six cubits: he setit up in the plain of Dura, in the province of Babylon. 

{3:2} ThenNebuchadnezzar the king sent to gather together the princes, thegovernors, and the captains, the judges, the treasurers, thecounsellors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, to cometo the dedication of the image which Nebuchadnezzar the king had setup. 

{3:3} Then the princes, the governors, and captains, the judges,the treasurers, the counsellors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers ofthe provinces, were gathered together unto the dedication of the imagethat Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up; and they stood before theimage that Nebuchadnezzar had set up. 

{3:4} Then an herald cried aloud,To you it is commanded, O people, nations, and languages, 

{3:5} [That]at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut,psaltery, dulcimer, and all kinds of musick, ye fall down and worshipthe golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king hath set up: 

{3:6} Andwhoso falleth not down and worshippeth shall the same hour be cast intothe midst of a burning fiery furnace. 

{3:7} Therefore at that time,when all the people heard the sound of the cornet, flute, harp,sackbut, psaltery, and all kinds of musick, all the people, thenations, and the languages, fell down [and] worshipped the golden imagethat Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.   

{3:8} Wherefore at that time certain Chaldeans came near, andaccused the Jews. 

{3:9} They spake and said to the king Nebuchadnezzar,O king, live for ever. 

{3:10} Thou, O king, hast made a decree, thatevery man that shall hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp,sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer, and all kinds of musick, shall falldown and worship the golden image: 

{3:11} And whoso falleth not downand worshippeth, [that] he should be cast into the midst of a burningfiery furnace. 

{3:12} There are certain Jews whom thou hast set overthe affairs of the province of Babylon, Shadrach, Meshach, andAbed-nego; these men, O king, have not regarded thee: they serve notthy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up.   

{3:13} Then Nebuchadnezzar in [his] rage and fury commanded to bringShadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego. Then they brought these men beforethe king. 

{3:14} Nebuchadnezzar spake and said unto them, [Is it] true,O Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, do not ye serve my gods, norworship the golden image which I have set up? 

{3:15} Now if ye be readythat at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp,sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer, and all kinds of musick, ye fall downand worship the image which I have made; [well:] but if ye worship not,ye shall be cast the same hour into the midst of a burning fieryfurnace; and who [is] that God that shall deliver you out of my hands?

{3:16} Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, answered and said to the king,O Nebuchadnezzar, we [are] not careful to answer thee in this matter.

{3:17} If it be [so,] our God whom we serve is able to deliver us fromthe burning fiery furnace, and he will deliver [us] out of thine hand,O king. 

{3:18} But if not, be it known unto thee, O king, that we willnot serve thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up.   

{3:19} Then was Nebuchadnezzar full of fury, and the form of hisvisage was changed against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego:[therefore] he spake, and commanded that they should heat the furnaceone seven times more than it was wont to be heated. 

{3:20} And hecommanded the most mighty men that [were] in his army to bind Shadrach,Meshach, and Abed-nego, [and] to cast [them] into the burning fieryfurnace. 

{3:21} Then these men were bound in their coats, their hosen,and their hats, and their [other] garments, and were cast into themidst of the burning fiery furnace. 

{3:22} Therefore because the king'scommandment was urgent, and the furnace exceeding hot, the flame of thefire slew those men that took up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed- nego.

{3:23} And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, fell downbound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace. 

{3:24} ThenNebuchadnezzar the king was astonied, and rose up in haste, [and]spake, and said unto his counsellors, Did not we cast three men boundinto the midst of the fire? They answered and said unto the king, True,O king. 

{3:25} He answered and said, Lo, I see four men loose, walkingin the midst of the fire, and they have no hurt; and the form of thefourth is like the Son of God.   

{3:26} Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of the burningfiery furnace, [and] spake, and said, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego,ye servants of the most high God, come forth, and come [hither.] ThenShadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, came forth of the midst of the fire.

{3:27} And the princes, governors, and captains, and the king'scounsellors, being gathered together, saw these men, upon whose bodiesthe fire had no power, nor was an hair of their head singed, neitherwere their coats changed, nor the smell of fire had passed on them.

{3:28} [Then] Nebuchadnezzar spake, and said, Blessed [be] the God ofShadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, who hath sent his angel, anddelivered his servants that trusted in him, and have changed the king'sword, and yielded their bodies, that they might not serve nor worshipany god, except their own God. 

{3:29} Therefore I make a decree, Thatevery people, nation, and language, which speak any thing amiss againstthe God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, shall be cut in pieces,and their houses shall be made a dunghill: because there is no otherGod that can deliver after this sort. 

{3:30} Then the king promotedShadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, in the province of Babylon.   

{4:1} Nebuchadnezzar the king, unto all people, nations, andlanguages, that dwell in all the earth; Peace be multiplied unto you.

{4:2} I thought it good to shew the signs and wonders that the high Godhath wrought toward me. 

{4:3} How great [are] his signs! and how mighty[are] his wonders! his kingdom [is] an everlasting kingdom, and hisdominion [is] from generation to generation.   

{4:4} I Nebuchadnezzar was at rest in mine house, and flourishing inmy palace: 

{4:5} I saw a dream which made me afraid, and the thoughtsupon my bed and the visions of my head troubled me. 

{4:6} Thereforemade I a decree to bring in all the wise [men] of Babylon before me,that they might make known unto me the interpretation of the dream.

{4:7} Then came in the magicians, the astrologers, the Chaldeans, andthe soothsayers: and I told the dream before them; but they did notmake known unto me the interpretation thereof.   

{4:8} But at the last Daniel came in before me, whose name [was]Belteshazzar, according to the name of my god, and in whom is thespirit of the holy gods: and before him I told the dream, [saying,]

{4:9} O Belteshazzar, master of the magicians, because I know that thespirit of the holy gods [is] in thee, and no secret troubleth thee,tell me the visions of my dream that I have seen, and theinterpretation thereof. 

{4:10} Thus [were] the visions of mine head inmy bed; I saw, and behold a tree in the midst of the earth, and theheight thereof [was] great. 

{4:11} The tree grew, and was strong, andthe height thereof reached unto heaven, and the sight thereof to theend of all the earth: 

{4:12} The leaves thereof [were] fair, and thefruit thereof much, and in it [was] meat for all: the beasts of thefield had shadow under it, and the fowls of the heaven dwelt in theboughs thereof, and all flesh was fed of it. 

{4:13} I saw in thevisions of my head upon my bed, and, behold, a watcher and an holy onecame down from heaven; 

{4:14} He cried aloud, and said thus, Hew downthe tree, and cut off his branches, shake off his leaves, and scatterhis fruit: let the beasts get away from under it, and the fowls fromhis branches: 

{4:15} Nevertheless leave the stump of his roots in theearth, even with a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of thefield; and let it be wet with the dew of heaven, and [let] his portion[be] with the beasts in the grass of the earth: 

{4:16} Let his heart bechanged from man's, and let a beast's heart be given unto him; and letseven times pass over him. 

{4:17} This matter [is] by the decree of thewatchers, and the demand by the word of the holy ones: to the intentthat the living may know that the most High ruleth in the kingdom ofmen, and giveth it to whomsoever he will, and setteth up over it thebasest of men. 

{4:18} This dream I king Nebuchadnezzar have seen. Nowthou, O Belteshazzar, declare the interpretation thereof, forasmuch asall the wise [men] of my kingdom are not able to make known unto me theinterpretation: but thou [art] able; for the spirit of the holy gods[is] in thee.   

{4:19} Then Daniel, whose name [was] Belteshazzar, was astonied forone hour, and his thoughts troubled him. The king spake, and said,Belteshazzar, let not the dream, or the interpretation thereof, troublethee. Belteshazzar answered and said, My lord, the dream [be] to themthat hate thee, and the interpretation thereof to thine enemies. 

{4:20}The tree that thou sawest, which grew, and was strong, whose heightreached unto the heaven, and the sight thereof to all the earth; 

{4:21}Whose leaves [were] fair, and the fruit thereof much, and in it [was]meat for all; under which the beasts of the field dwelt, and upon whosebranches the fowls of the heaven had their habitation: 

{4:22} It [is]thou, O king, that art grown and become strong: for thy greatness isgrown, and reacheth unto heaven, and thy dominion to the end of theearth. 

{4:23} And whereas the king saw a watcher and an holy one comingdown from heaven, and saying, Hew the tree down, and destroy it; yetleave the stump of the roots thereof in the earth, even with a band ofiron and brass, in the tender grass of the field; and let it be wetwith the dew of heaven, and [let] his portion [be] with the beasts ofthe field, till seven times pass over him; 

{4:24} This [is] theinterpretation, O king, and this [is] the decree of the most High,which is come upon my lord the king: 

{4:25} That they shall drive theefrom men, and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field, andthey shall make thee to eat grass as oxen, and they shall wet thee withthe dew of heaven, and seven times shall pass over thee, till thou knowthat the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it towhomsoever he will. 

{4:26} And whereas they commanded to leave thestump of the tree roots; thy kingdom shall be sure unto thee, afterthat thou shalt have known that the heavens do rule. 

{4:27} Wherefore,O king, let my counsel be acceptable unto thee, and break off thy sinsby righteousness, and thine iniquities by shewing mercy to the poor; ifit may be a lengthening of thy tranquility.   

{4:28} All this came upon the king Nebuchadnezzar. 

{4:29} At the endof twelve months he walked in the palace of the kingdom of Babylon.

{4:30} The king spake, and said, Is not this great Babylon, that I havebuilt for the house of the kingdom by the might of my power, and forthe honour of my majesty? 

{4:31} While the word [was] in the king'smouth, there fell a voice from heaven, [saying,] O king Nebuchadnezzar,to thee it is spoken; The kingdom is departed from thee. 

{4:32} Andthey shall drive thee from men, and thy dwelling [shall be] with thebeasts of the field: they shall make thee to eat grass as oxen, andseven times shall pass over thee, until thou know that the most Highruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will.

{4:33} The same hour was the thing fulfilled upon Nebuchadnezzar: andhe was driven from men, and did eat grass as oxen, and his body was wetwith the dew of heaven, till his hairs were grown like eagles[feathers,] and his nails like birds' [claws. ]

{4:34} And at the end ofthe days I Nebuchadnezzar lifted up mine eyes unto heaven, and mineunderstanding returned unto me, and I blessed the most High, and Ipraised and honoured him that liveth for ever, whose dominion [is] aneverlasting dominion, and his kingdom [is] from generation togeneration: 

{4:35} And all the inhabitants of the earth [are] reputedas nothing: and he doeth according to his will in the army of heaven,and [among] the inhabitants of the earth: and none can stay his hand,or say unto him, What doest thou? 

{4:36} At the same time my reasonreturned unto me; and for the glory of my kingdom, mine honour andbrightness returned unto me; and my counsellors and my lords soughtunto me; and I was established in my kingdom, and excellent majesty wasadded unto me. 

{4:37} Now I Nebuchadnezzar praise and extol and honourthe King of heaven, all whose works [are] truth, and his ways judgment:and those that walk in pride he is able to abase.   

{5:1} Belshazzar the king made a great feast to a thousand of hislords, and drank wine before the thousand. 

{5:2} Belshazzar, whiles hetasted the wine, commanded to bring the golden and silver vessels whichhis father Nebuchadnezzar had taken out of the temple which [was] inJerusalem; that the king, and his princes, his wives, and hisconcubines, might drink therein. 

{5:3} Then they brought the goldenvessels that were taken out of the temple of the house of God which[was] at Jerusalem; and the king, and his princes, his wives, and hisconcubines, drank in them. 

{5:4} They drank wine, and praised the godsof gold, and of silver, of brass, of iron, of wood, and of stone.   

{5:5} In the same hour came forth fingers of a man's hand, and wroteover against the candlestick upon the plaister of the wall of theking's palace: and the king saw the part of the hand that wrote. 

{5:6}Then the king's countenance was changed, and his thoughts troubled him,so that the joints of his loins were loosed, and his knees smote oneagainst another. 

{5:7} The king cried aloud to bring in theastrologers, the Chaldeans, and the soothsayers. [And] the king spake,and said to the wise [men] of Babylon, Whosoever shall read thiswriting, and shew me the interpretation thereof, shall be clothed withscarlet, and [have] a chain of gold about his neck, and shall be thethird ruler in the kingdom. 

{5:8} Then came in all the king's wise[men:] but they could not read the writing, nor make known to the kingthe interpretation thereof. 

{5:9} Then was king Belshazzar greatlytroubled, and his countenance was changed in him, and his lords wereastonied.   

{5:10} [Now] the queen, by reason of the words of the king and hislords, came into the banquet house: [and] the queen spake and said, Oking, live for ever: let not thy thoughts trouble thee, nor let thycountenance be changed: 

{5:11} There is a man in thy kingdom, in whom[is] the spirit of the holy gods; and in the days of thy father lightand understanding and wisdom, like the wisdom of the gods, was found inhim; whom the king Nebuchadnezzar thy father, the king, [I say,] thyfather, made master of the magicians, astrologers, Chaldeans, [and]soothsayers; 

{5:12} Forasmuch as an excellent spirit, and knowledge,and understanding, interpreting of dreams, and shewing of hardsentences, and dissolving of doubts, were found in the same Daniel,whom the king named Belteshazzar: now let Daniel be called, and he willshew the interpretation. 

{5:13} Then was Daniel brought in before theking. [And] the king spake and said unto Daniel, [Art] thou thatDaniel, which [art] of the children of the captivity of Judah, whom theking my father brought out of Jewry? 

{5:14} I have even heard of thee,that the spirit of the gods [is] in thee, and [that] light andunderstanding and excellent wisdom is found in thee. 

{5:15} And now thewise [men,] the astrologers, have been brought in before me, that theyshould read this writing, and make known unto me the interpretationthereof: but they could not shew the interpretation of the thing:

{5:16} And I have heard of thee, that thou canst make interpretations,and dissolve doubts: now if thou canst read the writing, and make knownto me the interpretation thereof, thou shalt be clothed with scarlet,and [have] a chain of gold about thy neck, and shalt be the third rulerin the kingdom.   

{5:17} Then Daniel answered and said before the king, Let thy giftsbe to thyself, and give thy rewards to another; yet I will read thewriting unto the king, and make known to him the interpretation. 

{5:18}O thou king, the most high God gave Nebuchadnezzar thy father akingdom, and majesty, and glory, and honour: 

{5:19} And for the majestythat he gave him, all people, nations, and languages, trembled andfeared before him: whom he would he slew; and whom he would he keptalive; and whom he would he set up; and whom he would he put down.

{5:20} But when his heart was lifted up, and his mind hardened inpride, he was deposed from his kingly throne, and they took his gloryfrom him: 

{5:21} And he was driven from the sons of men; and his heartwas made like the beasts, and his dwelling [was] with the wild asses:they fed him with grass like oxen, and his body was wet with the dew ofheaven; till he knew that the most high God ruled in the kingdom ofmen, and [that] he appointeth over it whomsoever he will. 

{5:22} Andthou his son, O Belshazzar, hast not humbled thine heart, though thouknewest all this; 

{5:23} But hast lifted up thyself against the Lord ofheaven; and they have brought the vessels of his house before thee, andthou, and thy lords, thy wives, and thy concubines, have drunk wine inthem; and thou hast praised the gods of silver, and gold, of brass,iron, wood, and stone, which see not, nor hear, nor know: and the Godin whose hand thy breath [is,] and whose [are] all thy ways, hast thounot glorified: 

{5:24} Then was the part of the hand sent from him; andthis writing was written.   

{5:25} And this [is] the writing that was written, MENE, MENE,TEKEL, UPHARSIN. 

{5:26} This [is] the interpretation of the thing:MENE; God hath numbered thy kingdom, and finished it. 

{5:27} TEKEL;Thou art weighed in the balances, and art found wanting. 

{5:28} PERES;Thy kingdom is divided, and given to the Medes and Persians. 

{5:29}Then commanded Belshazzar, and they clothed Daniel with scarlet, and[put] a chain of gold about his neck, and made a proclamationconcerning him, that he should be the third ruler in the kingdom.   

{5:30} In that night was Belshazzar the king of the Chaldeans slain.

{5:31} And Darius the Median took the kingdom, [being] about threescoreand two years old.   

{6:1} It pleased Darius to set over the kingdom an hundred andtwenty princes, which should be over the whole kingdom; 

{6:2} And overthese three presidents; of whom Daniel [was] first: that the princesmight give accounts unto them, and the king should have no damage.

{6:3} Then this Daniel was preferred above the presidents and princes,because an excellent spirit [was] in him; and the king thought to sethim over the whole realm.   

{6:4} Then the presidents and princes sought to find occasionagainst Daniel concerning the kingdom; but they could find noneoccasion nor fault; forasmuch as he [was] faithful, neither was thereany error or fault found in him. 

{6:5} Then said these men, We shallnot find any occasion against this Daniel, except we find [it] againsthim concerning the law of his God. 

{6:6} Then these presidents andprinces assembled together to the king, and said thus unto him, KingDarius, live for ever. 

{6:7} All the presidents of the kingdom, thegovernors, and the princes, the counsellors, and the captains, haveconsulted together to establish a royal statute, and to make a firmdecree, that whosoever shall ask a petition of any God or man forthirty days, save of thee, O king, he shall be cast into the den oflions. 

{6:8} Now, O king, establish the decree, and sign the writing,that it be not changed, according to the law of the Medes and Persians,which altereth not. 

{6:9} Wherefore king Darius signed the writing andthe decree.   

{6:10} Now when Daniel knew that the writing was signed, he wentinto his house; and his windows being open in his chamber towardJerusalem, he kneeled upon his knees three times a day, and prayed, andgave thanks before his God, as he did aforetime. 

{6:11} Then these menassembled, and found Daniel praying and making supplication before hisGod. 

{6:12} Then they came near, and spake before the king concerningthe king's decree; Hast thou not signed a decree, that every man thatshall ask [a petition] of any God or man within thirty days, save ofthee, O king, shall be cast into the den of lions? The king answeredand said, The thing is true, according to the law of the Medes andPersians, which altereth not. 

{6:13} Then answered they and said beforethe king, That Daniel, which [is] of the children of the captivity ofJudah, regardeth not thee, O king, nor the decree that thou hastsigned, but maketh his petition three times a day. 

{6:14} Then theking, when he heard [these] words, was sore displeased with himself,and set [his] heart on Daniel to deliver him: and he laboured till thegoing down of the sun to deliver him. 

{6:15} Then these men assembledunto the king, and said unto the king, Know, O king, that the law ofthe Medes and Persians [is,] That no decree nor statute which the kingestablisheth may be changed. 

{6:16} Then the king commanded, and theybrought Daniel, and cast [him] into the den of lions. [Now] the kingspake and said unto Daniel, Thy God whom thou servest continually, hewill deliver thee. 

{6:17} And a stone was brought and laid upon themouth of the den; and the king sealed it with his own signet, and withthe signet of his lords; that the purpose might not be changedconcerning Daniel.   

{6:18} Then the king went to his palace, and passed the nightfasting: neither were instruments of musick brought before him: and hissleep went from him. 

{6:19} Then the king arose very early in themorning, and went in haste unto the den of lions. 

{6:20} And when hecame to the den, he cried with a lamentable voice unto Daniel: [and]the king spake and said to Daniel, O Daniel, servant of the living God,is thy God, whom thou servest continually, able to deliver thee fromthe lions? 

{6:21} Then said Daniel unto the king, O king, live forever. 

{6:22} My God hath sent his angel, and hath shut the lionsmouths, that they have not hurt me: forasmuch as before him innocencywas found in me; and also before thee, O king, have I done no hurt.

{6:23} Then was the king exceeding glad for him, and commanded thatthey should take Daniel up out of the den. So Daniel was taken up outof the den, and no manner of hurt was found upon him, because hebelieved in his God.   

{6:24} And the king commanded, and they brought those men which hadaccused Daniel, and they cast [them] into the den of lions, them, theirchildren, and their wives; and the lions had the mastery of them, andbrake all their bones in pieces or ever they came at the bottom of theden.   

{6:25} Then king Darius wrote unto all people, nations, andlanguages, that dwell in all the earth; Peace be multiplied unto you.

{6:26} I make a decree, That in every dominion of my kingdom mentremble and fear before the God of Daniel: for he is the living God,and stedfast for ever, and his kingdom [that] which shall not bedestroyed, and his dominion [shall be even] unto the end. 

{6:27} Hedelivereth and rescueth, and he worketh signs and wonders in heaven andin earth, who hath delivered Daniel from the power of the lions. 

{6:28}So this Daniel prospered in the reign of Darius, and in the reign ofCyrus the Persian.   

{7:1} In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon Daniel had adream and visions of his head upon his bed: then he wrote the dream,[and] told the sum of the matters. 

{7:2} Daniel spake and said, I sawin my vision by night, and, behold, the four winds of the heaven stroveupon the great sea. 

{7:3} And four great beasts came up from the sea,diverse one from another. 

{7:4} The first [was] like a lion, and hadeagle's wings: I beheld till the wings thereof were plucked, and it waslifted up from the earth, and made stand upon the feet as a man, and aman's heart was given to it. 

{7:5} And behold another beast, a second,like to a bear, and it raised up itself on one side, and [it had] threeribs in the mouth of it between the teeth of it: and they said thusunto it, Arise, devour much flesh. 

{7:6} After this I beheld, and loanother, like a leopard, which had upon the back of it four wings of afowl; the beast had also four heads; and dominion was given to it.

{7:7} After this I saw in the night visions, and behold a fourth beast,dreadful and terrible, and strong exceedingly; and it had great ironteeth: it devoured and brake in pieces, and stamped the residue withthe feet of it: and it [was] diverse from all the beasts that [were]before it; and it had ten horns. 

{7:8} I considered the horns, and,behold, there came up among them another little horn, before whom therewere three of the first horns plucked up by the roots: and, behold, inthis horn [were] eyes like the eyes of man, and a mouth speaking greatthings.   

{7:9} I beheld till the thrones were cast down, and the Ancient ofdays did sit, whose garment [was] white as snow, and the hair of hishead like the pure wool: his throne [was like] the fiery flame, [and]his wheels [as] burning fire. 

{7:10} A fiery stream issued and cameforth from before him: thousand thousands ministered unto him, and tenthousand times ten thousand stood before him: the judgment was set, andthe books were opened. 

{7:11} I beheld then because of the voice of thegreat words which the horn spake: I beheld [even] till the beast wasslain, and his body destroyed, and given to the burning flame. 

{7:12}As concerning the rest of the beasts, they had their dominion takenaway: yet their lives were prolonged for a season and time. 

{7:13} Isaw in the night visions, and, behold, [one] like the Son of man camewith the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of days, and theybrought him near before him. 

{7:14} And there was given him dominion,and glory, and a kingdom, that all people, nations, and languages,should serve him: his dominion [is] an everlasting dominion, whichshall not pass away, and his kingdom [that] which shall not bedestroyed.   

{7:15} I Daniel was grieved in my spirit in the midst of [my] body,and the visions of my head troubled me. 

{7:16} I came near unto one ofthem that stood by, and asked him the truth of all this. So he told me,and made me know the interpretation of the things. 

{7:17} These greatbeasts, which are four, [are] four kings, [which] shall arise out ofthe earth. 

{7:18} But the saints of the most High shall take thekingdom, and possess the kingdom for ever, even for ever and ever.

{7:19} Then I would know the truth of the fourth beast, which wasdiverse from all the others, exceeding dreadful, whose teeth [were of]iron, and his nails [of] brass; [which] devoured, brake in pieces, andstamped the residue with his feet; 

{7:20} And of the ten horns that[were] in his head, and [of] the other which came up, and before whomthree fell; even [of] that horn that had eyes, and a mouth that spakevery great things, whose look [was] more stout than his fellows. 

{7:21}I beheld, and the same horn made war with the saints, and prevailedagainst them; 

{7:22} Until the Ancient of days came, and judgment wasgiven to the saints of the most High; and the time came that the saintspossessed the kingdom. 

{7:23} Thus he said, The fourth beast shall bethe fourth kingdom upon earth, which shall be diverse from allkingdoms, and shall devour the whole earth, and shall tread it down,and break it in pieces. 

{7:24} And the ten horns out of this kingdom[are] ten kings [that] shall arise: and another shall rise after them;and he shall be diverse from the first, and he shall subdue threekings. 

{7:25} And he shall speak [great] words against the most High,and shall wear out the saints of the most High, and think to changetimes and laws: and they shall be given into his hand until a time andtimes and the dividing of time. 

{7:26} But the judgment shall sit, andthey shall take away his dominion, to consume and to destroy [it] untothe end. 

{7:27} And the kingdom and dominion, and the greatness of thekingdom under the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of thesaints of the most High, whose kingdom [is] an everlasting kingdom, andall dominions shall serve and obey him. 

{7:28} Hitherto [is] the end ofthe matter. As for me Daniel, my cogitations much troubled me, and mycountenance changed in me: but I kept the matter in my heart.   

{8:1} In the third year of the reign of king Belshazzar a visionappeared unto me, [even unto] me Daniel, after that which appeared untome at the first. 

{8:2} And I saw in a vision; and it came to pass, whenI saw, that I [was] at Shushan [in] the palace, which [is] in theprovince of Elam; and I saw in a vision, and I was by the river ofUlai. 

{8:3} Then I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, therestood before the river a ram which had [two] horns: and the [two] horns[were] high; but one [was] higher than the other, and the higher cameup last. 

{8:4} I saw the ram pushing westward, and northward, andsouthward; so that no beasts might stand before him, neither [was thereany] that could deliver out of his hand; but he did according to hiswill, and became great. 

{8:5} And as I was considering, behold, an hegoat came from the west on the face of the whole earth, and touched notthe ground: and the goat [had] a notable horn between his eyes. 

{8:6}And he came to the ram that had [two] horns, which I had seen standingbefore the river, and ran unto him in the fury of his power. 

{8:7} AndI saw him come close unto the ram, and he was moved with choler againsthim, and smote the ram, and brake his two horns: and there was no powerin the ram to stand before him, but he cast him down to the ground, andstamped upon him: and there was none that could deliver the ram out ofhis hand. 

{8:8} Therefore the he goat waxed very great: and when he wasstrong, the great horn was broken; and for it came up four notable onestoward the four winds of heaven. 

{8:9} And out of one of them cameforth a little horn, which waxed exceeding great, toward the south, andtoward the east, and toward the pleasant [land. ]

{8:10} And it waxedgreat, [even] to the host of heaven; and it cast down [some] of thehost and of the stars to the ground, and stamped upon them. 

{8:11} Yea,he magnified [himself] even to the prince of the host, and by him thedaily [sacrifice] was taken away, and the place of his sanctuary wascast down. 

{8:12} And an host was given [him] against the daily[sacrifice] by reason of transgression, and it cast down the truth tothe ground; and it practised, and prospered.   

{8:13} Then I heard one saint speaking, and another saint said untothat certain [saint] which spake, How long [shall be] the vision[concerning] the daily [sacrifice,] and the transgression ofdesolation, to give both the sanctuary and the host to be trodden underfoot? 

{8:14} And he said unto me, Unto two thousand and three hundreddays; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed.   

{8:15} And it came to pass, when I, [even] I Daniel, had seen thevision, and sought for the meaning, then, behold, there stood before meas the appearance of a man. 

{8:16} And I heard a man's voice between[the banks of] Ulai, which called, and said, Gabriel, make this [man]to understand the vision. 

{8:17} So he came near where I stood: andwhen he came, I was afraid, and fell upon my face: but he said unto me,Understand, O son of man: for at the time of the end [shall be] thevision. 

{8:18} Now as he was speaking with me, I was in a deep sleep onmy face toward the ground: but he touched me, and set me upright.

{8:19} And he said, Behold, I will make thee know what shall be in thelast end of the indignation: for at the time appointed the end [shallbe. ]

{8:20} The ram which thou sawest having [two] horns [are] thekings of Media and Persia. 

{8:21} And the rough goat [is] the king ofGrecia: and the great horn that [is] between his eyes [is] the firstking. 

{8:22} Now that being broken, whereas four stood up for it, fourkingdoms shall stand up out of the nation, but not in his power. 

{8:23}And in the latter time of their kingdom, when the transgressors arecome to the full, a king of fierce countenance, and understanding darksentences, shall stand up. 

{8:24} And his power shall be mighty, butnot by his own power: and he shall destroy wonderfully, and shallprosper, and practise, and shall destroy the mighty and the holypeople. 

{8:25} And through his policy also he shall cause craft toprosper in his hand; and he shall magnify [himself] in his heart, andby peace shall destroy many: he shall also stand up against the Princeof princes; but he shall be broken without hand. 

{8:26} And the visionof the evening and the morning which was told [is] true: wherefore shutthou up the vision; for it [shall be] for many days. 

{8:27} And IDaniel fainted, and was sick [certain] days; afterward I rose up, anddid the king's business; and I was astonished at the vision, but noneunderstood [it.]   

{9:1} In the first year of Darius the son of Ahasuerus, of the seedof the Medes, which was made king over the realm of the Chaldeans;

{9:2} In the first year of his reign I Daniel understood by books thenumber of the years, whereof the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah theprophet, that he would accomplish seventy years in the desolations ofJerusalem.   

{9:3} And I set my face unto the Lord God, to seek by prayer andsupplications, with fasting, and sackcloth, and ashes: 

{9:4} And Iprayed unto the LORD my God, and made my confession, and said, O Lord,the great and dreadful God, keeping the covenant and mercy to them thatlove him, and to them that keep his commandments; 

{9:5} We have sinned,and have committed iniquity, and have done wickedly, and have rebelled,even by departing from thy precepts and from thy judgments: 

{9:6}Neither have we hearkened unto thy servants the prophets, which spakein thy name to our kings, our princes, and our fathers, and to all thepeople of the land. 

{9:7} O Lord, righteousness [belongeth] unto thee,but unto us confusion of faces, as at this day; to the men of Judah,and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and unto all Israel, [that are]near, and [that are] far off, through all the countries whither thouhast driven them, because of their trespass that they have trespassedagainst thee. 

{9:8} O Lord, to us [belongeth] confusion of face, to ourkings, to our princes, and to our fathers, because we have sinnedagainst thee. 

{9:9} To the Lord our God [belong] mercies andforgivenesses, though we have rebelled against him; 

{9:10} Neither havewe obeyed the voice of the LORD our God, to walk in his laws, which heset before us by his servants the prophets. 

{9:11} Yea, all Israel havetransgressed thy law, even by departing, that they might not obey thyvoice; therefore the curse is poured upon us, and the oath that [is]written in the law of Moses the servant of God, because we have sinnedagainst him. 

{9:12} And he hath confirmed his words, which he spakeagainst us, and against our judges that judged us, by bringing upon usa great evil: for under the whole heaven hath not been done as hathbeen done upon Jerusalem. 

{9:13} As [it is] written in the law ofMoses, all this evil is come upon us: yet made we not our prayer beforethe LORD our God, that we might turn from our iniquities, andunderstand thy truth. 

{9:14} Therefore hath the LORD watched upon theevil, and brought it upon us: for the LORD our God [is] righteous inall his works which he doeth: for we obeyed not his voice. 

{9:15} Andnow, O Lord our God, that hast brought thy people forth out of the landof Egypt with a mighty hand, and hast gotten thee renown, as at thisday; we have sinned, we have done wickedly.   

{9:16} O Lord, according to all thy righteousness, I beseech thee,let thine anger and thy fury be turned away from thy city Jerusalem,thy holy mountain: because for our sins, and for the iniquities of ourfathers, Jerusalem and thy people [are become] a reproach to all [thatare] about us. 

{9:17} Now therefore, O our God, hear the prayer of thyservant, and his supplications, and cause thy face to shine upon thysanctuary that is desolate, for the Lord's sake. 

{9:18} O my God,incline thine ear, and hear; open thine eyes, and behold ourdesolations, and the city which is called by thy name: for we do notpresent our supplications before thee for our righteousnesses, but forthy great mercies. 

{9:19} O Lord, hear; O Lord, forgive; O Lord,hearken and do; defer not, for thine own sake, O my God: for thy cityand thy people are called by thy name.   

{9:20} And whiles I [was] speaking, and praying, and confessing mysin and the sin of my people Israel, and presenting my supplicationbefore the LORD my God for the holy mountain of my God; 

{9:21} Yea,whiles I [was] speaking in prayer, even the man Gabriel, whom I hadseen in the vision at the beginning, being caused to fly swiftly,touched me about the time of the evening oblation. 

{9:22} And heinformed [me,] and talked with me, and said, O Daniel, I am now comeforth to give thee skill and understanding. 

{9:23} At the beginning ofthy supplications the commandment came forth, and I am come to shew[thee;] for thou [art] greatly beloved: therefore understand thematter, and consider the vision. 

{9:24} Seventy weeks are determinedupon thy people and upon thy holy city, to finish the transgression,and to make an end of sins, and to make reconciliation for iniquity,and to bring in everlasting righteousness, and to seal up the visionand prophecy, and to anoint the most Holy. 

{9:25} Know therefore andunderstand, [that] from the going forth of the commandment to restoreand to build Jerusalem unto the Messiah the Prince [shall be] sevenweeks, and threescore and two weeks: the street shall be built again,and the wall, even in troublous times. 

{9:26} And after threescore andtwo weeks shall Messiah be cut off, but not for himself: and the peopleof the prince that shall come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary;and the end thereof [shall be] with a flood, and unto the end of thewar desolations are determined. 

{9:27} And he shall confirm thecovenant with many for one week: and in the midst of the week he shallcause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease, and for theoverspreading of abominations he shall make [it] desolate, even untilthe consummation, and that determined shall be poured upon the desolate.   

{10:1} In the third year of Cyrus king of Persia a thing wasrevealed unto Daniel, whose name was called Belteshazzar; and the thing[was] true, but the time appointed [was] long: and he understood thething, and had understanding of the vision. 

{10:2} In those days IDaniel was mourning three full weeks. 

{10:3} I ate no pleasant bread,neither came flesh nor wine in my mouth, neither did I anoint myself atall, till three whole weeks were fulfilled. 

{10:4} And in the four andtwentieth day of the first month, as I was by the side of the greatriver, which [is] Hiddekel; 

{10:5} Then I lifted up mine eyes, andlooked, and behold a certain man clothed in linen, whose loins [were]girded with fine gold of Uphaz: 

{10:6} His body also [was] like theberyl, and his face as the appearance of lightning, and his eyes aslamps of fire, and his arms and his feet like in colour to polishedbrass, and the voice of his words like the voice of a multitude. 

{10:7}And I Daniel alone saw the vision: for the men that were with me sawnot the vision; but a great quaking fell upon them, so that they fledto hide themselves. 

{10:8} Therefore I was left alone, and saw thisgreat vision, and there remained no strength in me: for my comelinesswas turned in me into corruption, and I retained no strength. 

{10:9}Yet heard I the voice of his words: and when I heard the voice of hiswords, then was I in a deep sleep on my face, and my face toward theground.   

{10:10} And, behold, an hand touched me, which set me upon my kneesand [upon] the palms of my hands. 

{10:11} And he said unto me, ODaniel, a man greatly beloved, understand the words that I speak untothee, and stand upright: for unto thee am I now sent. And when he hadspoken this word unto me, I stood trembling. 

{10:12} Then said he untome, Fear not, Daniel: for from the first day that thou didst set thineheart to understand, and to chasten thyself before thy God, thy wordswere heard, and I am come for thy words. 

{10:13} But the prince of thekingdom of Persia withstood me one and twenty days: but, lo, Michael,one of the chief princes, came to help me; and I remained there withthe kings of Persia. 

{10:14} Now I am come to make thee understand whatshall befall thy people in the latter days: for yet the vision [is] for[many] days. 

{10:15} And when he had spoken such words unto me, I setmy face toward the ground, and I became dumb. 

{10:16} And, behold,[one] like the similitude of the sons of men touched my lips: then Iopened my mouth, and spake, and said unto him that stood before me, Omy lord, by the vision my sorrows are turned upon me, and I haveretained no strength. 

{10:17} For how can the servant of this my lordtalk with this my lord? for as for me, straightway there remained nostrength in me, neither is there breath left in me. 

{10:18} Then therecame again and touched me [one] like the appearance of a man, and hestrengthened me, 

{10:19} And said, O man greatly beloved, fear not:peace [be] unto thee, be strong, yea, be strong. And when he had spokenunto me, I was strengthened, and said, Let my lord speak; for thou haststrengthened me. 

{10:20} Then said he, Knowest thou wherefore I comeunto thee? and now will I return to fight with the prince of Persia:and when I am gone forth, lo, the prince of Grecia shall come. 

{10:21}But I will shew thee that which is noted in the scripture of truth: and[there is] none that holdeth with me in these things, but Michael yourprince.   

{11:1} Also I in the first year of Darius the Mede, [even] I, stoodto confirm and to strengthen him. 

{11:2} And now will I shew thee thetruth. Behold, there shall stand up yet three kings in Persia; and thefourth shall be far richer than [they] all: and by his strength throughhis riches he shall stir up all against the realm of Grecia. 

{11:3} Anda mighty king shall stand up, that shall rule with great dominion, anddo according to his will. 

{11:4} And when he shall stand up, hiskingdom shall be broken, and shall be divided toward the four winds ofheaven; and not to his posterity, nor according to his dominion whichhe ruled: for his kingdom shall be plucked up, even for others besidethose.   

{11:5} And the king of the south shall be strong, and [one] of hisprinces; and he shall be strong above him, and have dominion; hisdominion [shall be] a great dominion. 

{11:6} And in the end of yearsthey shall join themselves together; for the king's daughter of thesouth shall come to the king of the north to make an agreement: but sheshall not retain the power of the arm; neither shall he stand, nor hisarm: but she shall be given up, and they that brought her, and he thatbegat her, and he that strengthened her in [these] times. 

{11:7} Butout of a branch of her roots shall [one] stand up in his estate, whichshall come with an army, and shall enter into the fortress of the kingof the north, and shall deal against them, and shall prevail: 

{11:8}And shall also carry captives into Egypt their gods, with theirprinces, [and] with their precious vessels of silver and of gold; andhe shall continue [more] years than the king of the north. 

{11:9} Sothe king of the south shall come into [his] kingdom, and shall returninto his own land. 

{11:10} But his sons shall be stirred up, and shallassemble a multitude of great forces: and [one] shall certainly come,and overflow, and pass through: then shall he return, and be stirredup, [even] to his fortress. 

{11:11} And the king of the south shall bemoved with choler, and shall come forth and fight with him, [even] withthe king of the north: and he shall set forth a great multitude; butthe multitude shall be given into his hand. 

{11:12} [And] when he hathtaken away the multitude, his heart shall be lifted up; and he shallcast down [many] ten thousands: but he shall not be strengthened [byit. ]

{11:13} For the king of the north shall return, and shall setforth a multitude greater than the former, and shall certainly comeafter certain years with a great army and with much riches. 

{11:14} Andin those times there shall many stand up against the king of the south:also the robbers of thy people shall exalt themselves to establish thevision; but they shall fall. 

{11:15} So the king of the north shallcome, and cast up a mount, and take the most fenced cities: and thearms of the south shall not withstand, neither his chosen people,neither [shall there be any] strength to withstand. 

{11:16} But he thatcometh against him shall do according to his own will, and none shallstand before him: and he shall stand in the glorious land, which by hishand shall be consumed. 

{11:17} He shall also set his face to enterwith the strength of his whole kingdom, and upright ones with him; thusshall he do: and he shall give him the daughter of women, corruptingher: but she shall not stand [on his side,] neither be for him. 

{11:18}After this shall he turn his face unto the isles, and shall take many:but a prince for his own behalf shall cause the reproach offered by himto cease; without his own reproach he shall cause [it] to turn uponhim. 

{11:19} Then he shall turn his face toward the fort of his ownland: but he shall stumble and fall, and not be found. 

{11:20} Thenshall stand up in his estate a raiser of taxes [in] the glory of thekingdom: but within few days he shall be destroyed, neither in anger,nor in battle. 

{11:21} And in his estate shall stand up a vile person,to whom they shall not give the honour of the kingdom: but he shallcome in peaceably, and obtain the kingdom by flatteries. 

{11:22} Andwith the arms of a flood shall they be overflown from before him, andshall be broken; yea, also the prince of the covenant. 

{11:23} Andafter the league [made] with him he shall work deceitfully: for heshall come up, and shall become strong with a small people. 

{11:24} Heshall enter peaceably even upon the fattest places of the province; andhe shall do [that] which his fathers have not done, nor his fathers'fathers; he shall scatter among them the prey, and spoil, and riches:[yea,] and he shall forecast his devices against the strong holds, evenfor a time. 

{11:25} And he shall stir up his power and his courageagainst the king of the south with a great army; and the king of thesouth shall be stirred up to battle with a very great and mighty army;but he shall not stand: for they shall forecast devices against him.

{11:26} Yea, they that feed of the portion of his meat shall destroyhim, and his army shall overflow: and many shall fall down slain.

{11:27} And both these kings' hearts [shall be] to do mischief, andthey shall speak lies at one table; but it shall not prosper: for yetthe end [shall be] at the time appointed. 

{11:28} Then shall he returninto his land with great riches; and his heart [shall be] against theholy covenant; and he shall do [exploits,] and return to his own land.

{11:29} At the time appointed he shall return, and come toward thesouth; but it shall not be as the former, or as the latter.   

{11:30} For the ships of Chittim shall come against him: thereforehe shall be grieved, and return, and have indignation against the holycovenant: so shall he do; he shall even return, and have intelligencewith them that forsake the holy covenant. 

{11:31} And arms shall standon his part, and they shall pollute the sanctuary of strength, andshall take away the daily [sacrifice,] and they shall place theabomination that maketh desolate. 

{11:32} And such as do wickedlyagainst the covenant shall he corrupt by flatteries: but the peoplethat do know their God shall be strong, and do [exploits. ]

{11:33} Andthey that understand among the people shall instruct many: yet theyshall fall by the sword, and by flame, by captivity, and by spoil,[many] days. 

{11:34} Now when they shall fall, they shall be holpenwith a little help: but many shall cleave to them with flatteries.

{11:35} And [some] of them of understanding shall fall, to try them,and to purge, and to make [them] white, [even] to the time of the end:because [it is] yet for a time appointed. 

{11:36} And the king shall doaccording to his will; and he shall exalt himself, and magnify himselfabove every god, and shall speak marvellous things against the God ofgods, and shall prosper till the indignation be accomplished: for thatthat is determined shall be done. 

{11:37} Neither shall he regard theGod of his fathers, nor the desire of women, nor regard any god: for heshall magnify himself above all. 

{11:38} But in his estate shall hehonour the God of forces: and a god whom his fathers knew not shall hehonour with gold, and silver, and with precious stones, and pleasantthings. 

{11:39} Thus shall he do in the most strong holds with astrange god, whom he shall acknowledge [and] increase with glory: andhe shall cause them to rule over many, and shall divide the land forgain. 

{11:40} And at the time of the end shall the king of the southpush at him: and the king of the north shall come against him like awhirlwind, with chariots, and with horsemen, and with many ships; andhe shall enter into the countries, and shall overflow and pass over.

{11:41} He shall enter also into the glorious land, and many[countries] shall be overthrown: but these shall escape out of hishand, [even] Edom, and Moab, and the chief of the children of Ammon.

{11:42} He shall stretch forth his hand also upon the countries: andthe land of Egypt shall not escape. 

{11:43} But he shall have powerover the treasures of gold and of silver, and over all the preciousthings of Egypt: and the Libyans and the Ethiopians [shall be] at hissteps. 

{11:44} But tidings out of the east and out of the north shalltrouble him: therefore he shall go forth with great fury to destroy,and utterly to make away many. 

{11:45} And he shall plant thetabernacles of his palace between the seas in the glorious holymountain; yet he shall come to his end, and none shall help him.   

{12:1} And at that time shall Michael stand up, the great princewhich standeth for the children of thy people: and there shall be atime of trouble, such as never was since there was a nation [even] tothat same time: and at that time thy people shall be delivered, everyone that shall be found written in the book. 

{12:2} And many of themthat sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlastinglife, and some to shame [and] everlasting contempt. 

{12:3} And theythat be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament; and theythat turn many to righteousness as the stars for ever and ever. 

{12:4}But thou, O Daniel, shut up the words, and seal the book, [even] to thetime of the end: many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall beincreased.   

{12:5} Then I Daniel looked, and, behold, there stood other two, theone on this side of the bank of the river, and the other on that sideof the bank of the river. 

{12:6} And [one] said to the man clothed inlinen, which [was] upon the waters of the river, How long [shall it beto] the end of these wonders? 

{12:7} And I heard the man clothed inlinen, which [was] upon the waters of the river, when he held up hisright hand and his left hand unto heaven, and sware by him that livethfor ever that [it shall be] for a time, times, and an half; and when heshall have accomplished to scatter the power of the holy people, allthese [things] shall be finished. 

{12:8} And I heard, but I understoodnot: then said I, O my Lord, what [shall be] the end of these [things?]

{12:9} And he said, Go thy way, Daniel: for the words [are] closed upand sealed till the time of the end. 

{12:10} Many shall be purified,and made white, and tried; but the wicked shall do wickedly: and noneof the wicked shall understand; but the wise shall understand. 

{12:11}And from the time [that] the daily [sacrifice] shall be taken away, andthe abomination that maketh desolate set up, [there shall be] athousand two hundred and ninety days. 

{12:12} Blessed [is] he thatwaiteth, and cometh to the thousand three hundred and five and thirtydays. 

{12:13} But go thou thy way till the end [be:] for thou shaltrest, and stand in thy lot at the end of the days.
