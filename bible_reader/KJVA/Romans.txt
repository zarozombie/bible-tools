{The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans   

{1:1} Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called [to be] an apostle,separated unto the gospel of God, 

{1:2} (Which he had promised afore byhis prophets in the holy scriptures,) 

{1:3} Concerning his Son JesusChrist our Lord, which was made of the seed of David according to theflesh; 

{1:4} And declared [to be] the Son of God with power, accordingto the spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead: 

{1:5} Bywhom we have received grace and apostleship, for obedience to the faithamong all nations, for his name: 

{1:6} Among whom are ye also thecalled of Jesus Christ: 

{1:7} To all that be in Rome, beloved of God,called [to be] saints: Grace to you and peace from God our Father, andthe Lord Jesus Christ.   

{1:8} First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, thatyour faith is spoken of throughout the whole world. 

{1:9} For God is mywitness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, thatwithout ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers; 

{1:10}Making request, if by any means now at length I might have a prosperousjourney by the will of God to come unto you. 

{1:11} For I long to seeyou, that I may impart unto you some spiritual gift, to the end ye maybe established; 

{1:12} That is, that I may be comforted together withyou by the mutual faith both of you and me. 

{1:13} Now I would not haveyou ignorant, brethren, that oftentimes I purposed to come unto you,(but was let hitherto,) that I might have some fruit among you also,even as among other Gentiles. 

{1:14} I am debtor both to the Greeks,and to the Barbarians; both to the wise, and to the unwise. 

{1:15} So,as much as in me is, I am ready to preach the gospel to you that are atRome also. 

{1:16} For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for itis the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to theJew first, and also to the Greek. 

{1:17} For therein is therighteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written,The just shall live by faith.   

{1:18} For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against allungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth inunrighteousness; 

{1:19} Because that which may be known of God ismanifest in them; for God hath shewed [it] unto them. 

{1:20} For theinvisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearlyseen, being understood by the things that are made, [even] his eternalpower and Godhead; so that they are without excuse: 

{1:21} Becausethat, when they knew God, they glorified [him] not as God, neither werethankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolishheart was darkened. 

{1:22} Professing themselves to be wise, theybecame fools, 

{1:23} And changed the glory of the uncorruptible Godinto an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, andfourfooted beasts, and creeping things.   

{1:24} Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through thelusts of their own hearts, to dishonour their own bodies betweenthemselves: 

{1:25} Who changed the truth of God into a lie, andworshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who isblessed for ever. Amen. 

{1:26} For this cause God gave them up untovile affections: for even their women did change the natural use intothat which is against nature: 

{1:27} And likewise also the men, leavingthe natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another;men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving inthemselves that recompence of their error which was meet. 

{1:28} Andeven as they did not like to retain God in [their] knowledge, God gavethem over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are notconvenient; 

{1:29} Being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication,wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate,deceit, malignity; whisperers, 

{1:30} Backbiters, haters of God,despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient toparents, 

{1:31} Without understanding, covenantbreakers, withoutnatural affection, implacable, unmerciful: 

{1:32} Who knowing thejudgment of God, that they which commit such things are worthy ofdeath, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them.   

{2:1} Therefore thou art inexcusable, O man, whosoever thou art thatjudgest: for wherein thou judgest another, thou condemnest thyself; forthou that judgest doest the same things. 

{2:2} But we are sure that thejudgment of God is according to truth against them which commit suchthings. 

{2:3} And thinkest thou this, O man, that judgest them which dosuch things, and doest the same, that thou shalt escape the judgment ofGod? 

{2:4} Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness and forbearanceand longsuffering; not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee torepentance? 

{2:5} But after thy hardness and impenitent hearttreasurest up unto thyself wrath against the day of wrath andrevelation of the righteous judgment of God; 

{2:6} Who will render toevery man according to his deeds: 

{2:7} To them who by patientcontinuance in well doing seek for glory and honour and immortality,eternal life: 

{2:8} But unto them that are contentious, and do not obeythe truth, but obey unrighteousness, indignation and wrath, 

{2:9}Tribulation and anguish, upon every soul of man that doeth evil, of theJew first, and also of the Gentile; 

{2:10} But glory, honour, andpeace, to every man that worketh good, to the Jew first, and also tothe Gentile: 

{2:11} For there is no respect of persons with God. 

{2:12}For as many as have sinned without law shall also perish without law:and as many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law;

{2:13} (For not the hearers of the law [are] just before God, but thedoers of the law shall be justified. 

{2:14} For when the Gentiles,which have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law,these, having not the law, are a law unto themselves: 

{2:15} Which shewthe work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience alsobearing witness, and [their] thoughts the mean while accusing or elseexcusing one another;) 

{2:16} In the day when God shall judge thesecrets of men by Jesus Christ according to my gospel.   

{2:17} Behold, thou art called a Jew, and restest in the law, andmakest thy boast of God, 

{2:18} And knowest [his] will, and approvestthe things that are more excellent, being instructed out of the law;

{2:19} And art confident that thou thyself art a guide of the blind, alight of them which are in darkness, 

{2:20} An instructor of thefoolish, a teacher of babes, which hast the form of knowledge and ofthe truth in the law. 

{2:21} Thou therefore which teachest another,teachest thou not thyself? thou that preachest a man should not steal,dost thou steal? 

{2:22} Thou that sayest a man should not commitadultery, dost thou commit adultery? thou that abhorrest idols, dostthou commit sacrilege? 

{2:23} Thou that makest thy boast of the law,through breaking the law dishonourest thou God? 

{2:24} For the name ofGod is blasphemed among the Gentiles through you, as it is written.

{2:25} For circumcision verily profiteth, if thou keep the law: but ifthou be a breaker of the law, thy circumcision is made uncircumcision.

{2:26} Therefore if the uncircumcision keep the righteousness of thelaw, shall not his uncircumcision be counted for circumcision? 

{2:27}And shall not uncircumcision which is by nature, if it fulfil the law,judge thee, who by the letter and circumcision dost transgress the law?

{2:28} For he is not a Jew, which is one outwardly; neither [is that]circumcision, which is outward in the flesh: 

{2:29} But he [is] a Jew,which is one inwardly; and circumcision [is that] of the heart, in thespirit, [and] not in the letter; whose praise [is] not of men, but ofGod.   

{3:1} What advantage then hath the Jew? or what profit [is there] ofcircumcision? 

{3:2} Much every way: chiefly, because that unto themwere committed the oracles of God. 

{3:3} For what if some did notbelieve? shall their unbelief make the faith of God without effect?

{3:4} God forbid: yea, let God be true, but every man a liar; as it iswritten, That thou mightest be justified in thy sayings, and mightestovercome when thou art judged. 

{3:5} But if our unrighteousness commendthe righteousness of God, what shall we say? [Is] God unrighteous whotaketh vengeance? (I speak as a man) 

{3:6} God forbid: for then howshall God judge the world? 

{3:7} For if the truth of God hath moreabounded through my lie unto his glory; why yet am I also judged as asinner? 

{3:8} And not [rather,] (as we be slanderously reported, and assome affirm that we say,) Let us do evil, that good may come? whosedamnation is just.   

{3:9} What then? are we better [than they?] No, in no wise: for wehave before proved both Jews and Gentiles, that they are all under sin;

{3:10} As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one: 

{3:11}There is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after God.

{3:12} They are all gone out of the way, they are together becomeunprofitable; there is none that doeth good, no, not one. 

{3:13} Theirthroat [is] an open sepulchre; with their tongues they have useddeceit; the poison of asps [is] under their lips: 

{3:14} Whose mouth[is] full of cursing and bitterness: 

{3:15} Their feet [are] swift toshed blood: 

{3:16} Destruction and misery [are] in their ways: 

{3:17}And the way of peace have they not known: 

{3:18} There is no fear ofGod before their eyes.   

{3:19} Now we know that what things soever the law saith, it saithto them who are under the law: that every mouth may be stopped, and allthe world may become guilty before God. 

{3:20} Therefore by the deedsof the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by thelaw [is] the knowledge of sin.   

{3:21} But now the righteousness of God without the law ismanifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets; 

{3:22} Eventhe righteousness of God [which is] by faith of Jesus Christ unto alland upon all them that believe: for there is no difference: 

{3:23} Forall have sinned, and come short of the glory of God; 

{3:24} Beingjustified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in ChristJesus: 

{3:25} Whom God hath set forth [to be] a propitiation throughfaith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission ofsins that are past, through the forbearance of God; 

{3:26} To declare,[I say,] at this time his righteousness: that he might be just, and thejustifier of him which believeth in Jesus. 

{3:27} Where [is] boastingthen? It is excluded. By what law? of works? Nay: but by the law offaith. 

{3:28} Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faithwithout the deeds of the law. 

{3:29} [Is he] the God of the Jews only?[is he] not also of the Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles also: 

{3:30}Seeing [it is] one God, which shall justify the circumcision by faith,and uncircumcision through faith. 

{3:31} Do we then make void the lawthrough faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law.   

{4:1} What shall we say then that Abraham our father, as pertainingto the flesh, hath found? 

{4:2} For if Abraham were justified by works,he hath [whereof] to glory; but not before God. 

{4:3} For what saiththe scripture? Abraham believed God, and it was counted unto him forrighteousness. 

{4:4} Now to him that worketh is the reward not reckonedof grace, but of debt. 

{4:5} But to him that worketh not, but believethon him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted forrighteousness. 

{4:6} Even as David also describeth the blessedness ofthe man, unto whom God imputeth righteousness without works, 

{4:7}[Saying,] Blessed [are] they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whosesins are covered. 

{4:8} Blessed [is] the man to whom the Lord will notimpute sin. 

{4:9} [Cometh] this blessedness then upon the circumcision[only,] or upon the uncircumcision also? for we say that faith wasreckoned to Abraham for righteousness. 

{4:10} How was it then reckoned?when he was in circumcision, or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision,but in uncircumcision. 

{4:11} And he received the sign of circumcision,a seal of the righteousness of the faith which [he had yet] beinguncircumcised: that he might be the father of all them that believe,though they be not circumcised; that righteousness might be imputedunto them also: 

{4:12} And the father of circumcision to them who arenot of the circumcision only, but who also walk in the steps of thatfaith of our father Abraham, which [he had] being [yet] uncircumcised.

{4:13} For the promise, that he should be the heir of the world, [was]not to Abraham, or to his seed, through the law, but through therighteousness of faith. 

{4:14} For if they which are of the law [be]heirs, faith is made void, and the promise made of none effect: 

{4:15}Because the law worketh wrath: for where no law is, [there is] notransgression. 

{4:16} Therefore [it is] of faith, that [it might be] bygrace; to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed; not tothat only which is of the law, but to that also which is of the faithof Abraham; who is the father of us all, 

{4:17} (As it is written, Ihave made thee a father of many nations,) before him whom he believed,[even] God, who quickeneth the dead, and calleth those things which benot as though they were. 

{4:18} Who against hope believed in hope, thathe might become the father of many nations; according to that which wasspoken, So shall thy seed be. 

{4:19} And being not weak in faith, heconsidered not his own body now dead, when he was about an hundredyears old, neither yet the deadness of Sarah's womb: 

{4:20} Hestaggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but was strong infaith, giving glory to God; 

{4:21} And being fully persuaded that, whathe had promised, he was able also to perform. 

{4:22} And therefore itwas imputed to him for righteousness. 

{4:23} Now it was not written forhis sake alone, that it was imputed to him; 

{4:24} But for us also, towhom it shall be imputed, if we believe on him that raised up Jesus ourLord from the dead; 

{4:25} Who was delivered for our offences, and wasraised again for our justification.   

{5:1} Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with Godthrough our Lord Jesus Christ: 

{5:2} By whom also we have access byfaith into this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of theglory of God. 

{5:3} And not only [so,] but we glory in tribulationsalso: knowing that tribulation worketh patience; 

{5:4} And patience,experience; and experience, hope: 

{5:5} And hope maketh not ashamed;because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghostwhich is given unto us. 

{5:6} For when we were yet without strength, indue time Christ died for the ungodly. 

{5:7} For scarcely for arighteous man will one die: yet peradventure for a good man some wouldeven dare to die. 

{5:8} But God commendeth his love toward us, in that,while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. 

{5:9} Much more then,being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath throughhim. 

{5:10} For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God bythe death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved byhis life. 

{5:11} And not only [so,] but we also joy in God through ourLord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received the atonement.   

{5:12} Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, anddeath by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all havesinned: 

{5:13} (For until the law sin was in the world: but sin is notimputed when there is no law. 

{5:14} Nevertheless death reigned fromAdam to Moses, even over them that had not sinned after the similitudeof Adam's transgression, who is the figure of him that was to come.

{5:15} But not as the offence, so also [is] the free gift. For ifthrough the offence of one many be dead, much more the grace of God,and the gift by grace, [which is] by one man, Jesus Christ, hathabounded unto many. 

{5:16} And not as [it was] by one that sinned, [sois] the gift: for the judgment [was] by one to condemnation, but thefree gift [is] of many offences unto justification. 

{5:17} For if byone man's offence death reigned by one; much more they which receiveabundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in lifeby one, Jesus Christ.) 

{5:18} Therefore as by the offence of one[judgment came] upon all men to condemnation; even so by therighteousness of one [the free gift came] upon all men untojustification of life. 

{5:19} For as by one man's disobedience manywere made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be maderighteous. 

{5:20} Moreover the law entered, that the offence mightabound. But where sin abounded, grace did much more abound: 

{5:21} Thatas sin hath reigned unto death, even so might grace reign throughrighteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord.   

{6:1} What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that gracemay abound? 

{6:2} God forbid. How shall we, that are dead to sin, liveany longer therein? 

{6:3} Know ye not, that so many of us as werebaptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death? 

{6:4}Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like asChrist was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even sowe also should walk in newness of life. 

{6:5} For if we have beenplanted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also [in thelikeness of his] resurrection: 

{6:6} Knowing this, that our old man iscrucified with [him,] that the body of sin might be destroyed, thathenceforth we should not serve sin. 

{6:7} For he that is dead is freedfrom sin. 

{6:8} Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shallalso live with him: 

{6:9} Knowing that Christ being raised from thedead dieth no more; death hath no more dominion over him. 

{6:10} For inthat he died, he died unto sin once: but in that he liveth, he livethunto God. 

{6:11} Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeedunto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord. 

{6:12} Letnot sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey it inthe lusts thereof. 

{6:13} Neither yield ye your members [as]instruments of unrighteousness unto sin: but yield yourselves unto God,as those that are alive from the dead, and your members [as]instruments of righteousness unto God. 

{6:14} For sin shall not havedominion over you: for ye are not under the law, but under grace.

{6:15} What then? shall we sin, because we are not under the law, butunder grace? God forbid. 

{6:16} Know ye not, that to whom ye yieldyourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey;whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness? 

{6:17}But God be thanked, that ye were the servants of sin, but ye haveobeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you.

{6:18} Being then made free from sin, ye became the servants ofrighteousness. 

{6:19} I speak after the manner of men because of theinfirmity of your flesh: for as ye have yielded your members servantsto uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity; even so now yield yourmembers servants to righteousness unto holiness. 

{6:20} For when yewere the servants of sin, ye were free from righteousness. 

{6:21} Whatfruit had ye then in those things whereof ye are now ashamed? for theend of those things [is] death. 

{6:22} But now being made free fromsin, and become servants to God, ye have your fruit unto holiness, andthe end everlasting life. 

{6:23} For the wages of sin [is] death; butthe gift of God [is] eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.   

{7:1} Know ye not, brethren, (for I speak to them that know thelaw,) how that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth?

{7:2} For the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to [her]husband so long as he liveth; but if the husband be dead, she is loosedfrom the law of [her] husband. 

{7:3} So then if, while [her] husbandliveth, she be married to another man, she shall be called anadulteress: but if her husband be dead, she is free from that law; sothat she is no adulteress, though she be married to another man. 

{7:4}Wherefore, my brethren, ye also are become dead to the law by the bodyof Christ; that ye should be married to another, [even] to him who israised from the dead, that we should bring forth fruit unto God. 

{7:5}For when we were in the flesh, the motions of sins, which were by thelaw, did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death. 

{7:6} Butnow we are delivered from the law, that being dead wherein we wereheld; that we should serve in newness of spirit, and not [in] theoldness of the letter.   

{7:7} What shall we say then? [Is] the law sin? God forbid. Nay, Ihad not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust, except thelaw had said, Thou shalt not covet. 

{7:8} But sin, taking occasion bythe commandment, wrought in me all manner of concupiscence. For withoutthe law sin [was] dead. 

{7:9} For I was alive without the law once: butwhen the commandment came, sin revived, and I died. 

{7:10} And thecommandment, which [was ordained] to life, I found [to be] unto death.

{7:11} For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and byit slew [me. ]

{7:12} Wherefore the law [is] holy, and the commandmentholy, and just, and good. 

{7:13} Was then that which is good made deathunto me? God forbid. But sin, that it might appear sin, working deathin me by that which is good; that sin by the commandment might becomeexceeding sinful. 

{7:14} For we know that the law is spiritual: but Iam carnal, sold under sin. 

{7:15} For that which I do I allow not: forwhat I would, that do I not; but what I hate, that do I. 

{7:16} If thenI do that which I would not, I consent unto the law that [it is] good.

{7:17} Now then it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth inme. 

{7:18} For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth nogood thing: for to will is present with me; but [how] to perform thatwhich is good I find not. 

{7:19} For the good that I would I do not:but the evil which I would not, that I do. 

{7:20} Now if I do that Iwould not, it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.

{7:21} I find then a law, that, when I would do good, evil is presentwith me. 

{7:22} For I delight in the law of God after the inward man:

{7:23} But I see another law in my members, warring against the law ofmy mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is inmy members. 

{7:24} O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me fromthe body of this death? 

{7:25} I thank God through Jesus Christ ourLord. So then with the mind I myself serve the law of God; but with theflesh the law of sin.   

{8:1} [There is] therefore now no condemnation to them which are inChrist Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit. 

{8:2}For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me freefrom the law of sin and death. 

{8:3} For what the law could not do, inthat it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in thelikeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh:

{8:4} That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, whowalk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit. 

{8:5} For they that areafter the flesh do mind the things of the flesh; but they that areafter the Spirit the things of the Spirit. 

{8:6} For to be carnallyminded [is] death; but to be spiritually minded [is] life and peace.

{8:7} Because the carnal mind [is] enmity against God: for it is notsubject to the law of God, neither indeed can be. 

{8:8} So then theythat are in the flesh cannot please God. 

{8:9} But ye are not in theflesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you.Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his. 

{8:10}And if Christ [be] in you, the body [is] dead because of sin; but theSpirit [is] life because of righteousness. 

{8:11} But if the Spirit ofhim that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised upChrist from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by hisSpirit that dwelleth in you.   

{8:12} Therefore, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, tolive after the flesh. 

{8:13} For if ye live after the flesh, ye shalldie: but if ye through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, yeshall live. 

{8:14} For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, theyare the sons of God. 

{8:15} For ye have not received the spirit ofbondage again to fear; but ye have received the Spirit of adoption,whereby we cry, Abba, Father. 

{8:16} The Spirit itself beareth witnesswith our spirit, that we are the children of God: 

{8:17} And ifchildren, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if sobe that we suffer with [him,] that we may be also glorified together.   

{8:18} For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time [are]not worthy [to be compared] with the glory which shall be revealed inus. 

{8:19} For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for themanifestation of the sons of God. 

{8:20} For the creature was madesubject to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of him who hathsubjected [the same] in hope, 

{8:21} Because the creature itself alsoshall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the gloriousliberty of the children of God. 

{8:22} For we know that the wholecreation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now. 

{8:23} Andnot only [they,] but ourselves also, which have the firstfruits of theSpirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for theadoption, [to wit,] the redemption of our body. 

{8:24} For we are savedby hope: but hope that is seen is not hope: for what a man seeth, whydoth he yet hope for? 

{8:25} But if we hope for that we see not, [then]do we with patience wait for [it. ]

{8:26} Likewise the Spirit alsohelpeth our infirmities: for we know not what we should pray for as weought: but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groaningswhich cannot be uttered. 

{8:27} And he that searcheth the heartsknoweth what [is] the mind of the Spirit, because he makethintercession for the saints according to [the will of] God. 

{8:28} Andwe know that all things work together for good to them that love God,to them who are the called according to [his] purpose. 

{8:29} For whomhe did foreknow, he also did predestinate [to be] conformed to theimage of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren.

{8:30} Moreover whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and whomhe called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he alsoglorified. 

{8:31} What shall we then say to these things? If God [be]for us, who [can be] against us? 

{8:32} He that spared not his own Son,but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freelygive us all things? 

{8:33} Who shall lay any thing to the charge ofGod's elect? [It is] God that justifieth. 

{8:34} Who [is] he thatcondemneth? [It is] Christ that died, yea rather, that is risen again,who is even at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession forus. 

{8:35} Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? [shall]tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, orperil, or sword? 

{8:36} As it is written, For thy sake we are killedall the day long; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter. 

{8:37}Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him thatloved us. 

{8:38} For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, norangels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor thingsto come, 

{8:39} Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall beable to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus ourLord.   

{9:1} I say the truth in Christ, I lie not, my conscience alsobearing me witness in the Holy Ghost, 

{9:2} That I have great heavinessand continual sorrow in my heart. 

{9:3} For I could wish that myselfwere accursed from Christ for my brethren, my kinsmen according to theflesh: 

{9:4} Who are Israelites; to whom [pertaineth] the adoption, andthe glory, and the covenants, and the giving of the law, and theservice [of God,] and the promises; 

{9:5} Whose [are] the fathers, andof whom as concerning the flesh Christ [came,] who is over all, Godblessed for ever. Amen.   

{9:6} Not as though the word of God hath taken none effect. For they[are] not all Israel, which are of Israel: 

{9:7} Neither, because theyare the seed of Abraham, [are they] all children: but, In Isaac shallthy seed be called. 

{9:8} That is, They which are the children of theflesh, these [are] not the children of God: but the children of thepromise are counted for the seed. 

{9:9} For this [is] the word ofpromise, At this time will I come, and Sarah shall have a son. 

{9:10}And not only [this;] but when Rebecca also had conceived by one, [even]by our father Isaac; 

{9:11} (For [the children] being not yet born,neither having done any good or evil, that the purpose of God accordingto election might stand, not of works, but of him that calleth;) 

{9:12}It was said unto her, The elder shall serve the younger. 

{9:13} As itis written, Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated.   

{9:14} What shall we say then? [Is there] unrighteousness with God?God forbid. 

{9:15} For he saith to Moses, I will have mercy on whom Iwill have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will havecompassion. 

{9:16} So then [it is] not of him that willeth, nor of himthat runneth, but of God that sheweth mercy. 

{9:17} For the scripturesaith unto Pharaoh, Even for this same purpose have I raised thee up,that I might shew my power in thee, and that my name might be declaredthroughout all the earth. 

{9:18} Therefore hath he mercy on whom hewill [have mercy,] and whom he will he hardeneth. 

{9:19} Thou wilt saythen unto me, Why doth he yet find fault? For who hath resisted hiswill? 

{9:20} Nay but, O man, who art thou that repliest against God?Shall the thing formed say to him that formed [it,] Why hast thou mademe thus? 

{9:21} Hath not the potter power over the clay, of the samelump to make one vessel unto honour, and another unto dishonour? 

{9:22}[What] if God, willing to shew [his] wrath, and to make his powerknown, endured with much longsuffering the vessels of wrath fitted todestruction: 

{9:23} And that he might make known the riches of hisglory on the vessels of mercy, which he had afore prepared unto glory,

{9:24} Even us, whom he hath called, not of the Jews only, but also ofthe Gentiles? 

{9:25} As he saith also in Osee, I will call them mypeople, which were not my people; and her beloved, which was notbeloved. 

{9:26} And it shall come to pass, [that] in the place where itwas said unto them, Ye [are] not my people; there shall they be calledthe children of the living God. 

{9:27} Esaias also crieth concerningIsrael, Though the number of the children of Israel be as the sand ofthe sea, a remnant shall be saved: 

{9:28} For he will finish the work,and cut [it] short in righteousness: because a short work will the Lordmake upon the earth. 

{9:29} And as Esaias said before, Except the Lordof Sabaoth had left us a seed, we had been as Sodoma, and been madelike unto Gomorrha. 

{9:30} What shall we say then? That the Gentiles,which followed not after righteousness, have attained to righteousness,even the righteousness which is of faith. 

{9:31} But Israel, whichfollowed after the law of righteousness, hath not attained to the lawof righteousness. 

{9:32} Wherefore? Because [they sought it] not byfaith, but as it were by the works of the law. For they stumbled atthat stumblingstone; 

{9:33} As it is written, Behold, I lay in Sion astumblingstone and rock of offence: and whosoever believeth on himshall not be ashamed.   

{10:1} Brethren, my heart's desire and prayer to God for Israel is,that they might be saved. 

{10:2} For I bear them record that they havea zeal of God, but not according to knowledge. 

{10:3} For they beingignorant of God's righteousness, and going about to establish their ownrighteousness, have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness ofGod. 

{10:4} For Christ [is] the end of the law for righteousness toevery one that believeth. 

{10:5} For Moses describeth the righteousnesswhich is of the law, That the man which doeth those things shall liveby them. 

{10:6} But the righteousness which is of faith speaketh onthis wise, Say not in thine heart, Who shall ascend into heaven? (thatis, to bring Christ down [from above:]) 

{10:7} Or, Who shall descendinto the deep? (that is, to bring up Christ again from the dead.)

{10:8} But what saith it? The word is nigh thee, [even] in thy mouth,and in thy heart: that is, the word of faith, which we preach; 

{10:9}That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shaltbelieve in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thoushalt be saved. 

{10:10} For with the heart man believeth untorighteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.

{10:11} For the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall notbe ashamed. 

{10:12} For there is no difference between the Jew and theGreek: for the same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him.

{10:13} For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall besaved. 

{10:14} How then shall they call on him in whom they have notbelieved? and how shall they believe in him of whom they have notheard? and how shall they hear without a preacher? 

{10:15} And howshall they preach, except they be sent? as it is written, How beautifulare the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace, and bring gladtidings of good things! 

{10:16} But they have not all obeyed thegospel. For Esaias saith, Lord, who hath believed our report? 

{10:17}So then faith [cometh] by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.

{10:18} But I say, Have they not heard? Yes verily, their sound wentinto all the earth, and their words unto the ends of the world. 

{10:19}But I say, Did not Israel know? First Moses saith, I will provoke youto jealousy by [them that are] no people, [and] by a foolish nation Iwill anger you. 

{10:20} But Esaias is very bold, and saith, I was foundof them that sought me not; I was made manifest unto them that askednot after me. 

{10:21} But to Israel he saith, All day long I havestretched forth my hands unto a disobedient and gainsaying people.   

{11:1} I say then, Hath God cast away his people? God forbid. For Ialso am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, [of] the tribe ofBenjamin. 

{11:2} God hath not cast away his people which he foreknew.Wot ye not what the scripture saith of Elias? how he makethintercession to God against Israel, saying, 

{11:3} Lord, they havekilled thy prophets, and digged down thine altars; and I am left alone,and they seek my life. 

{11:4} But what saith the answer of God untohim? I have reserved to myself seven thousand men, who have not bowedthe knee to [the image of] Baal. 

{11:5} Even so then at this presenttime also there is a remnant according to the election of grace. 

{11:6}And if by grace, then [is it] no more of works: otherwise grace is nomore grace. But if [it be] of works, then is it no more grace:otherwise work is no more work.   

{11:7} What then? Israel hath not obtained that which he seekethfor; but the election hath obtained it, and the rest were blinded

{11:8} (According as it is written, God hath given them the spirit ofslumber, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should nothear;) unto this day. 

{11:9} And David saith, Let their table be made asnare, and a trap, and a stumblingblock, and a recompence unto them:

{11:10} Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see, and bow downtheir back alway. 

{11:11} I say then, Have they stumbled that theyshould fall? God forbid: but [rather] through their fall salvation [iscome] unto the Gentiles, for to provoke them to jealousy. 

{11:12} Nowif the fall of them [be] the riches of the world, and the diminishingof them the riches of the Gentiles; how much more their fulness?   

{11:13} For I speak to you Gentiles, inasmuch as I am the apostle ofthe Gentiles, I magnify mine office: 

{11:14} If by any means I mayprovoke to emulation [them which are] my flesh, and might save some ofthem. 

{11:15} For if the casting away of them [be] the reconciling ofthe world, what [shall] the receiving [of them be,] but life from thedead? 

{11:16} For if the firstfruit [be] holy, the lump [is] also[holy:] and if the root [be] holy, so [are] the branches. 

{11:17} Andif some of the branches be broken off, and thou, being a wild olivetree, wert graffed in among them, and with them partakest of the rootand fatness of the olive tree; 

{11:18} Boast not against the branches.But if thou boast, thou bearest not the root, but the root thee.

{11:19} Thou wilt say then, The branches were broken off, that I mightbe graffed in. 

{11:20} Well; because of unbelief they were broken off,and thou standest by faith. Be not highminded, but fear: 

{11:21} For ifGod spared not the natural branches, [take heed] lest he also spare notthee. 

{11:22} Behold therefore the goodness and severity of God: onthem which fell, severity; but toward thee, goodness, if thou continuein [his] goodness: otherwise thou also shalt be cut off. 

{11:23} Andthey also, if they abide not still in unbelief, shall be graffed in:for God is able to graff them in again. 

{11:24} For if thou wert cutout of the olive tree which is wild by nature, and wert graffedcontrary to nature into a good olive tree: how much more shall these,which be the natural [branches,] be graffed into their own olive tree?   

{11:25} For I would not, brethren, that ye should be ignorant ofthis mystery, lest ye should be wise in your own conceits; thatblindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fulness of theGentiles be come in. 

{11:26} And so all Israel shall be saved: as it iswritten, There shall come out of Sion the Deliverer, and shall turnaway ungodliness from Jacob: 

{11:27} For this [is] my covenant untothem, when I shall take away their sins. 

{11:28} As concerning thegospel, [they are] enemies for your sakes: but as touching theelection, [they are] beloved for the fathers' sakes. 

{11:29} For thegifts and calling of God [are] without repentance. 

{11:30} For as ye intimes past have not believed God, yet have now obtained mercy throughtheir unbelief: 

{11:31} Even so have these also now not believed, thatthrough your mercy they also may obtain mercy. 

{11:32} For God hathconcluded them all in unbelief, that he might have mercy upon all.   

{11:33} O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledgeof God! how unsearchable [are] his judgments, and his ways past findingout! 

{11:34} For who hath known the mind of the Lord? or who hath beenhis counsellor? 

{11:35} Or who hath first given to him, and it shall berecompensed unto him again? 

{11:36} For of him, and through him, and tohim, [are] all things: to whom [be] glory for ever. Amen.   

{12:1} I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God,that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable untoGod, [which is] your reasonable service. 

{12:2} And be not conformed tothis world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that yemay prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.   

{12:3} For I say, through the grace given unto me, to every man thatis among you, not to think [of himself] more highly than he ought tothink; but to think soberly, according as God hath dealt to every manthe measure of faith. 

{12:4} For as we have many members in one body,and all members have not the same office: 

{12:5} So we, [being] many,are one body in Christ, and every one members one of another. 

{12:6}Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us,whether prophecy, [let us prophesy] according to the proportion offaith; 

{12:7} Or ministry, [let us wait] on [our] ministering: or hethat teacheth, on teaching; 

{12:8} Or he that exhorteth, onexhortation: he that giveth, [let him do it] with simplicity; he thatruleth, with diligence; he that sheweth mercy, with cheerfulness.   

{12:9} [Let] love be without dissimulation. Abhor that which isevil; cleave to that which is good. 

{12:10} [Be] kindly affectioned oneto another with brotherly love; in honour preferring one another;

{12:11} Not slothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord;

{12:12} Rejoicing in hope; patient in tribulation; continuing instantin prayer; 

{12:13} Distributing to the necessity of saints; given tohospitality. 

{12:14} Bless them which persecute you: bless, and cursenot. 

{12:15} Rejoice with them that do rejoice, and weep with them thatweep. 

{12:16} [Be] of the same mind one toward another. Mind not highthings, but condescend to men of low estate. Be not wise in your ownconceits. 

{12:17} Recompense to no man evil for evil. Provide thingshonest in the sight of all men. 

{12:18} If it be possible, as much aslieth in you, live peaceably with all men. 

{12:19} Dearly beloved,avenge not yourselves, but [rather] give place unto wrath: for it iswritten, Vengeance [is] mine; I will repay, saith the Lord. 

{12:20}Therefore if thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give himdrink: for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head.

{12:21} Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.   

{13:1} Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For thereis no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God. 

{13:2}Whosoever therefore resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance ofGod: and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation. 

{13:3}For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil. Wilt thouthen not be afraid of the power? do that which is good, and thou shalthave praise of the same: 

{13:4} For he is the minister of God to theefor good. But if thou do that which is evil, be afraid; for he bearethnot the sword in vain: for he is the minister of God, a revenger to[execute] wrath upon him that doeth evil. 

{13:5} Wherefore [ye] mustneeds be subject, not only for wrath, but also for conscience sake.

{13:6} For for this cause pay ye tribute also: for they are God'sministers, attending continually upon this very thing. 

{13:7} Rendertherefore to all their dues: tribute to whom tribute [is due;] customto whom custom; fear to whom fear; honour to whom honour. 

{13:8} Owe noman any thing, but to love one another: for he that loveth another hathfulfilled the law. 

{13:9} For this, Thou shalt not commit adultery,Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear falsewitness, Thou shalt not covet; and if [there be] any other commandment,it is briefly comprehended in this saying, namely, Thou shalt love thyneighbour as thyself. 

{13:10} Love worketh no ill to his neighbour:therefore love [is] the fulfilling of the law. 

{13:11} And that,knowing the time, that now [it is] high time to awake out of sleep: fornow [is] our salvation nearer than when we believed. 

{13:12} The nightis far spent, the day is at hand: let us therefore cast off the worksof darkness, and let us put on the armour of light. 

{13:13} Let us walkhonestly, as in the day; not in rioting and drunkenness, not inchambering and wantonness, not in strife and envying. 

{13:14} But putye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not provision for the flesh, to[fulfil] the lusts [thereof.]   

{14:1} Him that is weak in the faith receive ye, [but] not todoubtful disputations. 

{14:2} For one believeth that he may eat allthings: another, who is weak, eateth herbs. 

{14:3} Let not him thateateth despise him that eateth not; and let not him which eateth notjudge him that eateth: for God hath received him. 

{14:4} Who art thouthat judgest another man's servant? to his own master he standeth orfalleth. Yea, he shall be holden up: for God is able to make him stand.

{14:5} One man esteemeth one day above another: another esteemeth everyday [alike.] Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind. 

{14:6}He that regardeth the day, regardeth [it] unto the Lord; and he thatregardeth not the day, to the Lord he doth not regard [it.] He thateateth, eateth to the Lord, for he giveth God thanks; and he thateateth not, to the Lord he eateth not, and giveth God thanks. 

{14:7}For none of us liveth to himself, and no man dieth to himself. 

{14:8}For whether we live, we live unto the Lord; and whether we die, we dieunto the Lord: whether we live therefore, or die, we are the Lord's.

{14:9} For to this end Christ both died, and rose, and revived, that hemight be Lord both of the dead and living. 

{14:10} But why dost thoujudge thy brother? or why dost thou set at nought thy brother? for weshall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ. 

{14:11} For it iswritten, [As] I live, saith the Lord, every knee shall bow to me, andevery tongue shall confess to God. 

{14:12} So then every one of usshall give account of himself to God. 

{14:13} Let us not thereforejudge one another any more: but judge this rather, that no man put astumblingblock or an occasion to fall in [his] brother's way. 

{14:14} Iknow, and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus, that [there is] nothingunclean of itself: but to him that esteemeth any thing to be unclean,to him [it is] unclean. 

{14:15} But if thy brother be grieved with[thy] meat, now walkest thou not charitably. Destroy not him with thymeat, for whom Christ died. 

{14:16} Let not then your good be evilspoken of: 

{14:17} For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; butrighteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost. 

{14:18} For hethat in these things serveth Christ [is] acceptable to God, andapproved of men. 

{14:19} Let us therefore follow after the things whichmake for peace, and things wherewith one may edify another. 

{14:20} Formeat destroy not the work of God. All things indeed [are] pure; but [itis] evil for that man who eateth with offence. 

{14:21} [It is] goodneither to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor [any thing] whereby thybrother stumbleth, or is offended, or is made weak. 

{14:22} Hast thoufaith? have [it] to thyself before God. Happy [is] he that condemnethnot himself in that thing which he alloweth. 

{14:23} And he thatdoubteth is damned if he eat, because [he eateth] not of faith: forwhatsoever [is] not of faith is sin.   

{15:1} We then that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of theweak, and not to please ourselves. 

{15:2} Let every one of us please[his] neighbour for [his] good to edification. 

{15:3} For even Christpleased not himself; but, as it is written, The reproaches of them thatreproached thee fell on me. 

{15:4} For whatsoever things were writtenaforetime were written for our learning, that we through patience andcomfort of the scriptures might have hope. 

{15:5} Now the God ofpatience and consolation grant you to be likeminded one toward anotheraccording to Christ Jesus: 

{15:6} That ye may with one mind [and] onemouth glorify God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.   

{15:7} Wherefore receive ye one another, as Christ also received usto the glory of God. 

{15:8} Now I say that Jesus Christ was a ministerof the circumcision for the truth of God, to confirm the promises[made] unto the fathers: 

{15:9} And that the Gentiles might glorify Godfor [his] mercy; as it is written, For this cause I will confess tothee among the Gentiles, and sing unto thy name. 

{15:10} And again hesaith, Rejoice, ye Gentiles, with his people. 

{15:11} And again, Praisethe Lord, all ye Gentiles; and laud him, all ye people. 

{15:12} Andagain, Esaias saith, There shall be a root of Jesse, and he that shallrise to reign over the Gentiles; in him shall the Gentiles trust.

{15:13} Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace inbelieving, that ye may abound in hope, through the power of the HolyGhost. 

{15:14} And I myself also am persuaded of you, my brethren, thatye also are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, able also toadmonish one another. 

{15:15} Nevertheless, brethren, I have writtenthe more boldly unto you in some sort, as putting you in mind, becauseof the grace that is given to me of God, 

{15:16} That I should be theminister of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles, ministering the gospel ofGod, that the offering up of the Gentiles might be acceptable, beingsanctified by the Holy Ghost. 

{15:17} I have therefore whereof I mayglory through Jesus Christ in those things which pertain to God.

{15:18} For I will not dare to speak of any of those things whichChrist hath not wrought by me, to make the Gentiles obedient, by wordand deed, 

{15:19} Through mighty signs and wonders, by the power of theSpirit of God; so that from Jerusalem, and round about unto Illyricum,I have fully preached the gospel of Christ. 

{15:20} Yea, so have Istrived to preach the gospel, not where Christ was named, lest I shouldbuild upon another man's foundation: 

{15:21} But as it is written, Towhom he was not spoken of, they shall see: and they that have not heardshall understand. 

{15:22} For which cause also I have been muchhindered from coming to you. 

{15:23} But now having no more place inthese parts, and having a great desire these many years to come untoyou; 

{15:24} Whensoever I take my journey into Spain, I will come toyou: for I trust to see you in my journey, and to be brought on my waythitherward by you, if first I be somewhat filled with your [company.]

{15:25} But now I go unto Jerusalem to minister unto the saints.

{15:26} For it hath pleased them of Macedonia and Achaia to make acertain contribution for the poor saints which are at Jerusalem.

{15:27} It hath pleased them verily; and their debtors they are. For ifthe Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things, theirduty is also to minister unto them in carnal things. 

{15:28} Whentherefore I have performed this, and have sealed to them this fruit, Iwill come by you into Spain. 

{15:29} And I am sure that, when I comeunto you, I shall come in the fulness of the blessing of the gospel ofChrist.   

{15:30} Now I beseech you, brethren, for the Lord Jesus Christ'ssake, and for the love of the Spirit, that ye strive together with mein [your] prayers to God for me; 

{15:31} That I may be delivered fromthem that do not believe in Judaea; and that my service which [I have]for Jerusalem may be accepted of the saints; 

{15:32} That I may comeunto you with joy by the will of God, and may with you be refreshed.

{15:33} Now the God of peace [be] with you all. Amen.   

{16:1} I commend unto you Phebe our sister, which is a servant ofthe church which is at Cenchrea: 

{16:2} That ye receive her in theLord, as becometh saints, and that ye assist her in whatsoever businessshe hath need of you: for she hath been a succourer of many, and ofmyself also. 

{16:3} Greet Priscilla and Aquila my helpers in ChristJesus: 

{16:4} Who have for my life laid down their own necks: unto whomnot only I give thanks, but also all the churches of the Gentiles.

{16:5} Likewise [greet] the church that is in their house. Salute mywellbeloved Epaenetus, who is the firstfruits of Achaia unto Christ.

{16:6} Greet Mary, who bestowed much labour on us. 

{16:7} SaluteAndronicus and Junia, my kinsmen, and my fellowprisoners, who are ofnote among the apostles, who also were in Christ before me. 

{16:8}Greet Amplias my beloved in the Lord. 

{16:9} Salute Urbane, our helperin Christ, and Stachys my beloved. 

{16:10} Salute Apelles approved inChrist. Salute them which are of Aristobulus' [household. ]

{16:11}Salute Herodion my kinsman. Greet them that be of the [household] ofNarcissus, which are in the Lord. 

{16:12} Salute Tryphena and Tryphosa,who labour in the Lord. Salute the beloved Persis, which laboured muchin the Lord. 

{16:13} Salute Rufus chosen in the Lord, and his motherand mine. 

{16:14} Salute Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermas, Patrobas, Hermes,and the brethren which are with them. 

{16:15} Salute Philologus, andJulia, Nereus, and his sister, and Olympas, and all the saints whichare with them. 

{16:16} Salute one another with an holy kiss. Thechurches of Christ salute you.   

{16:17} Now I beseech you, brethren, mark them which cause divisionsand offences contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned; and avoidthem. 

{16:18} For they that are such serve not our Lord Jesus Christ,but their own belly; and by good words and fair speeches deceive thehearts of the simple. 

{16:19} For your obedience is come abroad untoall [men.] I am glad therefore on your behalf: but yet I would have youwise unto that which is good, and simple concerning evil. 

{16:20} Andthe God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet shortly. The graceof our Lord Jesus Christ [be] with you. Amen.   

{16:21} Timotheus my workfellow, and Lucius, and Jason, andSosipater, my kinsmen, salute you. 

{16:22} I Tertius, who wrote [this]epistle, salute you in the Lord. 

{16:23} Gaius mine host, and of thewhole church, saluteth you. Erastus the chamberlain of the citysaluteth you, and Quartus a brother. 

{16:24} The grace of our LordJesus Christ [be] with you all. Amen.   

{16:25} Now to him that is of power to stablish you according to mygospel, and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelationof the mystery, which was kept secret since the world began, 

{16:26}But now is made manifest, and by the scriptures of the prophets,according to the commandment of the everlasting God, made known to allnations for the obedience of faith: 

{16:27} To God only wise, [be]glory through Jesus Christ for ever. Amen.
