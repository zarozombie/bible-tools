{Nahum   

{1:1} The burden of Nineveh. The book of the vision of Nahum theElkoshite. 

{1:2} God [is] jealous, and the LORD revengeth; the LORDrevengeth, and [is] furious; the LORD will take vengeance on hisadversaries, and he reserveth [wrath] for his enemies. 

{1:3} The LORD[is] slow to anger, and great in power, and will not at all acquit [thewicked:] the LORD hath his way in the whirlwind and in the storm, andthe clouds [are] the dust of his feet. 

{1:4} He rebuketh the sea, andmaketh it dry, and drieth up all the rivers: Bashan languisheth, andCarmel, and the flower of Lebanon languisheth. 

{1:5} The mountainsquake at him, and the hills melt, and the earth is burned at hispresence, yea, the world, and all that dwell therein. 

{1:6} Who canstand before his indignation? and who can abide in the fierceness ofhis anger? his fury is poured out like fire, and the rocks are throwndown by him. 

{1:7} The LORD [is] good, a strong hold in the day oftrouble; and he knoweth them that trust in him. 

{1:8} But with anoverrunning flood he will make an utter end of the place thereof, anddarkness shall pursue his enemies. 

{1:9} What do ye imagine against theLORD? he will make an utter end: affliction shall not rise up thesecond time. 

{1:10} For while [they be] folden together [as] thorns,and while they are drunken [as] drunkards, they shall be devoured asstubble fully dry. 

{1:11} There is [one] come out of thee, thatimagineth evil against the LORD, a wicked counsellor. 

{1:12} Thus saiththe LORD: Though [they be] quiet, and likewise many, yet thus shallthey be cut down, when he shall pass through. Though I have afflictedthee, I will afflict thee no more. 

{1:13} For now will I break his yokefrom off thee, and will burst thy bonds in sunder. 

{1:14} And the LORDhath given a commandment concerning thee, [that] no more of thy name besown: out of the house of thy gods will I cut off the graven image andthe molten image: I will make thy grave; for thou art vile. 

{1:15}Behold upon the mountains the feet of him that bringeth good tidings,that publisheth peace! O Judah, keep thy solemn feasts, perform thyvows: for the wicked shall no more pass through thee; he is utterly cutoff.   

{2:1} He that dasheth in pieces is come up before thy face: keep themunition, watch the way, make [thy] loins strong, fortify [thy] powermightily. 

{2:2} For the LORD hath turned away the excellency of Jacob,as the excellency of Israel: for the emptiers have emptied them out,and marred their vine branches. 

{2:3} The shield of his mighty men ismade red, the valiant men [are] in scarlet: the chariots [shall be]with flaming torches in the day of his preparation, and the fir treesshall be terribly shaken. 

{2:4} The chariots shall rage in the streets,they shall justle one against another in the broad ways: they shallseem like torches, they shall run like the lightnings. 

{2:5} He shallrecount his worthies: they shall stumble in their walk; they shall makehaste to the wall thereof, and the defence shall be prepared. 

{2:6} Thegates of the rivers shall be opened, and the palace shall be dissolved.

{2:7} And Huzzab shall be led away captive, she shall be brought up,and her maids shall lead [her] as with the voice of doves, taberingupon their breasts. 

{2:8} But Nineveh is of old like a pool of water:yet they shall flee away. Stand, stand, [shall they cry;] but noneshall look back. 

{2:9} Take ye the spoil of silver, take the spoil ofgold: for [there is] none end of the store [and] glory out of all thepleasant furniture. 

{2:10} She is empty, and void, and waste: and theheart melteth, and the knees smite together, and much pain [is] in allloins, and the faces of them all gather blackness. 

{2:11} Where [is]the dwelling of the lions, and the feeding place of the young lions,where the lion, [even] the old lion, walked, [and] the lion's whelp,and none made [them] afraid? 

{2:12} The lion did tear in pieces enoughfor his whelps, and strangled for his lionesses, and filled his holeswith prey, and his dens with ravin. 

{2:13} Behold, I [am] against thee,saith the LORD of hosts, and I will burn her chariots in the smoke, andthe sword shall devour thy young lions: and I will cut off thy preyfrom the earth, and the voice of thy messengers shall no more be heard.   

{3:1} Woe to the bloody city! it is all full of lies [and] robbery;the prey departeth not; 

{3:2} The noise of a whip, and the noise of therattling of the wheels, and of the pransing horses, and of the jumpingchariots. 

{3:3} The horseman lifteth up both the bright sword and theglittering spear: and [there is] a multitude of slain, and a greatnumber of carcases; and [there is] none end of [their] corpses; theystumble upon their corpses: 

{3:4} Because of the multitude of thewhoredoms of the wellfavoured harlot, the mistress of witchcrafts, thatselleth nations through her whoredoms, and families through herwitchcrafts. 

{3:5} Behold, I [am] against thee, saith the LORD ofhosts; and I will discover thy skirts upon thy face, and I will shewthe nations thy nakedness, and the kingdoms thy shame. 

{3:6} And I willcast abominable filth upon thee, and make thee vile, and will set theeas a gazingstock. 

{3:7} And it shall come to pass, [that] all they thatlook upon thee shall flee from thee, and say, Nineveh is laid waste:who will bemoan her? whence shall I seek comforters for thee? 

{3:8} Artthou better than populous No, that was situate among the rivers, [thathad] the waters round about it, whose rampart [was] the sea, [and] herwall [was] from the sea? 

{3:9} Ethiopia and Egypt [were] her strength,and [it was] infinite; Put and Lubim were thy helpers. 

{3:10} Yet [was]she carried away, she went into captivity: her young children also weredashed in pieces at the top of all the streets: and they cast lots forher honourable men, and all her great men were bound in chains. 

{3:11}Thou also shalt be drunken: thou shalt be hid, thou also shalt seekstrength because of the enemy. 

{3:12} All thy strong holds [shall belike] fig trees with the firstripe figs: if they be shaken, they shalleven fall into the mouth of the eater. 

{3:13} Behold, thy people in themidst of thee [are] women: the gates of thy land shall be set wide openunto thine enemies: the fire shall devour thy bars. 

{3:14} Draw theewaters for the siege, fortify thy strong holds: go into clay, and treadthe morter, make strong the brickkiln. 

{3:15} There shall the firedevour thee; the sword shall cut thee off, it shall eat thee up likethe cankerworm: make thyself many as the cankerworm, make thyself manyas the locusts. 

{3:16} Thou hast multiplied thy merchants above thestars of heaven: the cankerworm spoileth, and fleeth away. 

{3:17} Thycrowned [are] as the locusts, and thy captains as the greatgrasshoppers, which camp in the hedges in the cold day, [but] when thesun ariseth they flee away, and their place is not known where they[are. ]

{3:18} Thy shepherds slumber, O king of Assyria: thy noblesshall dwell [in the dust:] thy people is scattered upon the mountains,and no man gathereth [them. ]

{3:19} [There is] no healing of thybruise; thy wound is grievous: all that hear the bruit of thee shallclap the hands over thee: for upon whom hath not thy wickedness passedcontinually?
