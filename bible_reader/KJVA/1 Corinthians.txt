{The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians   

{1:1} Paul, called [to be] an apostle of Jesus Christ through thewill of God, and Sosthenes [our] brother, 

{1:2} Unto the church of Godwhich is at Corinth, to them that are sanctified in Christ Jesus,called [to be] saints, with all that in every place call upon the nameof Jesus Christ our Lord, both theirs and ours: 

{1:3} Grace [be] untoyou, and peace, from God our Father, and [from] the Lord Jesus Christ.   

{1:4} I thank my God always on your behalf, for the grace of Godwhich is given you by Jesus Christ; 

{1:5} That in every thing ye areenriched by him, in all utterance, and [in] all knowledge; 

{1:6} Evenas the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you: 

{1:7} So that ye comebehind in no gift; waiting for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ:

{1:8} Who shall also confirm you unto the end, [that ye may be]blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ. 

{1:9} God [is] faithful,by whom ye were called unto the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ ourLord.   

{1:10} Now I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord JesusChrist, that ye all speak the same thing, and [that] there be nodivisions among you; but [that] ye be perfectly joined together in thesame mind and in the same judgment. 

{1:11} For it hath been declaredunto me of you, my brethren, by them [which are of the house] of Chloe,that there are contentions among you. 

{1:12} Now this I say, that everyone of you saith, I am of Paul; and I of Apollos; and I of Cephas; andI of Christ. 

{1:13} Is Christ divided? was Paul crucified for you? orwere ye baptized in the name of Paul? 

{1:14} I thank God that Ibaptized none of you, but Crispus and Gaius; 

{1:15} Lest any should saythat I had baptized in mine own name. 

{1:16} And I baptized also thehousehold of Stephanas: besides, I know not whether I baptized anyother. 

{1:17} For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach thegospel: not with wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should bemade of none effect.   

{1:18} For the preaching of the cross is to them that perishfoolishness; but unto us which are saved it is the power of God. 

{1:19}For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and willbring to nothing the understanding of the prudent. 

{1:20} Where [is]the wise? where [is] the scribe? where [is] the disputer of this world?hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world? 

{1:21} For afterthat in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleasedGod by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe. 

{1:22}For the Jews require a sign, and the Greeks seek after wisdom: 

{1:23}But we preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews a stumblingblock, andunto the Greeks foolishness; 

{1:24} But unto them which are called,both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God.

{1:25} Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men; and theweakness of God is stronger than men. 

{1:26} For ye see your calling,brethren, how that not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty,not many noble, [are called: ]

{1:27} But God hath chosen the foolishthings of the world to confound the wise; and God hath chosen the weakthings of the world to confound the things which are mighty; 

{1:28} Andbase things of the world, and things which are despised, hath Godchosen, [yea,] and things which are not, to bring to nought things thatare: 

{1:29} That no flesh should glory in his presence. 

{1:30} But ofhim are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, andrighteousness, and sanctification, and redemption: 

{1:31} That,according as it is written, He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.   

{2:1} And I, brethren, when I came to you, came not with excellencyof speech or of wisdom, declaring unto you the testimony of God. 

{2:2}For I determined not to know any thing among you, save Jesus Christ,and him crucified. 

{2:3} And I was with you in weakness, and in fear,and in much trembling. 

{2:4} And my speech and my preaching [was] notwith enticing words of man's wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spiritand of power: 

{2:5} That your faith should not stand in the wisdom ofmen, but in the power of God. 

{2:6} Howbeit we speak wisdom among themthat are perfect: yet not the wisdom of this world, nor of the princesof this world, that come to nought: 

{2:7} But we speak the wisdom ofGod in a mystery, [even] the hidden [wisdom,] which God ordained beforethe world unto our glory: 

{2:8} Which none of the princes of this worldknew: for had they known [it,] they would not have crucified the Lordof glory. 

{2:9} But as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard,neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hathprepared for them that love him. 

{2:10} But God hath revealed [them]unto us by his Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, thedeep things of God. 

{2:11} For what man knoweth the things of a man,save the spirit of man which is in him? even so the things of Godknoweth no man, but the Spirit of God. 

{2:12} Now we have received, notthe spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God; that we mightknow the things that are freely given to us of God. 

{2:13} Which thingsalso we speak, not in the words which man's wisdom teacheth, but whichthe Holy Ghost teacheth; comparing spiritual things with spiritual.

{2:14} But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit ofGod: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know [them,]because they are spiritually discerned. 

{2:15} But he that is spiritualjudgeth all things, yet he himself is judged of no man. 

{2:16} For whohath known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct him? But we havethe mind of Christ.   

{3:1} And I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual,but as unto carnal, [even] as unto babes in Christ. 

{3:2} I have fedyou with milk, and not with meat: for hitherto ye were not able [tobear it,] neither yet now are ye able.   

{3:3} For ye are yet carnal: for whereas [there is] among youenvying, and strife, and divisions, are ye not carnal, and walk as men?

{3:4} For while one saith, I am of Paul; and another, I [am] ofApollos; are ye not carnal? 

{3:5} Who then is Paul, and who [is]Apollos, but ministers by whom ye believed, even as the Lord gave toevery man? 

{3:6} I have planted, Apollos watered; but God gave theincrease. 

{3:7} So then neither is he that planteth any thing, neitherhe that watereth; but God that giveth the increase. 

{3:8} Now he thatplanteth and he that watereth are one: and every man shall receive hisown reward according to his own labour. 

{3:9} For we are labourerstogether with God: ye are God's husbandry, [ye are] God's building.

{3:10} According to the grace of God which is given unto me, as a wisemasterbuilder, I have laid the foundation, and another buildeththereon. But let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon. 

{3:11}For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is JesusChrist. 

{3:12} Now if any man build upon this foundation gold, silver,precious stones, wood, hay, stubble; 

{3:13} Every man's work shall bemade manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it shall berevealed by fire; and the fire shall try every man's work of what sortit is. 

{3:14} If any man's work abide which he hath built thereupon, heshall receive a reward. 

{3:15} If any man's work shall be burned, heshall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as by fire.

{3:16} Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and [that] the Spiritof God dwelleth in you? 

{3:17} If any man defile the temple of God, himshall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which [temple] ye are.   

{3:18} Let no man deceive himself. If any man among you seemeth tobe wise in this world, let him become a fool, that he may be wise.

{3:19} For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it iswritten, He taketh the wise in their own craftiness. 

{3:20} And again,The Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain. 

{3:21}Therefore let no man glory in men. For all things are yours; 

{3:22}Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death,or things present, or things to come; all are yours; 

{3:23} And ye areChrist's; and Christ [is] God's.   

{4:1} Let a man so account of us, as of the ministers of Christ, andstewards of the mysteries of God. 

{4:2} Moreover it is required instewards, that a man be found faithful. 

{4:3} But with me it is a verysmall thing that I should be judged of you, or of man's judgment: yea,I judge not mine own self. 

{4:4} For I know nothing by myself; yet am Inot hereby justified: but he that judgeth me is the Lord. 

{4:5}Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who bothwill bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will makemanifest the counsels of the hearts: and then shall every man havepraise of God. 

{4:6} And these things, brethren, I have in a figuretransferred to myself and [to] Apollos for your sakes; that ye mightlearn in us not to think [of men] above that which is written, that noone of you be puffed up for one against another. 

{4:7} For who makeththee to differ [from another?] and what hast thou that thou didst notreceive? now if thou didst receive [it,] why dost thou glory, as ifthou hadst not received [it? ]

{4:8} Now ye are full, now ye are rich,ye have reigned as kings without us: and I would to God ye did reign,that we also might reign with you. 

{4:9} For I think that God hath setforth us the apostles last, as it were appointed to death: for we aremade a spectacle unto the world, and to angels, and to men. 

{4:10} We[are] fools for Christ's sake, but ye [are] wise in Christ; we [are]weak, but ye [are] strong; ye [are] honourable, but we [are] despised.

{4:11} Even unto this present hour we both hunger, and thirst, and arenaked, and are buffeted, and have no certain dwellingplace; 

{4:12} Andlabour, working with our own hands: being reviled, we bless; beingpersecuted, we suffer it: 

{4:13} Being defamed, we intreat: we are madeas the filth of the world, [and are] the offscouring of all things untothis day. 

{4:14} I write not these things to shame you, but as mybeloved sons I warn [you. ]

{4:15} For though ye have ten thousandinstructers in Christ, yet [have ye] not many fathers: for in ChristJesus I have begotten you through the gospel. 

{4:16} Wherefore Ibeseech you, be ye followers of me. 

{4:17} For this cause have I sentunto you Timotheus, who is my beloved son, and faithful in the Lord,who shall bring you into remembrance of my ways which be in Christ, asI teach every where in every church. 

{4:18} Now some are puffed up, asthough I would not come to you. 

{4:19} But I will come to you shortly,if the Lord will, and will know, not the speech of them which arepuffed up, but the power. 

{4:20} For the kingdom of God [is] not inword, but in power. 

{4:21} What will ye? shall I come unto you with arod, or in love, and [in] the spirit of meekness?   

{5:1} It is reported commonly [that there is] fornication among you,and such fornication as is not so much as named among the Gentiles,that one should have his father's wife. 

{5:2} And ye are puffed up, andhave not rather mourned, that he that hath done this deed might betaken away from among you. 

{5:3} For I verily, as absent in body, butpresent in spirit, have judged already, as though I were present,[concerning] him that hath so done this deed, 

{5:4} In the name of ourLord Jesus Christ, when ye are gathered together, and my spirit, withthe power of our Lord Jesus Christ, 

{5:5} To deliver such an one untoSatan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved inthe day of the Lord Jesus. 

{5:6} Your glorying [is] not good. Know yenot that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump? 

{5:7} Purge outtherefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, as ye areunleavened. For even Christ our passover is sacrificed for us: 

{5:8}Therefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with theleaven of malice and wickedness; but with the unleavened [bread] ofsincerity and truth. 

{5:9} I wrote unto you in an epistle not tocompany with fornicators: 

{5:10} Yet not altogether with thefornicators of this world, or with the covetous, or extortioners, orwith idolaters; for then must ye needs go out of the world. 

{5:11} Butnow I have written unto you not to keep company, if any man that iscalled a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or arailer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner; with such an one no not toeat. 

{5:12} For what have I to do to judge them also that are without?do not ye judge them that are within? 

{5:13} But them that are withoutGod judgeth. Therefore put away from among yourselves that wickedperson.   

{6:1} Dare any of you, having a matter against another, go to lawbefore the unjust, and not before the saints? 

{6:2} Do ye not know thatthe saints shall judge the world? and if the world shall be judged byyou, are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters? 

{6:3} Know ye notthat we shall judge angels? how much more things that pertain to thislife? 

{6:4} If then ye have judgments of things pertaining to thislife, set them to judge who are least esteemed in the church. 

{6:5} Ispeak to your shame. Is it so, that there is not a wise man among you?no, not one that shall be able to judge between his brethren? 

{6:6} Butbrother goeth to law with brother, and that before the unbelievers.

{6:7} Now therefore there is utterly a fault among you, because ye goto law one with another. Why do ye not rather take wrong? why do ye notrather [suffer yourselves to] be defrauded? 

{6:8} Nay, ye do wrong, anddefraud, and that [your] brethren. 

{6:9} Know ye not that theunrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived:neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, norabusers of themselves with mankind, 

{6:10} Nor thieves, nor covetous,nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit thekingdom of God. 

{6:11} And such were some of you: but ye are washed,but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the LordJesus, and by the Spirit of our God.   

{6:12} All things are lawful unto me, but all things are notexpedient: all things are lawful for me, but I will not be broughtunder the power of any. 

{6:13} Meats for the belly, and the belly formeats: but God shall destroy both it and them. Now the body [is] notfor fornication, but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body. 

{6:14}And God hath both raised up the Lord, and will also raise up us by hisown power. 

{6:15} Know ye not that your bodies are the members ofChrist? shall I then take the members of Christ, and make [them] themembers of an harlot? God forbid. 

{6:16} What? know ye not that hewhich is joined to an harlot is one body? for two, saith he, shall beone flesh. 

{6:17} But he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit.

{6:18} Flee fornication. Every sin that a man doeth is without thebody; but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body.

{6:19} What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost[which is] in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own?

{6:20} For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in yourbody, and in your spirit, which are God's.   

{7:1} Now concerning the things whereof ye wrote unto me: [It is]good for a man not to touch a woman. 

{7:2} Nevertheless, [to avoid]fornication, let every man have his own wife, and let every woman haveher own husband. 

{7:3} Let the husband render unto the wife duebenevolence: and likewise also the wife unto the husband. 

{7:4} Thewife hath not power of her own body, but the husband: and likewise alsothe husband hath not power of his own body, but the wife. 

{7:5} Defraudye not one the other, except [it be] with consent for a time, that yemay give yourselves to fasting and prayer; and come together again,that Satan tempt you not for your incontinency. 

{7:6} But I speak thisby permission, [and] not of commandment. 

{7:7} For I would that all menwere even as I myself. But every man hath his proper gift of God, oneafter this manner, and another after that.   

{7:8} I say therefore to the unmarried and widows, It is good forthem if they abide even as I. 

{7:9} But if they cannot contain, letthem marry: for it is better to marry than to burn. 

{7:10} And unto themarried I command, [yet] not I, but the Lord, Let not the wife departfrom [her] husband: 

{7:11} But and if she depart, let her remainunmarried, or be reconciled to [her] husband: and let not the husbandput away [his] wife. 

{7:12} But to the rest speak I, not the Lord: Ifany brother hath a wife that believeth not, and she be pleased to dwellwith him, let him not put her away. 

{7:13} And the woman which hath anhusband that believeth not, and if he be pleased to dwell with her, lether not leave him. 

{7:14} For the unbelieving husband is sanctified bythe wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband: elsewere your children unclean; but now are they holy. 

{7:15} But if theunbelieving depart, let him depart. A brother or a sister is not underbondage in such [cases:] but God hath called us to peace. 

{7:16} Forwhat knowest thou, O wife, whether thou shalt save [thy] husband? orhow knowest thou, O man, whether thou shalt save [thy] wife? 

{7:17} Butas God hath distributed to every man, as the Lord hath called everyone, so let him walk. And so ordain I in all churches. 

{7:18} Is anyman called being circumcised? let him not become uncircumcised. Is anycalled in uncircumcision? let him not be circumcised. 

{7:19}Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keepingof the commandments of God. 

{7:20} Let every man abide in the samecalling wherein he was called. 

{7:21} Art thou called [being] aservant? care not for it: but if thou mayest be made free, use [it]rather. 

{7:22} For he that is called in the Lord, [being] a servant, isthe Lord's freeman: likewise also he that is called, [being] free, isChrist's servant. 

{7:23} Ye are bought with a price; be not ye theservants of men. 

{7:24} Brethren, let every man, wherein he is called,therein abide with God.   

{7:25} Now concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord: yetI give my judgment, as one that hath obtained mercy of the Lord to befaithful. 

{7:26} I suppose therefore that this is good for the presentdistress, [I say,] that [it is] good for a man so to be. 

{7:27} Artthou bound unto a wife? seek not to be loosed. Art thou loosed from awife? seek not a wife. 

{7:28} But and if thou marry, thou hast notsinned; and if a virgin marry, she hath not sinned. Nevertheless suchshall have trouble in the flesh: but I spare you. 

{7:29} But this Isay, brethren, the time [is] short: it remaineth, that both they thathave wives be as though they had none; 

{7:30} And they that weep, asthough they wept not; and they that rejoice, as though they rejoicednot; and they that buy, as though they possessed not; 

{7:31} And theythat use this world, as not abusing [it:] for the fashion of this worldpasseth away. 

{7:32} But I would have you without carefulness. He thatis unmarried careth for the things that belong to the Lord, how he mayplease the Lord: 

{7:33} But he that is married careth for the thingsthat are of the world, how he may please [his] wife. 

{7:34} There isdifference [also] between a wife and a virgin. The unmarried womancareth for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in bodyand in spirit: but she that is married careth for the things of theworld, how she may please [her] husband. 

{7:35} And this I speak foryour own profit; not that I may cast a snare upon you, but for thatwhich is comely, and that ye may attend upon the Lord withoutdistraction. 

{7:36} But if any man think that he behaveth himselfuncomely toward his virgin, if she pass the flower of [her] age, andneed so require, let him do what he will, he sinneth not: let themmarry. 

{7:37} Nevertheless he that standeth stedfast in his heart,having no necessity, but hath power over his own will, and hath sodecreed in his heart that he will keep his virgin, doeth well. 

{7:38}So then he that giveth [her] in marriage doeth well; but he that giveth[her] not in marriage doeth better. 

{7:39} The wife is bound by the lawas long as her husband liveth; but if her husband be dead, she is atliberty to be married to whom she will; only in the Lord. 

{7:40} Butshe is happier if she so abide, after my judgment: and I think alsothat I have the Spirit of God.   

{8:1} Now as touching things offered unto idols, we know that we allhave knowledge. Knowledge puffeth up, but charity edifieth. 

{8:2} Andif any man think that he knoweth any thing, he knoweth nothing yet ashe ought to know. 

{8:3} But if any man love God, the same is known ofhim. 

{8:4} As concerning therefore the eating of those things that areoffered in sacrifice unto idols, we know that an idol [is] nothing inthe world, and that [there is] none other God but one. 

{8:5} For thoughthere be that are called gods, whether in heaven or in earth, (as therebe gods many, and lords many,) 

{8:6} But to us [there is but] one God,the Father, of whom [are] all things, and we in him; and one Lord JesusChrist, by whom [are] all things, and we by him. 

{8:7} Howbeit [thereis] not in every man that knowledge: for some with conscience of theidol unto this hour eat [it] as a thing offered unto an idol; and theirconscience being weak is defiled. 

{8:8} But meat commendeth us not toGod: for neither, if we eat, are we the better; neither, if we eat not,are we the worse. 

{8:9} But take heed lest by any means this liberty ofyours become a stumblingblock to them that are weak. 

{8:10} For if anyman see thee which hast knowledge sit at meat in the idol's temple,shall not the conscience of him which is weak be emboldened to eatthose things which are offered to idols; 

{8:11} And through thyknowledge shall the weak brother perish, for whom Christ died? 

{8:12}But when ye sin so against the brethren, and wound their weakconscience, ye sin against Christ. 

{8:13} Wherefore, if meat make mybrother to offend, I will eat no flesh while the world standeth, lest Imake my brother to offend.   

{9:1} Am I not an apostle? am I not free? have I not seen JesusChrist our Lord? are not ye my work in the Lord? 

{9:2} If I be not anapostle unto others, yet doubtless I am to you: for the seal of mineapostleship are ye in the Lord. 

{9:3} Mine answer to them that doexamine me is this, 

{9:4} Have we not power to eat and to drink? 

{9:5}Have we not power to lead about a sister, a wife, as well as otherapostles, and [as] the brethren of the Lord, and Cephas? 

{9:6} Or Ionly and Barnabas, have not we power to forbear working? 

{9:7} Whogoeth a warfare any time at his own charges? who planteth a vineyard,and eateth not of the fruit thereof? or who feedeth a flock, and eatethnot of the milk of the flock? 

{9:8} Say I these things as a man? orsaith not the law the same also? 

{9:9} For it is written in the law ofMoses, Thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treadeth out thecorn. Doth God take care for oxen? 

{9:10} Or saith he [it] altogetherfor our sakes? For our sakes, no doubt, [this] is written: that he thatploweth should plow in hope; and that he that thresheth in hope shouldbe partaker of his hope. 

{9:11} If we have sown unto you spiritualthings, [is it] a great thing if we shall reap your carnal things?

{9:12} If others be partakers of [this] power over you, [are] not werather? Nevertheless we have not used this power; but suffer allthings, lest we should hinder the gospel of Christ. 

{9:13} Do ye notknow that they which minister about holy things live [of the things] ofthe temple? and they which wait at the altar are partakers with thealtar? 

{9:14} Even so hath the Lord ordained that they which preach thegospel should live of the gospel. 

{9:15} But I have used none of thesethings: neither have I written these things, that it should be so doneunto me: for [it were] better for me to die, than that any man shouldmake my glorying void. 

{9:16} For though I preach the gospel, I havenothing to glory of: for necessity is laid upon me; yea, woe is untome, if I preach not the gospel! 

{9:17} For if I do this thingwillingly, I have a reward: but if against my will, a dispensation [ofthe gospel] is committed unto me. 

{9:18} What is my reward then?[Verily] that, when I preach the gospel, I may make the gospel ofChrist without charge, that I abuse not my power in the gospel. 

{9:19}For though I be free from all [men,] yet have I made myself servantunto all, that I might gain the more. 

{9:20} And unto the Jews I becameas a Jew, that I might gain the Jews; to them that are under the law,as under the law, that I might gain them that are under the law; 

{9:21}To them that are without law, as without law, (being not without law toGod, but under the law to Christ,) that I might gain them that arewithout law. 

{9:22} To the weak became I as weak, that I might gain theweak: I am made all things to all [men,] that I might by all means savesome. 

{9:23} And this I do for the gospel's sake, that I might bepartaker thereof with [you. ]

{9:24} Know ye not that they which run ina race run all, but one receiveth the prize? So run, that ye mayobtain. 

{9:25} And every man that striveth for the mastery is temperatein all things. Now they [do it] to obtain a corruptible crown; but wean incorruptible. 

{9:26} I therefore so run, not as uncertainly; sofight I, not as one that beateth the air: 

{9:27} But I keep under mybody, and bring [it] into subjection: lest that by any means, when Ihave preached to others, I myself should be a castaway.   

{10:1} Moreover, brethren, I would not that ye should be ignorant,how that all our fathers were under the cloud, and all passed throughthe sea; 

{10:2} And were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and inthe sea; 

{10:3} And did all eat the same spiritual meat; 

{10:4} And didall drink the same spiritual drink: for they drank of that spiritualRock that followed them: and that Rock was Christ. 

{10:5} But with manyof them God was not well pleased: for they were overthrown in thewilderness. 

{10:6} Now these things were our examples, to the intent weshould not lust after evil things, as they also lusted. 

{10:7} Neitherbe ye idolaters, as [were] some of them; as it is written, The peoplesat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play. 

{10:8} Neither let uscommit fornication, as some of them committed, and fell in one daythree and twenty thousand. 

{10:9} Neither let us tempt Christ, as someof them also tempted, and were destroyed of serpents. 

{10:10} Neithermurmur ye, as some of them also murmured, and were destroyed of thedestroyer. 

{10:11} Now all these things happened unto them forensamples: and they are written for our admonition, upon whom the endsof the world are come. 

{10:12} Wherefore let him that thinketh hestandeth take heed lest he fall. 

{10:13} There hath no temptation takenyou but such as is common to man: but God [is] faithful, who will notsuffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with thetemptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear [it.]   

{10:14} Wherefore, my dearly beloved, flee from idolatry. 

{10:15} Ispeak as to wise men; judge ye what I say. 

{10:16} The cup of blessingwhich we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ? Thebread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?

{10:17} For we [being] many are one bread, [and] one body: for we areall partakers of that one bread. 

{10:18} Behold Israel after the flesh:are not they which eat of the sacrifices partakers of the altar?

{10:19} What say I then? that the idol is any thing, or that which isoffered in sacrifice to idols is any thing? 

{10:20} But [I say,] thatthe things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to devils, andnot to God: and I would not that ye should have fellowship with devils.

{10:21} Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord, and the cup of devils: yecannot be partakers of the Lord's table, and of the table of devils.

{10:22} Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? are we stronger than he?

{10:23} All things are lawful for me, but all things are not expedient:all things are lawful for me, but all things edify not. 

{10:24} Let noman seek his own, but every man another's [wealth. ]

{10:25} Whatsoeveris sold in the shambles, [that] eat, asking no question for consciencesake: 

{10:26} For the earth [is] the Lord's, and the fulness thereof.

{10:27} If any of them that believe not bid you [to a feast,] and ye bedisposed to go; whatsoever is set before you, eat, asking no questionfor conscience sake. 

{10:28} But if any man say unto you, This isoffered in sacrifice unto idols, eat not for his sake that shewed it,and for conscience sake: for the earth [is] the Lord's, and the fulnessthereof: 

{10:29} Conscience, I say, not thine own, but of the other:for why is my liberty judged of another [man's] conscience? 

{10:30} Forif I by grace be a partaker, why am I evil spoken of for that for whichI give thanks? 

{10:31} Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, orwhatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God. 

{10:32} Give noneoffence, neither to the Jews, nor to the Gentiles, nor to the church ofGod: 

{10:33} Even as I please all [men] in all [things,] not seekingmine own profit, but the [profit] of many, that they may be saved.   

{11:1} Be ye followers of me, even as I also [am] of Christ.   

{11:2} Now I praise you, brethren, that ye remember me in allthings, and keep the ordinances, as I delivered [them] to you. 

{11:3}But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; andthe head of the woman [is] the man; and the head of Christ [is] God.

{11:4} Every man praying or prophesying, having [his] head covered,dishonoureth his head. 

{11:5} But every woman that prayeth orprophesieth with [her] head uncovered dishonoureth her head: for thatis even all one as if she were shaven. 

{11:6} For if the woman be notcovered, let her also be shorn: but if it be a shame for a woman to beshorn or shaven, let her be covered. 

{11:7} For a man indeed ought notto cover [his] head, forasmuch as he is the image and glory of God: butthe woman is the glory of the man. 

{11:8} For the man is not of thewoman; but the woman of the man. 

{11:9} Neither was the man created forthe woman; but the woman for the man. 

{11:10} For this cause ought thewoman to have power on [her] head because of the angels. 

{11:11}Nevertheless neither is the man without the woman, neither the womanwithout the man, in the Lord. 

{11:12} For as the woman [is] of the man,even so [is] the man also by the woman; but all things of God. 

{11:13}Judge in yourselves: is it comely that a woman pray unto God uncovered?

{11:14} Doth not even nature itself teach you, that, if a man have longhair, it is a shame unto him? 

{11:15} But if a woman have long hair, itis a glory to her: for [her] hair is given her for a covering. 

{11:16}But if any man seem to be contentious, we have no such custom, neitherthe churches of God.   

{11:17} Now in this that I declare [unto you] I praise [you] not,that ye come together not for the better, but for the worse. 

{11:18}For first of all, when ye come together in the church, I hear thatthere be divisions among you; and I partly believe it. 

{11:19} Forthere must be also heresies among you, that they which are approved maybe made manifest among you. 

{11:20} When ye come together thereforeinto one place, [this] is not to eat the Lord's supper. 

{11:21} For ineating every one taketh before [other] his own supper: and one ishungry, and another is drunken. 

{11:22} What? have ye not houses to eatand to drink in? or despise ye the church of God, and shame them thathave not? What shall I say to you? shall I praise you in this? I praise[you] not. 

{11:23} For I have received of the Lord that which also Idelivered unto you, That the Lord Jesus the [same] night in which hewas betrayed took bread: 

{11:24} And when he had given thanks, he brake[it,] and said, Take, eat: this is my body, which is broken for you:this do in remembrance of me. 

{11:25} After the same manner also [hetook] the cup, when he had supped, saying, This cup is the newtestament in my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink [it,] inremembrance of me. 

{11:26} For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink[this] cup, ye do shew the Lord's death till he come. 

{11:27} Whereforewhosoever shall eat this bread, and drink this cup of the Lord,unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord. 

{11:28}But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of [that] bread, anddrink of [that] cup. 

{11:29} For he that eateth and drinkethunworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself, not discerningthe Lord's body. 

{11:30} For this cause many [are] weak and sicklyamong you, and many sleep. 

{11:31} For if we would judge ourselves, weshould not be judged. 

{11:32} But when we are judged, we are chastenedof the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world. 

{11:33}Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, tarry one foranother. 

{11:34} And if any man hunger, let him eat at home; that yecome not together unto condemnation. And the rest will I set in orderwhen I come.   

{12:1} Now concerning spiritual [gifts,] brethren, I would not haveyou ignorant. 

{12:2} Ye know that ye were Gentiles, carried away untothese dumb idols, even as ye were led. 

{12:3} Wherefore I give you tounderstand, that no man speaking by the Spirit of God calleth Jesusaccursed: and [that] no man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by theHoly Ghost. 

{12:4} Now there are diversities of gifts, but the sameSpirit. 

{12:5} And there are differences of administrations, but thesame Lord. 

{12:6} And there are diversities of operations, but it isthe same God which worketh all in all. 

{12:7} But the manifestation ofthe Spirit is given to every man to profit withal. 

{12:8} For to one isgiven by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another the word ofknowledge by the same Spirit; 

{12:9} To another faith by the sameSpirit; to another the gifts of healing by the same Spirit; 

{12:10} Toanother the working of miracles; to another prophecy; to anotherdiscerning of spirits; to another [divers] kinds of tongues; to anotherthe interpretation of tongues: 

{12:11} But all these worketh that oneand the selfsame Spirit, dividing to every man severally as he will.

{12:12} For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all themembers of that one body, being many, are one body: so also [is]Christ. 

{12:13} For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body,whether [we be] Jews or Gentiles, whether [we be] bond or free; andhave been all made to drink into one Spirit. 

{12:14} For the body isnot one member, but many. 

{12:15} If the foot shall say, Because I amnot the hand, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body?

{12:16} And if the ear shall say, Because I am not the eye, I am not ofthe body; is it therefore not of the body? 

{12:17} If the whole body[were] an eye, where [were] the hearing? If the whole [were] hearing,where [were] the smelling? 

{12:18} But now hath God set the membersevery one of them in the body, as it hath pleased him. 

{12:19} And ifthey were all one member, where [were] the body? 

{12:20} But now [arethey] many members, yet but one body. 

{12:21} And the eye cannot sayunto the hand, I have no need of thee: nor again the head to the feet,I have no need of you. 

{12:22} Nay, much more those members of thebody, which seem to be more feeble, are necessary: 

{12:23} And those[members] of the body, which we think to be less honourable, upon thesewe bestow more abundant honour; and our uncomely [parts] have moreabundant comeliness. 

{12:24} For our comely [parts] have no need: butGod hath tempered the body together, having given more abundant honourto that [part] which lacked: 

{12:25} That there should be no schism inthe body; but [that] the members should have the same care one foranother. 

{12:26} And whether one member suffer, all the members sufferwith it; or one member be honoured, all the members rejoice with it.

{12:27} Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular.

{12:28} And God hath set some in the church, first apostles,secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then giftsof healings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues. 

{12:29} [Are]all apostles? [are] all prophets? [are] all teachers? [are] all workersof miracles? 

{12:30} Have all the gifts of healing? do all speak withtongues? do all interpret? 

{12:31} But covet earnestly the best gifts:and yet shew I unto you a more excellent way.   

{13:1} Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, andhave not charity, I am become [as ]sounding brass, or a tinklingcymbal. 

{13:2} And though I have [the gift of] prophecy, and understandall mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so thatI could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing. 

{13:3}And though I bestow all my goods to feed [the poor,] and though I givemy body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.

{13:4} Charity suffereth long, [and] is kind; charity envieth not;charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up, 

{13:5} Doth not behaveitself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinkethno evil; 

{13:6} Rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth;

{13:7} Beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things,endureth all things. 

{13:8} Charity never faileth: but whether [therebe] prophecies, they shall fail; whether [there be] tongues, they shallcease; whether [there be] knowledge, it shall vanish away. 

{13:9} Forwe know in part, and we prophesy in part. 

{13:10} But when that whichis perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away.

{13:11} When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as achild, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put awaychildish things. 

{13:12} For now we see through a glass, darkly; butthen face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even asalso I am known. 

{13:13} And now abideth faith, hope, charity, thesethree; but the greatest of these [is] charity.   

{14:1} Follow after charity, and desire spiritual [gifts,] butrather that ye may prophesy. 

{14:2} For he that speaketh in an[unknown] tongue speaketh not unto men, but unto God: for no manunderstandeth [him;] howbeit in the spirit he speaketh mysteries.

{14:3} But he that prophesieth speaketh unto men [to] edification, andexhortation, and comfort. 

{14:4} He that speaketh in an [unknown]tongue edifieth himself; but he that prophesieth edifieth the church.

{14:5} I would that ye all spake with tongues, but rather that yeprophesied: for greater [is] he that prophesieth than he that speakethwith tongues, except he interpret, that the church may receiveedifying. 

{14:6} Now, brethren, if I come unto you speaking withtongues, what shall I profit you, except I shall speak to you either byrevelation, or by knowledge, or by prophesying, or by doctrine? 

{14:7}And even things without life giving sound, whether pipe or harp, exceptthey give a distinction in the sounds, how shall it be known what ispiped or harped? 

{14:8} For if the trumpet give an uncertain sound, whoshall prepare himself to the battle? 

{14:9} So likewise ye, except yeutter by the tongue words easy to be understood, how shall it be knownwhat is spoken? for ye shall speak into the air. 

{14:10} There are, itmay be, so many kinds of voices in the world, and none of them [is]without signification. 

{14:11} Therefore if I know not the meaning ofthe voice, I shall be unto him that speaketh a barbarian, and he thatspeaketh [shall be] a barbarian unto me. 

{14:12} Even so ye, forasmuchas ye are zealous of spiritual [gifts,] seek that ye may excel to theedifying of the church. 

{14:13} Wherefore let him that speaketh in an[unknown] tongue pray that he may interpret. 

{14:14} For if I pray inan [unknown] tongue, my spirit prayeth, but my understanding isunfruitful. 

{14:15} What is it then? I will pray with the spirit, and Iwill pray with the understanding also: I will sing with the spirit, andI will sing with the understanding also. 

{14:16} Else when thou shaltbless with the spirit, how shall he that occupieth the room of theunlearned say Amen at thy giving of thanks, seeing he understandeth notwhat thou sayest? 

{14:17} For thou verily givest thanks well, but theother is not edified. 

{14:18} I thank my God, I speak with tongues morethan ye all: 

{14:19} Yet in the church I had rather speak five wordswith my understanding, that [by my voice] I might teach others also,than ten thousand words in an [unknown] tongue. 

{14:20} Brethren, benot children in understanding: howbeit in malice be ye children, but inunderstanding be men. 

{14:21} In the law it is written, With [men of]other tongues and other lips will I speak unto this people; and yet forall that will they not hear me, saith the Lord. 

{14:22} Whereforetongues are for a sign, not to them that believe, but to them thatbelieve not: but prophesying [serveth] not for them that believe not,but for them which believe. 

{14:23} If therefore the whole church become together into one place, and all speak with tongues, and therecome in [those that are] unlearned, or unbelievers, will they not saythat ye are mad? 

{14:24} But if all prophesy, and there come in onethat believeth not, or [one] unlearned, he is convinced of all, he isjudged of all: 

{14:25} And thus are the secrets of his heart mademanifest; and so falling down on [his] face he will worship God, andreport that God is in you of a truth. 

{14:26} How is it then, brethren?when ye come together, every one of you hath a psalm, hath a doctrine,hath a tongue, hath a revelation, hath an interpretation. Let allthings be done unto edifying. 

{14:27} If any man speak in an [unknown]tongue, [let it be] by two, or at the most [by] three, and [that] bycourse; and let one interpret. 

{14:28} But if there be no interpreter,let him keep silence in the church; and let him speak to himself, andto God. 

{14:29} Let the prophets speak two or three, and let the otherjudge. 

{14:30} If [any thing] be revealed to another that sitteth by,let the first hold his peace. 

{14:31} For ye may all prophesy one byone, that all may learn, and all may be comforted. 

{14:32} And thespirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets. 

{14:33} For God isnot [the author] of confusion, but of peace, as in all churches of thesaints. 

{14:34} Let your women keep silence in the churches: for it isnot permitted unto them to speak; but [they are commanded] to be underobedience, as also saith the law. 

{14:35} And if they will learn anything, let them ask their husbands at home: for it is a shame for womento speak in the church. 

{14:36} What? came the word of God out fromyou? or came it unto you only? 

{14:37} If any man think himself to be aprophet, or spiritual, let him acknowledge that the things that I writeunto you are the commandments of the Lord. 

{14:38} But if any man beignorant, let him be ignorant. 

{14:39} Wherefore, brethren, covet toprophesy, and forbid not to speak with tongues. 

{14:40} Let all thingsbe done decently and in order.   

{15:1} Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which Ipreached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand;

{15:2} By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preachedunto you, unless ye have believed in vain. 

{15:3} For I delivered untoyou first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died forour sins according to the scriptures; 

{15:4} And that he was buried,and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:

{15:5} And that he was seen of Cephas, then of the twelve: 

{15:6} Afterthat, he was seen of above five hundred brethren at once; of whom thegreater part remain unto this present, but some are fallen asleep.

{15:7} After that, he was seen of James; then of all the apostles.

{15:8} And last of all he was seen of me also, as of one born out ofdue time. 

{15:9} For I am the least of the apostles, that am not meetto be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.

{15:10} But by the grace of God I am what I am: and his grace [whichwas bestowed] upon me was not in vain; but I laboured more abundantlythan they all: yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.

{15:11} Therefore whether [it were] I or they, so we preach, and so yebelieved. 

{15:12} Now if Christ be preached that he rose from the dead,how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead?

{15:13} But if there be no resurrection of the dead, then is Christ notrisen: 

{15:14} And if Christ be not risen, then [is] our preachingvain, and your faith [is] also vain. 

{15:15} Yea, and we are foundfalse witnesses of God; because we have testified of God that he raisedup Christ: whom he raised not up, if so be that the dead rise not.

{15:16} For if the dead rise not, then is not Christ raised: 

{15:17}And if Christ be not raised, your faith [is] vain; ye are yet in yoursins. 

{15:18} Then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ areperished. 

{15:19} If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we areof all men most miserable. 

{15:20} But now is Christ risen from thedead, [and] become the firstfruits of them that slept. 

{15:21} Forsince by man [came] death, by man [came] also the resurrection of thedead. 

{15:22} For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all bemade alive. 

{15:23} But every man in his own order: Christ thefirstfruits; afterward they that are Christ's at his coming. 

{15:24}Then [cometh] the end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom toGod, even the Father; when he shall have put down all rule and allauthority and power. 

{15:25} For he must reign, till he hath put allenemies under his feet. 

{15:26} The last enemy [that] shall bedestroyed [is] death. 

{15:27} For he hath put all things under hisfeet. But when he saith, all things are put under [him, it is] manifestthat he is excepted, which did put all things under him. 

{15:28} Andwhen all things shall be subdued unto him, then shall the Son alsohimself be subject unto him that put all things under him, that God maybe all in all. 

{15:29} Else what shall they do which are baptized forthe dead, if the dead rise not at all? why are they then baptized forthe dead? 

{15:30} And why stand we in jeopardy every hour? 

{15:31} Iprotest by your rejoicing which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I diedaily. 

{15:32} If after the manner of men I have fought with beasts atEphesus, what advantageth it me, if the dead rise not? let us eat anddrink; for to morrow we die. 

{15:33} Be not deceived: evilcommunications corrupt good manners. 

{15:34} Awake to righteousness,and sin not; for some have not the knowledge of God: I speak [this] toyour shame.   

{15:35} But some [man] will say, How are the dead raised up? andwith what body do they come? 

{15:36} [Thou] fool, that which thousowest is not quickened, except it die: 

{15:37} And that which thousowest, thou sowest not that body that shall be, but bare grain, it maychance of wheat, or of some other [grain: ]

{15:38} But God giveth it abody as it hath pleased him, and to every seed his own body. 

{15:39}All flesh [is] not the same flesh: but [there is] one [kind of] fleshof men, another flesh of beasts, another of fishes, [and] another ofbirds. 

{15:40} [There are] also celestial bodies, and bodiesterrestrial: but the glory of the celestial [is] one, and the [glory]of the terrestrial [is] another. 

{15:41} [There is] one glory of thesun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars: for[one] star differeth from [another] star in glory. 

{15:42} So also [is]the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised inincorruption: 

{15:43} It is sown in dishonour; it is raised in glory:it is sown in weakness; it is raised in power: 

{15:44} It is sown anatural body; it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body,and there is a spiritual body. 

{15:45} And so it is written, The firstman Adam was made a living soul; the last Adam [was made] a quickeningspirit. 

{15:46} Howbeit that [was] not first which is spiritual, butthat which is natural; and afterward that which is spiritual. 

{15:47}The first man [is] of the earth, earthy: the second man [is] the Lordfrom heaven. 

{15:48} As [is] the earthy, such [are] they also that areearthy: and as [is] the heavenly, such [are] they also that areheavenly. 

{15:49} And as we have borne the image of the earthy, weshall also bear the image of the heavenly. 

{15:50} Now this I say,brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God;neither doth corruption inherit incorruption. 

{15:51} Behold, I shewyou a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed,

{15:52} In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: forthe trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible,and we shall be changed. 

{15:53} For this corruptible must put onincorruption, and this mortal [must] put on immortality. 

{15:54} Sowhen this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortalshall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the sayingthat is written, Death is swallowed up in victory. 

{15:55} O death,where [is] thy sting? O grave, where [is] thy victory? 

{15:56} Thesting of death [is] sin; and the strength of sin [is] the law. 

{15:57}But thanks [be] to God, which giveth us the victory through our LordJesus Christ. 

{15:58} Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye stedfast,unmovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as yeknow that your labour is not in vain in the Lord.   

{16:1} Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I have givenorder to the churches of Galatia, even so do ye. 

{16:2} Upon the first[day] of the week let every one of you lay by him in store, as [God]hath prospered him, that there be no gatherings when I come. 

{16:3} Andwhen I come, whomsoever ye shall approve by [your] letters, them will Isend to bring your liberality unto Jerusalem. 

{16:4} And if it be meetthat I go also, they shall go with me. 

{16:5} Now I will come unto you,when I shall pass through Macedonia: for I do pass through Macedonia.

{16:6} And it may be that I will abide, yea, and winter with you, thatye may bring me on my journey whithersoever I go. 

{16:7} For I will notsee you now by the way; but I trust to tarry a while with you, if theLord permit. 

{16:8} But I will tarry at Ephesus until Pentecost. 

{16:9}For a great door and effectual is opened unto me, and [there are] manyadversaries. 

{16:10} Now if Timotheus come, see that he may be with youwithout fear: for he worketh the work of the Lord, as I also [do.]

{16:11} Let no man therefore despise him: but conduct him forth inpeace, that he may come unto me: for I look for him with the brethren.

{16:12} As touching [our] brother Apollos, I greatly desired him tocome unto you with the brethren: but his will was not at all to come atthis time; but he will come when he shall have convenient time. 

{16:13}Watch ye, stand fast in the faith, quit you like men, be strong.

{16:14} Let all your things be done with charity. 

{16:15} I beseechyou, brethren, (ye know the house of Stephanas, that it is thefirstfruits of Achaia, and [that] they have addicted themselves to theministry of the saints,) 

{16:16} That ye submit yourselves unto such,and to every one that helpeth with [us,] and laboureth. 

{16:17} I amglad of the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus: for thatwhich was lacking on your part they have supplied. 

{16:18} For theyhave refreshed my spirit and yours: therefore acknowledge ye them thatare such.   

{16:19} The churches of Asia salute you. Aquila and Priscilla saluteyou much in the Lord, with the church that is in their house. 

{16:20}All the brethren greet you. Greet ye one another with an holy kiss.

{16:21} The salutation of [me] Paul with mine own hand. 

{16:22} If anyman love not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be Anathema Maranatha.

{16:23} The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ [be] with you. 

{16:24} Mylove [be] with you all in Christ Jesus. Amen.
