{The Book of Nehemiah   

{1:1} The words of Nehemiah the son of Hachaliah. And it came topass in the month Chisleu, in the twentieth year, as I was in Shushanthe palace, 

{1:2} That Hanani, one of my brethren, came, he and[certain] men of Judah; and I asked them concerning the Jews that hadescaped, which were left of the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem.

{1:3} And they said unto me, The remnant that are left of the captivitythere in the province [are] in great affliction and reproach: the wallof Jerusalem also [is] broken down, and the gates thereof are burnedwith fire.   

{1:4} And it came to pass, when I heard these words, that I sat downand wept, and mourned [certain] days, and fasted, and prayed before theGod of heaven, 

{1:5} And said, I beseech thee, O LORD God of heaven,the great and terrible God, that keepeth covenant and mercy for themthat love him and observe his commandments: 

{1:6} Let thine ear now beattentive, and thine eyes open, that thou mayest hear the prayer of thyservant, which I pray before thee now, day and night, for the childrenof Israel thy servants, and confess the sins of the children of Israel,which we have sinned against thee: both I and my father's house havesinned. 

{1:7} We have dealt very corruptly against thee, and have notkept the commandments, nor the statutes, nor the judgments, which thoucommandedst thy servant Moses. 

{1:8} Remember, I beseech thee, the wordthat thou commandedst thy servant Moses, saying, [If] ye transgress, Iwill scatter you abroad among the nations: 

{1:9} But [if] ye turn untome, and keep my commandments, and do them; though there were of youcast out unto the uttermost part of the heaven, [yet] will I gatherthem from thence, and will bring them unto the place that I have chosento set my name there. 

{1:10} Now these [are] thy servants and thypeople, whom thou hast redeemed by thy great power, and by thy stronghand. 

{1:11} O Lord, I beseech thee, let now thine ear be attentive tothe prayer of thy servant, and to the prayer of thy servants, whodesire to fear thy name: and prosper, I pray thee, thy servant thisday, and grant him mercy in the sight of this man. For I was the king'scupbearer.   

{2:1} And it came to pass in the month Nisan, in the twentieth yearof Artaxerxes the king, [that] wine [was] before him: and I took up thewine, and gave [it] unto the king. Now I had not been [beforetime] sadin his presence. 

{2:2} Wherefore the king said unto me, Why [is] thycountenance sad, seeing thou [art] not sick? this [is] nothing [else]but sorrow of heart. Then I was very sore afraid, 

{2:3} And said untothe king, Let the king live for ever: why should not my countenance besad, when the city, the place of my fathers' sepulchres, [lieth] waste,and the gates thereof are consumed with fire? 

{2:4} Then the king saidunto me, For what dost thou make request? So I prayed to the God ofheaven. 

{2:5} And I said unto the king, If it please the king, and ifthy servant have found favour in thy sight, that thou wouldest send meunto Judah, unto the city of my fathers' sepulchres, that I may buildit. 

{2:6} And the king said unto me, (the queen also sitting by him,)For how long shall thy journey be? and when wilt thou return? So itpleased the king to send me; and I set him a time. 

{2:7} Moreover Isaid unto the king, If it please the king, let letters be given me tothe governors beyond the river, that they may convey me over till Icome into Judah; 

{2:8} And a letter unto Asaph the keeper of the king'sforest, that he may give me timber to make beams for the gates of thepalace which [appertained] to the house, and for the wall of the city,and for the house that I shall enter into. And the king granted me,according to the good hand of my God upon me.   

{2:9} Then I came to the governors beyond the river, and gave themthe king's letters. Now the king had sent captains of the army andhorsemen with me. 

{2:10} When Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah theservant, the Ammonite, heard [of it,] it grieved them exceedingly thatthere was come a man to seek the welfare of the children of Israel.

{2:11} So I came to Jerusalem, and was there three days.   

{2:12} And I arose in the night, I and some few men with me; neithertold I [any] man what my God had put in my heart to do at Jerusalem:neither [was there any] beast with me, save the beast that I rode upon.

{2:13} And I went out by night by the gate of the valley, even beforethe dragon well, and to the dung port, and viewed the walls ofJerusalem, which were broken down, and the gates thereof were consumedwith fire. 

{2:14} Then I went on to the gate of the fountain, and tothe king's pool: but [there was] no place for the beast [that was]under me to pass. 

{2:15} Then went I up in the night by the brook, andviewed the wall, and turned back, and entered by the gate of thevalley, and [so] returned. 

{2:16} And the rulers knew not whither Iwent, or what I did; neither had I as yet told [it] to the Jews, nor tothe priests, nor to the nobles, nor to the rulers, nor to the rest thatdid the work.   

{2:17} Then said I unto them, Ye see the distress that we [are] in,how Jerusalem [lieth] waste, and the gates thereof are burned withfire: come, and let us build up the wall of Jerusalem, that we be nomore a reproach. 

{2:18} Then I told them of the hand of my God whichwas good upon me; as also the king's words that he had spoken unto me.And they said, Let us rise up and build. So they strengthened theirhands for [this] good [work. ]

{2:19} But when Sanballat the Horonite,and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite, and Geshem the Arabian, heard[it,] they laughed us to scorn, and despised us, and said, What [is]this thing that ye do? will ye rebel against the king? 

{2:20} Thenanswered I them, and said unto them, The God of heaven, he will prosperus; therefore we his servants will arise and build: but ye have noportion, nor right, nor memorial, in Jerusalem.   

{3:1} Then Eliashib the high priest rose up with his brethren thepriests, and they builded the sheep gate; they sanctified it, and setup the doors of it; even unto the tower of Meah they sanctified it,unto the tower of Hananeel. 

{3:2} And next unto him builded the men ofJericho. And next to them builded Zaccur the son of Imri. 

{3:3} But thefish gate did the sons of Hassenaah build, who [also] laid the beamsthereof, and set up the doors thereof, the locks thereof, and the barsthereof. 

{3:4} And next unto them repaired Meremoth the son of Urijah,the son of Koz. And next unto them repaired Meshullam the son ofBerechiah, the son of Meshezabeel. And next unto them repaired Zadokthe son of Baana. 

{3:5} And next unto them the Tekoites repaired; buttheir nobles put not their necks to the work of their Lord. 

{3:6}Moreover the old gate repaired Jehoiada the son of Paseah, andMeshullam the son of Besodeiah; they laid the beams thereof, and set upthe doors thereof, and the locks thereof, and the bars thereof. 

{3:7}And next unto them repaired Melatiah the Gibeonite, and Jadon theMeronothite, the men of Gibeon, and of Mizpah, unto the throne of thegovernor on this side the river. 

{3:8} Next unto him repaired Uzzielthe son of Harhaiah, of the goldsmiths. Next unto him also repairedHananiah the son of [one of] the apothecaries, and they fortifiedJerusalem unto the broad wall. 

{3:9} And next unto them repairedRephaiah the son of Hur, the ruler of the half part of Jerusalem.

{3:10} And next unto them repaired Jedaiah the son of Harumaph, evenover against his house. And next unto him repaired Hattush the son ofHashabniah.

{3:12} And next unto him repaired Shallum the son of Halohesh, theruler of the half part of Jerusalem, he and his daughters. 

{3:13} Thevalley gate repaired Hanun, and the inhabitants of Zanoah; they builtit, and set up the doors thereof, the locks thereof, and the barsthereof, and a thousand cubits on the wall unto the dung gate. 

{3:14}But the dung gate repaired Malchiah the son of Rechab, the ruler ofpart of Beth-haccerem; he build it, and set up the doors thereof, thelocks thereof, and the bars thereof. 

{3:15} But the gate of thefountain repaired Shallun the son of Col-hozeh, the ruler of part ofMizpah; he built it, and covered it, and set up the doors thereof, thelocks thereof, and the bars thereof, and the wall of the pool of Siloahby the king's garden, and unto the stairs that go down from the city ofDavid. 

{3:16} After him repaired Nehemiah the son of Azbuk, the rulerof the half part of Beth-zur, unto [the place] over against thesepulchres of David, and to the pool that was made, and unto the houseof the mighty. 

{3:17} After him repaired the Levites, Rehum the son ofBani. Next unto him repaired Hashabiah, the ruler of the half part ofKeilah, in his part. 

{3:18} After him repaired their brethren, Bavaithe son of Henadad, the ruler of the half part of Keilah. 

{3:19} Andnext to him repaired Ezer the son of Jeshua, the ruler of Mizpah,another piece over against the going up to the armoury at the turning[of the wall. ]

{3:20} After him Baruch the son of Zabbai earnestlyrepaired the other piece, from the turning [of the wall] unto the doorof the house of Eliashib the high priest. 

{3:21} After him repairedMeremoth the son of Urijah the son of Koz another piece, from the doorof the house of Eliashib even to the end of the house of Eliashib.

{3:22} And after him repaired the priests, the men of the plain. 

{3:23}After him repaired Benjamin and Hashub over against their house. Afterhim repaired Azariah the son of Maaseiah the son of Ananiah by hishouse. 

{3:24} After him repaired Binnui the son of Henadad anotherpiece, from the house of Azariah unto the turning [of the wall,] evenunto the corner. 

{3:25} Palal the son of Uzai, over against the turning[of the wall,] and the tower which lieth out from the king's highhouse, that [was] by the court of the prison. After him Pedaiah the sonof Parosh. 

{3:26} Moreover the Nethinims dwelt in Ophel, unto [theplace] over against the water gate toward the east, and the tower thatlieth out. 

{3:27} After them the Tekoites repaired another piece, overagainst the great tower that lieth out, even unto the wall of Ophel.

{3:28} From above the horse gate repaired the priests, every one overagainst his house. 

{3:29} After them repaired Zadok the son of Immerover against his house. After him repaired also Shemaiah the son ofShechaniah, the keeper of the east gate. 

{3:30} After him repairedHananiah the son of Shelemiah, and Hanun the sixth son of Zalaph,another piece. After him repaired Meshullam the son of Berechiah overagainst his chamber. 

{3:31} After him repaired Malchiah the goldsmith'sson unto the place of the Nethinims, and of the merchants, over againstthe gate Miphkad, and to the going up of the corner. 

{3:32} And betweenthe going up of the corner unto the sheep gate repaired the goldsmithsand the merchants.   

{4:1} But it came to pass, that when Sanballat heard that we buildedthe wall, he was wroth, and took great indignation, and mocked theJews. 

{4:2} And he spake before his brethren and the army of Samaria,and said, What do these feeble Jews? will they fortify themselves? willthey sacrifice? will they make an end in a day? will they revive thestones out of the heaps of the rubbish which are burned? 

{4:3} NowTobiah the Ammonite [was] by him, and he said, Even that which theybuild, if a fox go up, he shall even break down their stone wall. 

{4:4}Hear, O our God; for we are despised: and turn their reproach upontheir own head, and give them for a prey in the land of captivity:

{4:5} And cover not their iniquity, and let not their sin be blottedout from before thee: for they have provoked [thee] to anger before thebuilders. 

{4:6} So built we the wall; and all the wall was joinedtogether unto the half thereof: for the people had a mind to work.   

{4:7} But it came to pass, [that] when Sanballat, and Tobiah, andthe Arabians, and the Ammonites, and the Ashdodites, heard that thewalls of Jerusalem were made up, [and] that the breaches began to bestopped, then they were very wroth, 

{4:8} And conspired all of themtogether to come [and] to fight against Jerusalem, and to hinder it.

{4:9} Nevertheless we made our prayer unto our God, and set a watchagainst them day and night, because of them. 

{4:10} And Judah said, Thestrength of the bearers of burdens is decayed, and [there is] muchrubbish; so that we are not able to build the wall. 

{4:11} And ouradversaries said, They shall not know, neither see, till we come in themidst among them, and slay them, and cause the work to cease. 

{4:12}And it came to pass, that when the Jews which dwelt by them came, theysaid unto us ten times, From all places whence ye shall return unto us[they will be upon you.]   

{4:13} Therefore set I in the lower places behind the wall, [and] onthe higher places, I even set the people after their families withtheir swords, their spears, and their bows. 

{4:14} And I looked, androse up, and said unto the nobles, and to the rulers, and to the restof the people, Be not ye afraid of them: remember the Lord, [which is]great and terrible, and fight for your brethren, your sons, and yourdaughters, your wives, and your houses. 

{4:15} And it came to pass,when our enemies heard that it was known unto us, and God had broughttheir counsel to nought, that we returned all of us to the wall, everyone unto his work. 

{4:16} And it came to pass from that time forth,[that] the half of my servants wrought in the work, and the other halfof them held both the spears, the shields, and the bows, and thehabergeons; and the rulers [were] behind all the house of Judah. 

{4:17}They which builded on the wall, and they that bare burdens, with thosethat laded, [every one] with one of his hands wrought in the work, andwith the other [hand] held a weapon. 

{4:18} For the builders, every onehad his sword girded by his side, and [so] builded. And he that soundedthe trumpet [was] by me.   

{4:19} And I said unto the nobles, and to the rulers, and to therest of the people, The work [is] great and large, and we are separatedupon the wall, one far from another. 

{4:20} In what place [therefore]ye hear the sound of the trumpet, resort ye thither unto us: our Godshall fight for us. 

{4:21} So we laboured in the work: and half of themheld the spears from the rising of the morning till the stars appeared.

{4:22} Likewise at the same time said I unto the people, Let every onewith his servant lodge within Jerusalem, that in the night they may bea guard to us, and labour on the day. 

{4:23} So neither I, nor mybrethren, nor my servants, nor the men of the guard which followed me,none of us put off our clothes, [saving that] every one put them offfor washing.   

{5:1} And there was a great cry of the people and of their wivesagainst their brethren the Jews. 

{5:2} For there were that said, We,our sons, and our daughters, [are] many: therefore we take up corn [forthem,] that we may eat, and live. 

{5:3} [Some] also there were thatsaid, We have mortgaged our lands, vineyards, and houses, that we mightbuy corn, because of the dearth. 

{5:4} There were also that said, Wehave borrowed money for the king's tribute, [and that upon] our landsand vineyards. 

{5:5} Yet now our flesh [is] as the flesh of ourbrethren, our children as their children: and, lo, we bring intobondage our sons and our daughters to be servants, and [some] of ourdaughters are brought unto bondage [already:] neither [is it] in ourpower [to redeem them;] for other men have our lands and vineyards.   

{5:6} And I was very angry when I heard their cry and these words.

{5:7} Then I consulted with myself, and I rebuked the nobles, and therulers, and said unto them, Ye exact usury, every one of his brother.And I set a great assembly against them. 

{5:8} And I said unto them, Weafter our ability have redeemed our brethren the Jews, which were soldunto the heathen; and will ye even sell your brethren? or shall they besold unto us? Then held they their peace, and found nothing [to answer.]

{5:9} Also I said, It [is] not good that ye do: ought ye not to walkin the fear of our God because of the reproach of the heathen ourenemies? 

{5:10} I likewise, [and] my brethren, and my servants, mightexact of them money and corn: I pray you, let us leave off this usury.

{5:11} Restore, I pray you, to them, even this day, their lands, theirvineyards, their oliveyards, and their houses, also the the hundredth[part] of the money, and of the corn, the wine, and the oil, that yeexact of them. 

{5:12} Then said they, We will restore [them,] and willrequire nothing of them; so will we do as thou sayest. Then I calledthe priests, and took an oath of them, that they should do according tothis promise. 

{5:13} Also I shook my lap, and said, So God shake outevery man from his house, and from his labour, that performeth not thispromise, even thus be he shaken out, and emptied. And all thecongregation said, Amen, and praised the LORD. And the people didaccording to this promise.   

{5:14} Moreover from the time that I was appointed to be theirgovernor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year even unto thetwo and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes the king, [that is,] twelve years,I and my brethren have not eaten the bread of the governor. 

{5:15} Butthe former governors that [had been] before me were chargeable unto thepeople, and had taken of them bread and wine, beside forty shekels ofsilver; yea, even their servants bare rule over the people: but so didnot I, because of the fear of God. 

{5:16} Yea, also I continued in thework of this wall, neither bought we any land: and all my servants[were] gathered thither unto the work. 

{5:17} Moreover [there were] atmy table an hundred and fifty of the Jews and rulers, beside those thatcame unto us from among the heathen that [are] about us. 

{5:18} Now[that] which was prepared [for me] daily [was] one ox [and] six choicesheep; also fowls were prepared for me, and once in ten days store ofall sorts of wine: yet for all this required not I the bread of thegovernor, because the bondage was heavy upon this people. 

{5:19} Thinkupon me, my God, for good, [according] to all that I have done for thispeople.   

{6:1} Now it came to pass, when Sanballat, and Tobiah, and Geshemthe Arabian, and the rest of our enemies, heard that I had builded thewall, and [that] there was no breach left therein; (though at that timeI had not set up the doors upon the gates;) 

{6:2} That Sanballat andGeshem sent unto me, saying, Come, let us meet together in [some oneof] the villages in the plain of Ono. But they thought to do memischief. 

{6:3} And I sent messengers unto them, saying, I [am] doing agreat work, so that I cannot come down: why should the work cease,whilst I leave it, and come down to you? 

{6:4} Yet they sent unto mefour times after this sort; and I answered them after the same manner.

{6:5} Then sent Sanballat his servant unto me in like manner the fifthtime with an open letter in his hand; 

{6:6} Wherein [was] written, Itis reported among the heathen, and Gashmu saith [it, that] thou and theJews think to rebel: for which cause thou buildest the wall, that thoumayest be their king, according to these words. 

{6:7} And thou hastalso appointed prophets to preach of thee at Jerusalem, saying, [Thereis] a king in Judah: and now shall it be reported to the king accordingto these words. Come now therefore, and let us take counsel together.

{6:8} Then I sent unto him, saying, There are no such things done asthou sayest, but thou feignest them out of thine own heart. 

{6:9} Forthey all made us afraid, saying, Their hands shall be weakened from thework, that it be not done. Now therefore, [O God,] strengthen my hands.

{6:10} Afterward I came unto the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiahthe son of Mehetabeel, who [was] shut up; and he said, Let us meettogether in the house of God, within the temple, and let us shut thedoors of the temple: for they will come to slay thee; yea, in the nightwill they come to slay thee. 

{6:11} And I said, Should such a man as Iflee? and who [is there,] that, [being] as I [am,] would go into thetemple to save his life? I will not go in. 

{6:12} And, lo, I perceivedthat God had not sent him; but that he pronounced this prophecy againstme: for Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him. 

{6:13} Therefore [was] hehired, that I should be afraid, and do so, and sin, and [that] theymight have [matter] for an evil report, that they might reproach me.

{6:14} My God, think thou upon Tobiah and Sanballat according to thesetheir works, and on the prophetess Noadiah, and the rest of theprophets, that would have put me in fear.   

{6:15} So the wall was finished in the twenty and fifth [day] of[the month] Elul, in fifty and two days. 

{6:16} And it came to pass,that when all our enemies heard [thereof,] and all the heathen that[were] about us saw [these things,] they were much cast down in theirown eyes: for they perceived that this work was wrought of our God.   

{6:17} Moreover in those days the nobles of Judah sent many lettersunto Tobiah, and [the letters] of Tobiah came unto them. 

{6:18} For[there were] many in Judah sworn unto him, because he [was] the son inlaw of Shechaniah the son of Arah; and his son Johanan had taken thedaughter of Meshullam the son of Berechiah. 

{6:19} Also they reportedhis good deeds before me, and uttered my words to him. [And] Tobiahsent letters to put me in fear.   

{7:1} Now it came to pass, when the wall was built, and I had set upthe doors, and the porters and the singers and the Levites wereappointed, 

{7:2} That I gave my brother Hanani, and Hananiah the rulerof the palace, charge over Jerusalem: for he [was] a faithful man, andfeared God above many. 

{7:3} And I said unto them, Let not the gates ofJerusalem be opened until the sun be hot; and while they stand by, letthem shut the doors, and bar [them:] and appoint watches of theinhabitants of Jerusalem, every one in his watch, and every one [to be]over against his house. 

{7:4} Now the city [was] large and great: butthe people [were] few therein, and the houses [were] not builded.   

{7:5} And my God put into mine heart to gather together the nobles,and the rulers, and the people, that they might be reckoned bygenealogy. And I found a register of the genealogy of them which cameup at the first, and found written therein, 

{7:6} These [are] thechildren of the province, that went up out of the captivity, of thosethat had been carried away, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon hadcarried away, and came again to Jerusalem and to Judah, every one untohis city;

{7:63} And of the priests: the children of Habaiah, the children ofKoz, the children of Barzillai, which took [one] of the daughters ofBarzillai the Gileadite to wife, and was called after their name.

{7:64} These sought their register [among] those that were reckoned bygenealogy, but it was not found: therefore were they, as polluted, putfrom the priesthood. 

{7:65} And the Tirshatha said unto them, that theyshould not eat of the most holy things, till there stood [up] a priestwith Urim and Thummim.   

{7:66} The whole congregation together [was] forty and two thousandthree hundred and threescore, 

{7:67} Beside their manservants and theirmaidservants, of whom [there were] seven thousand three hundred thirtyand seven: and they had two hundred forty and five singing men andsinging women. 

{7:68} Their horses, seven hundred thirty and six: theirmules, two hundred forty and five: 

{7:69} [Their] camels, four hundredthirty and five: six thousand seven hundred and twenty asses.   

{7:70} And some of the chief of the fathers gave unto the work. TheTirshatha gave to the treasure a thousand drams of gold, fifty basons,five hundred and thirty priests' garments. 

{7:71} And [some] of thechief of the fathers gave to the treasure of the work twenty thousanddrams of gold, and two thousand and two hundred pounds of silver.

{7:72} And [that] which the rest of the people gave [was] twentythousand drams of gold, and two thousand pounds of silver, andthreescore and seven priests' garments. 

{7:73} So the priests, and theLevites, and the porters, and the singers, and [some] of the people,and the Nethinims, and all Israel, dwelt in their cities; and when theseventh month came, the children of Israel [were] in their cities.   

{8:1} And all the people gathered themselves together as one maninto the street that [was] before the water gate; and they spake untoEzra the scribe to bring the book of the law of Moses, which the LORDhad commanded to Israel. 

{8:2} And Ezra the priest brought the lawbefore the congregation both of men and women, and all that could hearwith understanding, upon the first day of the seventh month. 

{8:3} Andhe read therein before the street that [was] before the water gate fromthe morning until midday, before the men and the women, and those thatcould understand; and the ears of all the people [were attentive] untothe book of the law. 

{8:4} And Ezra the scribe stood upon a pulpit ofwood, which they had made for the purpose; and beside him stoodMattithiah, and Shema, and Anaiah, and Urijah, and Hilkiah, andMaaseiah, on his right hand; and on his left hand, Pedaiah, andMishael, and Malchiah, and Hashum, and Hashbadana, Zechariah, [and]Meshullam. 

{8:5} And Ezra opened the book in the sight of all thepeople; (for he was above all the people;) and when he opened it, allthe people stood up: 

{8:6} And Ezra blessed the LORD, the great God.And all the people answered, Amen, Amen, with lifting up their hands:and they bowed their heads, and worshipped the LORD with [their] facesto the ground. 

{8:7} Also Jeshua, and Bani, and Sherebiah, Jamin,Akkub, Shabbethai, Hodijah, Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad, Hanan,Pelaiah, and the Levites, caused the people to understand the law: andthe people [stood] in their place. 

{8:8} So they read in the book inthe law of God distinctly, and gave the sense, and caused [them] tounderstand the reading.   

{8:9} And Nehemiah, which [is] the Tirshatha, and Ezra the priestthe scribe, and the Levites that taught the people, said unto all thepeople, This day [is] holy unto the LORD your God; mourn not, nor weep.For all the people wept, when they heard the words of the law. 

{8:10}Then he said unto them, Go your way, eat the fat, and drink the sweet,and send portions unto them for whom nothing is prepared: for [this]day [is] holy unto our Lord: neither be ye sorry; for the joy of theLORD is your strength. 

{8:11} So the Levites stilled all the people,saying, Hold your peace, for the day [is] holy; neither be ye grieved.

{8:12} And all the people went their way to eat, and to drink, and tosend portions, and to make great mirth, because they had understood thewords that were declared unto them.   

{8:13} And on the second day were gathered together the chief of thefathers of all the people, the priests, and the Levites, unto Ezra thescribe, even to understand the words of the law. 

{8:14} And they foundwritten in the law which the LORD had commanded by Moses, that thechildren of Israel should dwell in booths in the feast of the seventhmonth: 

{8:15} And that they should publish and proclaim in all theircities, and in Jerusalem, saying, Go forth unto the mount, and fetcholive branches, and pine branches, and myrtle branches, and palmbranches, and branches of thick trees, to make booths, as [it is]written.   

{8:16} So the people went forth, and brought [them,] and madethemselves booths, every one upon the roof of his house, and in theircourts, and in the courts of the house of God, and in the street of thewater gate, and in the street of the gate of Ephraim. 

{8:17} And allthe congregation of them that were come again out of the captivity madebooths, and sat under the booths: for since the days of Jeshua the sonof Nun unto that day had not the children of Israel done so. And therewas very great gladness. 

{8:18} Also day by day, from the first dayunto the last day, he read in the book of the law of God. And they keptthe feast seven days; and on the eighth day [was] a solemn assembly,according unto the manner.   

{9:1} Now in the twenty and fourth day of this month the children ofIsrael were assembled with fasting, and with sackclothes, and earthupon them. 

{9:2} And the seed of Israel separated themselves from allstrangers, and stood and confessed their sins, and the iniquities oftheir fathers. 

{9:3} And they stood up in their place, and read in thebook of the law of the LORD their God [one] fourth part of the day; and[another] fourth part they confessed, and worshipped the LORD their God.   

{9:4} Then stood up upon the stairs, of the Levites, Jeshua, andBani, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani, [and] Chenani, andcried with a loud voice unto the LORD their God. 

{9:5} Then theLevites, Jeshua, and Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabniah, Sherebiah, Hodijah,Shebaniah, [and] Pethahiah, said, Stand up [and] bless the LORD yourGod for ever and ever: and blessed be thy glorious name, which isexalted above all blessing and praise. 

{9:6} Thou, [even] thou, [art]LORD alone; thou hast made heaven, the heaven of heavens, with alltheir host, the earth, and all [things] that [are] therein, the seas,and all that [is] therein, and thou preservest them all; and the hostof heaven worshippeth thee. 

{9:7} Thou [art] the LORD the God, whodidst choose Abram, and broughtest him forth out of Ur of the Chaldees,and gavest him the name of Abraham; 

{9:8} And foundest his heartfaithful before thee, and madest a covenant with him to give the landof the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, and the Perizzites, andthe Jebusites, and the Girgashites, to give [it, I say,] to his seed,and hast performed thy words; for thou [art] righteous: 

{9:9} And didstsee the affliction of our fathers in Egypt, and heardest their cry bythe Red sea; 

{9:10} And shewedst signs and wonders upon Pharaoh, and onall his servants, and on all the people of his land: for thou knewestthat they dealt proudly against them. So didst thou get thee a name, as[it is] this day. 

{9:11} And thou didst divide the sea before them, sothat they went through the midst of the sea on the dry land; and theirpersecutors thou threwest into the deeps, as a stone into the mightywaters. 

{9:12} Moreover thou leddest them in the day by a cloudypillar; and in the night by a pillar of fire, to give them light in theway wherein they should go. 

{9:13} Thou camest down also upon mountSinai, and spakest with them from heaven, and gavest them rightjudgments, and true laws, good statutes and commandments: 

{9:14} Andmadest known unto them thy holy sabbath, and commandedst them precepts,statutes, and laws, by the hand of Moses thy servant: 

{9:15} And gavestthem bread from heaven for their hunger, and broughtest forth water forthem out of the rock for their thirst, and promisedst them that theyshould go in to possess the land which thou hadst sworn to give them.

{9:16} But they and our fathers dealt proudly, and hardened theirnecks, and hearkened not to thy commandments, 

{9:17} And refused toobey, neither were mindful of thy wonders that thou didst among them;but hardened their necks, and in their rebellion appointed a captain toreturn to their bondage: but thou [art] a God ready to pardon, graciousand merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and forsookest themnot. 

{9:18} Yea, when they had made them a molten calf, and said, This[is] thy God that brought thee up out of Egypt, and had wrought greatprovocations; 

{9:19} Yet thou in thy manifold mercies forsookest themnot in the wilderness: the pillar of the cloud departed not from themby day, to lead them in the way; neither the pillar of fire by night,to shew them light, and the way wherein they should go. 

{9:20} Thougavest also thy good spirit to instruct them, and withheldest not thymanna from their mouth, and gavest them water for their thirst. 

{9:21}Yea, forty years didst thou sustain them in the wilderness, [so that]they lacked nothing; their clothes waxed not old, and their feetswelled not. 

{9:22} Moreover thou gavest them kingdoms and nations, anddidst divide them into corners: so they possessed the land of Sihon,and the land of the king of Heshbon, and the land of Og king of Bashan.

{9:23} Their children also multipliedst thou as the stars of heaven,and broughtest them into the land, concerning which thou hadst promisedto their fathers, that they should go in to possess [it. ]

{9:24} So thechildren went in and possessed the land, and thou subduedst before themthe inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, and gavest them into theirhands, with their kings, and the people of the land, that they might dowith them as they would. 

{9:25} And they took strong cities, and a fatland, and possessed houses full of all goods, wells digged, vineyards,and oliveyards, and fruit trees in abundance: so they did eat, and werefilled, and became fat, and delighted themselves in thy great goodness.

{9:26} Nevertheless they were disobedient, and rebelled against thee,and cast thy law behind their backs, and slew thy prophets whichtestified against them to turn them to thee, and they wrought greatprovocations. 

{9:27} Therefore thou deliveredst them into the hand oftheir enemies, who vexed them: and in the time of their trouble, whenthey cried unto thee, thou heardest [them] from heaven; and accordingto thy manifold mercies thou gavest them saviours, who saved them outof the hand of their enemies. 

{9:28} But after they had rest, they didevil again before thee: therefore leftest thou them in the hand oftheir enemies, so that they had the dominion over them: yet when theyreturned, and cried unto thee, thou heardest [them] from heaven; andmany times didst thou deliver them according to thy mercies; 

{9:29} Andtestifiedst against them, that thou mightest bring them again unto thylaw: yet they dealt proudly, and hearkened not unto thy commandments,but sinned against thy judgments, (which if a man do, he shall live inthem;) and withdrew the shoulder, and hardened their neck, and wouldnot hear. 

{9:30} Yet many years didst thou forbear them, andtestifiedst against them by thy spirit in thy prophets: yet would theynot give ear: therefore gavest thou them into the hand of the people ofthe lands. 

{9:31} Nevertheless for thy great mercies' sake thou didstnot utterly consume them, nor forsake them; for thou [art] a graciousand merciful God. 

{9:32} Now therefore, our God, the great, the mighty,and the terrible God, who keepest covenant and mercy, let not all thetrouble seem little before thee, that hath come upon us, on our kings,on our princes, and on our priests, and on our prophets, and on ourfathers, and on all thy people, since the time of the kings of Assyriaunto this day. 

{9:33} Howbeit thou [art] just in all that is broughtupon us; for thou hast done right, but we have done wickedly: 

{9:34}Neither have our kings, our princes, our priests, nor our fathers, keptthy law, nor hearkened unto thy commandments and thy testimonies,wherewith thou didst testify against them. 

{9:35} For they have notserved thee in their kingdom, and in thy great goodness that thougavest them, and in the large and fat land which thou gavest beforethem, neither turned they from their wicked works. 

{9:36} Behold, we[are] servants this day, and [for] the land that thou gavest unto ourfathers to eat the fruit thereof and the good thereof, behold, we [are]servants in it: 

{9:37} And it yieldeth much increase unto the kingswhom thou hast set over us because of our sins: also they have dominionover our bodies, and over our cattle, at their pleasure, and we [are]in great distress. 

{9:38} And because of all this we make a sure[covenant,] and write [it;] and our princes, Levites, [and] priests,seal [unto it.]   

{10:1} Now those that sealed [were,] Nehemiah, the Tirshatha, theson of Hachaliah, and Zidkijah,

{10:29} They clave to their brethren, theirnobles, and entered into a curse, and into an oath, to walk in God'slaw, which was given by Moses the servant of God, and to observe and doall the commandments of the LORD our Lord, and his judgments and hisstatutes; 

{10:30} And that we would not give our daughters unto thepeople of the land, nor take their daughters for our sons: 

{10:31} And[if] the people of the land bring ware or any victuals on the sabbathday to sell, [that] we would not buy it of them on the sabbath, or onthe holy day: and [that] we would leave the seventh year, and theexaction of every debt. 

{10:32} Also we made ordinances for us, tocharge ourselves yearly with the third part of a shekel for the serviceof the house of our God; 

{10:33} For the shewbread, and for thecontinual meat offering, and for the continual burnt offering, of thesabbaths, of the new moons, for the set feasts, and for the holy[things,] and for the sin offerings to make an atonement for Israel,and [for] all the work of the house of our God. 

{10:34} And we cast thelots among the priests, the Levites, and the people, for the woodoffering, to bring [it] into the house of our God, after the houses ofour fathers, at times appointed year by year, to burn upon the altar ofthe LORD our God, as [it is] written in the law:

{10:38} And the priest theson of Aaron shall be with the Levites, when the Levites take tithes:and the Levites shall bring up the tithe of the tithes unto the houseof our God, to the chambers, into the treasure house. 

{10:39} For thechildren of Israel and the children of Levi shall bring the offering ofthe corn, of the new wine, and the oil, unto the chambers, where [are]the vessels of the sanctuary, and the priests that minister, and theporters, and the singers: and we will not forsake the house of our God.

{12:40} So stood the two[companies of them that gave] thanks in the house of God, and I, andthe half of the rulers with me: 

{12:41} And the priests; Eliakim,Maaseiah, Miniamin, Michaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah, [and] Hananiah, withtrumpets; 

{12:42} And Maaseiah, and Shemaiah, and Eleazar, and Uzzi,and Jehohanan, and Malchijah, and Elam, and Ezer. And the singers sangloud, with Jezrahiah [their] overseer. 

{12:43} Also that day theyoffered great sacrifices, and rejoiced: for God had made them rejoicewith great joy: the wives also and the children rejoiced: so that thejoy of Jerusalem was heard even afar off.   

{12:44} And at that time were some appointed over the chambers forthe treasures, for the offerings, for the firstfruits, and for thetithes, to gather into them out of the fields of the cities theportions of the law for the priests and Levites: for Judah rejoiced forthe priests and for the Levites that waited. 

{12:45} And both thesingers and the porters kept the ward of their God, and the ward of thepurification, according to the commandment of David, [and] of Solomonhis son. 

{12:46} For in the days of David and Asaph of old [there were]chief of the singers, and songs of praise and thanksgiving unto God.

{12:47} And all Israel in the days of Zerubbabel, and in the days ofNehemiah, gave the portions of the singers and the porters, every dayhis portion: and they sanctified [holy things] unto the Levites; andthe Levites sanctified [them] unto the children of Aaron.   

{13:1} On that day they read in the book of Moses in the audience ofthe people; and therein was found written, that the Ammonite and theMoabite should not come into the congregation of God for ever; 

{13:2}Because they met not the children of Israel with bread and with water,but hired Balaam against them, that he should curse them: howbeit ourGod turned the curse into a blessing. 

{13:3} Now it came to pass, whenthey had heard the law, that they separated from Israel all the mixedmultitude.   

{13:4} And before this, Eliashib the priest, having the oversight ofthe chamber of the house of our God, [was] allied unto Tobiah: 

{13:5}And he had prepared for him a great chamber, where aforetime they laidthe meat offerings, the frankincense, and the vessels, and the tithesof the corn, the new wine, and the oil, which was commanded [to begiven] to the Levites, and the singers, and the porters; and theofferings of the priests. 

{13:6} But in all this [time] was not I atJerusalem: for in the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes king ofBabylon came I unto the king, and after certain days obtained I leaveof the king: 

{13:7} And I came to Jerusalem, and understood of the evilthat Eliashib did for Tobiah, in preparing him a chamber in the courtsof the house of God. 

{13:8} And it grieved me sore: therefore I castforth all the household stuff of Tobiah out of the chamber. 

{13:9} ThenI commanded, and they cleansed the chambers: and thither brought Iagain the vessels of the house of God, with the meat offering and thefrankincense.   

{13:10} And I perceived that the portions of the Levites had notbeen given [them:] for the Levites and the singers, that did the work,were fled every one to his field. 

{13:11} Then contended I with therulers, and said, Why is the house of God forsaken? And I gathered themtogether, and set them in their place. 

{13:12} Then brought all Judahthe tithe of the corn and the new wine and the oil unto the treasuries.

{13:13} And I made treasurers over the treasuries, Shelemiah thepriest, and Zadok the scribe, and of the Levites, Pedaiah: and next tothem [was] Hanan the son of Zaccur, the son of Mattaniah: for they werecounted faithful, and their office [was] to distribute unto theirbrethren. 

{13:14} Remember me, O my God, concerning this, and wipe notout my good deeds that I have done for the house of my God, and for theoffices thereof.   

{13:15} In those days saw I in Judah [some] treading winepresses onthe sabbath, and bringing in sheaves, and lading asses; as also wine,grapes, and figs, and all [manner of] burdens, which they brought intoJerusalem on the sabbath day: and I testified [against them] in the daywherein they sold victuals. 

{13:16} There dwelt men of Tyre alsotherein, which brought fish, and all manner of ware, and sold on thesabbath unto the children of Judah, and in Jerusalem. 

{13:17} Then Icontended with the nobles of Judah, and said unto them, What evil thing[is] this that ye do, and profane the sabbath day? 

{13:18} Did not yourfathers thus, and did not our God bring all this evil upon us, and uponthis city? yet ye bring more wrath upon Israel by profaning thesabbath. 

{13:19} And it came to pass, that when the gates of Jerusalembegan to be dark before the sabbath, I commanded that the gates shouldbe shut, and charged that they should not be opened till after thesabbath: and [some] of my servants set I at the gates, [that] thereshould no burden be brought in on the sabbath day. 

{13:20} So themerchants and sellers of all kind of ware lodged without Jerusalem onceor twice. 

{13:21} Then I testified against them, and said unto them,Why lodge ye about the wall? if ye do so again, I will lay hands onyou. From that time forth came they no [more] on the sabbath. 

{13:22}And I commanded the Levites that they should cleanse themselves, and[that] they should come [and] keep the gates, to sanctify the sabbathday. Remember me, O my God, [concerning] this also, and spare meaccording to the greatness of thy mercy.   

{13:23} In those days also saw I Jews [that] had married wives ofAshdod, of Ammon, [and] of Moab: 

{13:24} And their children spake halfin the speech of Ashdod, and could not speak in the Jews' language, butaccording to the language of each people. 

{13:25} And I contended withthem, and cursed them, and smote certain of them, and plucked off theirhair, and made them swear by God, [saying,] Ye shall not give yourdaughters unto their sons, nor take their daughters unto your sons, orfor yourselves. 

{13:26} Did not Solomon king of Israel sin by thesethings? yet among many nations was there no king like him, who wasbeloved of his God, and God made him king over all Israel: neverthelesseven him did outlandish women cause to sin. 

{13:27} Shall we thenhearken unto you to do all this great evil, to transgress against ourGod in marrying strange wives? 

{13:28} And [one] of the sons of Joiada,the son of Eliashib the high priest, [was] son in law to Sanballat theHoronite: therefore I chased him from me. 

{13:29} Remember them, O myGod, because they have defiled the priesthood, and the covenant of thepriesthood, and of the Levites. 

{13:30} Thus cleansed I them from allstrangers, and appointed the wards of the priests and the Levites,every one in his business; 

{13:31} And for the wood offering, at timesappointed, and for the firstfruits. Remember me, O my God, for good.
