{The Second Book of Moses, called Exodus   

{1:1} Now these [are] the names of the children of Israel, whichcame into Egypt; every man and his household came with Jacob. 

{1:2}Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah, 

{1:3} Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin,

{1:4} Dan, and Naphtali, Gad, and Asher. 

{1:5} And all the souls thatcame out of the loins of Jacob were seventy souls: for Joseph was inEgypt [already. ]

{1:6} And Joseph died, and all his brethren, and allthat generation.   

{1:7} And the children of Israel were fruitful, and increasedabundantly, and multiplied, and waxed exceeding mighty; and the landwas filled with them. 

{1:8} Now there arose up a new king over Egypt,which knew not Joseph. 

{1:9} And he said unto his people, Behold, thepeople of the children of Israel [are] more and mightier than we:

{1:10} Come on, let us deal wisely with them; lest they multiply, andit come to pass, that, when there falleth out any war, they join alsounto our enemies, and fight against us, and [so] get them up out of theland. 

{1:11} Therefore they did set over them taskmasters to afflictthem with their burdens. And they built for Pharaoh treasure cities,Pithom and Raamses. 

{1:12} But the more they afflicted them, the morethey multiplied and grew. And they were grieved because of the childrenof Israel. 

{1:13} And the Egyptians made the children of Israel toserve with rigour: 

{1:14} And they made their lives bitter with hardbondage, in morter, and in brick, and in all manner of service in thefield: all their service, wherein they made them serve, [was] withrigour.   

{1:15} And the king of Egypt spake to the Hebrew midwives, of whichthe name of the one [was] Shiphrah, and the name of the other Puah:

{1:16} And he said, When ye do the office of a midwife to the Hebrewwomen, and see [them] upon the stools; if it [be] a son, then ye shallkill him: but if it [be] a daughter, then she shall live. 

{1:17} Butthe midwives feared God, and did not as the king of Egypt commandedthem, but saved the men children alive. 

{1:18} And the king of Egyptcalled for the midwives, and said unto them, Why have ye done thisthing, and have saved the men children alive? 

{1:19} And the midwivessaid unto Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew women [are] not as the Egyptianwomen; for they [are] lively, and are delivered ere the midwives comein unto them. 

{1:20} Therefore God dealt well with the midwives: andthe people multiplied, and waxed very mighty. 

{1:21} And it came topass, because the midwives feared God, that he made them houses. 

{1:22}And Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, Every son that is born yeshall cast into the river, and every daughter ye shall save alive.   

{2:1} And there went a man of the house of Levi, and took [to wife]a daughter of Levi. 

{2:2} And the woman conceived, and bare a son: andwhen she saw him that he [was a] goodly [child,] she hid him threemonths. 

{2:3} And when she could not longer hide him, she took for himan ark of bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with pitch, and putthe child therein; and she laid [it] in the flags by the river's brink.

{2:4} And his sister stood afar off, to wit what would be done to him.   

{2:5} And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to wash [herself] at theriver; and her maidens walked along by the river's side; and when shesaw the ark among the flags, she sent her maid to fetch it. 

{2:6} Andwhen she had opened [it,] she saw the child: and, behold, the babewept. And she had compassion on him, and said, This [is one] of theHebrews' children. 

{2:7} Then said his sister to Pharaoh's daughter,Shall I go and call to thee a nurse of the Hebrew women, that she maynurse the child for thee? 

{2:8} And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Go.And the maid went and called the child's mother. 

{2:9} And Pharaoh'sdaughter said unto her, Take this child away, and nurse it for me, andI will give [thee] thy wages. And the woman took the child, and nursedit. 

{2:10} And the child grew, and she brought him unto Pharaoh'sdaughter, and he became her son. And she called his name Moses: and shesaid, Because I drew him out of the water.   

{2:11} And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown, thathe went out unto his brethren, and looked on their burdens: and hespied an Egyptian smiting an Hebrew, one of his brethren. 

{2:12} And helooked this way and that way, and when he saw that [there was] no man,he slew the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand. 

{2:13} And when he wentout the second day, behold, two men of the Hebrews strove together: andhe said to him that did the wrong, Wherefore smitest thou thy fellow?

{2:14} And he said, Who made thee a prince and a judge over us?intendest thou to kill me, as thou killedst the Egyptian? And Mosesfeared, and said, Surely this thing is known. 

{2:15} Now when Pharaohheard this thing, he sought to slay Moses. But Moses fled from the faceof Pharaoh, and dwelt in the land of Midian: and he sat down by a well.

{2:16} Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters: and they came anddrew [water,] and filled the troughs to water their father's flock.

{2:17} And the shepherds came and drove them away: but Moses stood upand helped them, and watered their flock. 

{2:18} And when they came toReuel their father, he said, How [is it that] ye are come so soon today? 

{2:19} And they said, An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand ofthe shepherds, and also drew [water] enough for us, and watered theflock. 

{2:20} And he said unto his daughters, And where [is] he? why[is] it [that] ye have left the man? call him, that he may eat bread.

{2:21} And Moses was content to dwell with the man: and he gave MosesZipporah his daughter. 

{2:22} And she bare [him] a son, and he calledhis name Gershom: for he said, I have been a stranger in a strange land.   

{2:23} And it came to pass in process of time, that the king ofEgypt died: and the children of Israel sighed by reason of the bondage,and they cried, and their cry came up unto God by reason of thebondage. 

{2:24} And God heard their groaning, and God remembered hiscovenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob. 

{2:25} And Godlooked upon the children of Israel, and God had respect unto [them.]   

{3:1} Now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father in law, thepriest of Midian: and he led the flock to the backside of the desert,and came to the mountain of God, [even] to Horeb. 

{3:2} And the angelof the LORD appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of abush: and he looked, and, behold, the bush burned with fire, and thebush [was] not consumed. 

{3:3} And Moses said, I will now turn aside,and see this great sight, why the bush is not burnt. 

{3:4} And when theLORD saw that he turned aside to see, God called unto him out of themidst of the bush, and said, Moses, Moses. And he said, Here [am] I.

{3:5} And he said, Draw not nigh hither: put off thy shoes from off thyfeet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground. 

{3:6}Moreover he said, I [am] the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, theGod of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses hid his face; for he wasafraid to look upon God.   

{3:7} And the LORD said, I have surely seen the affliction of mypeople which [are] in Egypt, and have heard their cry by reason oftheir taskmasters; for I know their sorrows; 

{3:8} And I am come downto deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them upout of that land unto a good land and a large, unto a land flowing withmilk and honey; unto the place of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, andthe Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites.

{3:9} Now therefore, behold, the cry of the children of Israel is comeunto me: and I have also seen the oppression wherewith the Egyptiansoppress them. 

{3:10} Come now therefore, and I will send thee untoPharaoh, that thou mayest bring forth my people the children of Israelout of Egypt.   

{3:11} And Moses said unto God, Who [am] I, that I should go untoPharaoh, and that I should bring forth the children of Israel out ofEgypt? 

{3:12} And he said, Certainly I will be with thee; and this[shall be] a token unto thee, that I have sent thee: When thou hastbrought forth the people out of Egypt, ye shall serve God upon thismountain. 

{3:13} And Moses said unto God, Behold, [when] I come untothe children of Israel, and shall say unto them, The God of yourfathers hath sent me unto you; and they shall say to me, What is hisname? what shall I say unto them? 

{3:14} And God said unto Moses, I AMTHAT I AM: and he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children ofIsrael, I AM hath sent me unto you. 

{3:15} And God said moreover untoMoses, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, The LORD God ofyour fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God ofJacob, hath sent me unto you: this [is] my name for ever, and this [is]my memorial unto all generations. 

{3:16} Go, and gather the elders ofIsrael together, and say unto them, The LORD God of your fathers, theGod of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, appeared unto me, saying, Ihave surely visited you, and [seen] that which is done to you in Egypt:

{3:17} And I have said, I will bring you up out of the affliction ofEgypt unto the land of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and theAmorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, untoa land flowing with milk and honey. 

{3:18} And they shall hearken tothy voice: and thou shalt come, thou and the elders of Israel, unto theking of Egypt, and ye shall say unto him, The LORD God of the Hebrewshath met with us: and now let us go, we beseech thee, three days'journey into the wilderness, that we may sacrifice to the LORD our God.   

{3:19} And I am sure that the king of Egypt will not let you go, no,not by a mighty hand. 

{3:20} And I will stretch out my hand, and smiteEgypt with all my wonders which I will do in the midst thereof: andafter that he will let you go. 

{3:21} And I will give this peoplefavour in the sight of the Egyptians: and it shall come to pass, that,when ye go, ye shall not go empty: 

{3:22} But every woman shall borrowof her neighbour, and of her that sojourneth in her house, jewels ofsilver, and jewels of gold, and raiment: and ye shall put [them] uponyour sons, and upon your daughters; and ye shall spoil the Egyptians.   

{4:1} And Moses answered and said, But, behold, they will notbelieve me, nor hearken unto my voice: for they will say, The LORD hathnot appeared unto thee. 

{4:2} And the LORD said unto him, What [is]that in thine hand? And he said, A rod. 

{4:3} And he said, Cast it onthe ground. And he cast it on the ground, and it became a serpent; andMoses fled from before it. 

{4:4} And the LORD said unto Moses, Putforth thine hand, and take it by the tail. And he put forth his hand,and caught it, and it became a rod in his hand: 

{4:5} That they maybelieve that the LORD God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, the Godof Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath appeared unto thee.   

{4:6} And the LORD said furthermore unto him, Put now thine handinto thy bosom. And he put his hand into his bosom: and when he took itout, behold, his hand [was] leprous as snow. 

{4:7} And he said, Putthine hand into thy bosom again. And he put his hand into his bosomagain; and plucked it out of his bosom, and, behold, it was turnedagain as his [other] flesh. 

{4:8} And it shall come to pass, if theywill not believe thee, neither hearken to the voice of the first sign,that they will believe the voice of the latter sign. 

{4:9} And it shallcome to pass, if they will not believe also these two signs, neitherhearken unto thy voice, that thou shalt take of the water of the river,and pour [it] upon the dry [land:] and the water which thou takest outof the river shall become blood upon the dry [land.]   

{4:10} And Moses said unto the LORD, O my Lord, I [am] not eloquent,neither heretofore, nor since thou hast spoken unto thy servant: but I[am] slow of speech, and of a slow tongue. 

{4:11} And the LORD saidunto him, Who hath made man's mouth? or who maketh the dumb, or deaf,or the seeing, or the blind? have not I the LORD? 

{4:12} Now thereforego, and I will be with thy mouth, and teach thee what thou shalt say.

{4:13} And he said, O my Lord, send, I pray thee, by the hand [of himwhom] thou wilt send. 

{4:14} And the anger of the LORD was kindledagainst Moses, and he said, [Is] not Aaron the Levite thy brother? Iknow that he can speak well. And also, behold, he cometh forth to meetthee: and when he seeth thee, he will be glad in his heart. 

{4:15} Andthou shalt speak unto him, and put words in his mouth: and I will bewith thy mouth, and with his mouth, and will teach you what ye shalldo. 

{4:16} And he shall be thy spokesman unto the people: and he shallbe, [even] he shall be to thee instead of a mouth, and thou shalt be tohim instead of God. 

{4:17} And thou shalt take this rod in thine hand,wherewith thou shalt do signs.   

{4:18} And Moses went and returned to Jethro his father in law, andsaid unto him, Let me go, I pray thee, and return unto my brethrenwhich [are] in Egypt, and see whether they be yet alive. And Jethrosaid to Moses, Go in peace. 

{4:19} And the LORD said unto Moses inMidian, Go, return into Egypt: for all the men are dead which soughtthy life. 

{4:20} And Moses took his wife and his sons, and set themupon an ass, and he returned to the land of Egypt: and Moses took therod of God in his hand. 

{4:21} And the LORD said unto Moses, When thougoest to return into Egypt, see that thou do all those wonders beforePharaoh, which I have put in thine hand: but I will harden his heart,that he shall not let the people go. 

{4:22} And thou shalt say untoPharaoh, Thus saith the LORD, Israel [is] my son, [even] my firstborn:

{4:23} And I say unto thee, Let my son go, that he may serve me: and ifthou refuse to let him go, behold, I will slay thy son, [even] thyfirstborn.   

{4:24} And it came to pass by the way in the inn, that the LORD methim, and sought to kill him. 

{4:25} Then Zipporah took a sharp stone,and cut off the foreskin of her son, and cast [it] at his feet, andsaid, Surely a bloody husband [art] thou to me. 

{4:26} So he let himgo: then she said, A bloody husband [thou art,] because of thecircumcision.   

{4:27} And the LORD said to Aaron, Go into the wilderness to meetMoses. And he went, and met him in the mount of God, and kissed him.

{4:28} And Moses told Aaron all the words of the LORD who had sent him,and all the signs which he had commanded him.   

{4:29} And Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the eldersof the children of Israel: 

{4:30} And Aaron spake all the words whichthe LORD had spoken unto Moses, and did the signs in the sight of thepeople. 

{4:31} And the people believed: and when they heard that theLORD had visited the children of Israel, and that he had looked upontheir affliction, then they bowed their heads and worshipped.   

{5:1} And afterward Moses and Aaron went in, and told Pharaoh, Thussaith the LORD God of Israel, Let my people go, that they may hold afeast unto me in the wilderness. 

{5:2} And Pharaoh said, Who [is] theLORD, that I should obey his voice to let Israel go? I know not theLORD, neither will I let Israel go. 

{5:3} And they said, The God of theHebrews hath met with us: let us go, we pray thee, three days' journeyinto the desert, and sacrifice unto the LORD our God; lest he fall uponus with pestilence, or with the sword. 

{5:4} And the king of Egypt saidunto them, Wherefore do ye, Moses and Aaron, let the people from theirworks? get you unto your burdens. 

{5:5} And Pharaoh said, Behold, thepeople of the land now [are] many, and ye make them rest from theirburdens. 

{5:6} And Pharaoh commanded the same day the taskmasters ofthe people, and their officers, saying, 

{5:7} Ye shall no more give thepeople straw to make brick, as heretofore: let them go and gather strawfor themselves. 

{5:8} And the tale of the bricks, which they did makeheretofore, ye shall lay upon them; ye shall not diminish [ought]thereof: for they [be] idle; therefore they cry, saying, Let us go[and] sacrifice to our God. 

{5:9} Let there more work be laid upon themen, that they may labour therein; and let them not regard vain words.   

{5:10} And the taskmasters of the people went out, and theirofficers, and they spake to the people, saying, Thus saith Pharaoh, Iwill not give you straw. 

{5:11} Go ye, get you straw where ye can findit: yet not ought of your work shall be diminished. 

{5:12} So thepeople were scattered abroad throughout all the land of Egypt to gatherstubble instead of straw. 

{5:13} And the taskmasters hasted [them,]saying, Fulfil your works, [your] daily tasks, as when there was straw.

{5:14} And the officers of the children of Israel, which Pharaoh'staskmasters had set over them, were beaten, [and] demanded, Whereforehave ye not fulfilled your task in making brick both yesterday and today, as heretofore?   

{5:15} Then the officers of the children of Israel came and criedunto Pharaoh, saying, Wherefore dealest thou thus with thy servants?

{5:16} There is no straw given unto thy servants, and they say to us,Make brick: and, behold, thy servants [are] beaten; but the fault [is]in thine own people. 

{5:17} But he said, Ye [are] idle, [ye are] idle:therefore ye say, Let us go [and] do sacrifice to the LORD. 

{5:18} Gotherefore now, [and] work; for there shall no straw be given you, yetshall ye deliver the tale of bricks. 

{5:19} And the officers of thechildren of Israel did see [that] they [were] in evil [case,] after itwas said, Ye shall not minish [ought] from your bricks of your dailytask.   

{5:20} And they met Moses and Aaron, who stood in the way, as theycame forth from Pharaoh: 

{5:21} And they said unto them, The LORD lookupon you, and judge; because ye have made our savour to be abhorred inthe eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his servants, to put a sword intheir hand to slay us. 

{5:22} And Moses returned unto the LORD, andsaid, Lord, wherefore hast thou [so] evil entreated this people? why[is] it [that] thou hast sent me? 

{5:23} For since I came to Pharaoh tospeak in thy name, he hath done evil to this people; neither hast thoudelivered thy people at all.   

{6:1} Then the LORD said unto Moses, Now shalt thou see what I willdo to Pharaoh: for with a strong hand shall he let them go, and with astrong hand shall he drive them out of his land. 

{6:2} And God spakeunto Moses, and said unto him, I [am] the LORD: 

{6:3} And I appearedunto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, by [the name of] GodAlmighty, but by my name JEHOVAH was I not known to them. 

{6:4} And Ihave also established my covenant with them, to give them the land ofCanaan, the land of their pilgrimage, wherein they were strangers.

{6:5} And I have also heard the groaning of the children of Israel,whom the Egyptians keep in bondage; and I have remembered my covenant.

{6:6} Wherefore say unto the children of Israel, I [am] the LORD, and Iwill bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and I willrid you out of their bondage, and I will redeem you with a stretchedout arm, and with great judgments: 

{6:7} And I will take you to me fora people, and I will be to you a God: and ye shall know that I [am] theLORD your God, which bringeth you out from under the burdens of theEgyptians. 

{6:8} And I will bring you in unto the land, concerning thewhich I did swear to give it to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; and Iwill give it you for an heritage: I [am] the LORD.   

{6:9} And Moses spake so unto the children of Israel: but theyhearkened not unto Moses for anguish of spirit, and for cruel bondage.

{6:10} And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 

{6:11} Go in, speak untoPharaoh king of Egypt, that he let the children of Israel go out of hisland. 

{6:12} And Moses spake before the LORD, saying, Behold, thechildren of Israel have not hearkened unto me; how then shall Pharaohhear me, who [am] of uncircumcised lips? 

{6:13} And the LORD spake untoMoses and unto Aaron, and gave them a charge unto the children ofIsrael, and unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring the children of Israelout of the land of Egypt.   

{6:14} These [be] the heads of their fathers' houses: The sons ofReuben the firstborn of Israel; Hanoch, and Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi:these [be] the families of Reuben. 

{6:15} And the sons of Simeon;Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin, and Zohar, and Shaul the sonof a Canaanitish woman: these [are] the families of Simeon.   

{6:16} And these [are] the names of the sons of Levi according totheir generations; Gershon, and Kohath, and Merari: and the years ofthe life of Levi [were] an hundred thirty and seven years. 

{6:17} Thesons of Gershon; Libni, and Shimi, according to their families. 

{6:18}And the sons of Kohath; Amram, and Izhar, and Hebron, and Uzziel: andthe years of the life of Kohath [were] an hundred thirty and threeyears. 

{6:19} And the sons of Merari; Mahali and Mushi: these [are] thefamilies of Levi according to their generations. 

{6:20} And Amram tookhim Jochebed his father's sister to wife; and she bare him Aaron andMoses: and the years of the life of Amram [were] an hundred and thirtyand seven years.   

{6:21} And the sons of Izhar; Korah, and Nepheg, and Zichri. 

{6:22}And the sons of Uzziel; Mishael, and Elzaphan, and Zithri. 

{6:23} AndAaron took him Elisheba, daughter of Amminadab, sister of Naashon, towife; and she bare him Nadab, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar. 

{6:24}And the sons of Korah; Assir, and Elkanah, and Abiasaph: these [are]the families of the Korhites. 

{6:25} And Eleazar Aaron's son took him[one] of the daughters of Putiel to wife; and she bare him Phinehas:these [are] the heads of the fathers of the Levites according to theirfamilies. 

{6:26} These [are] that Aaron and Moses, to whom the LORDsaid, Bring out the children of Israel from the land of Egypt accordingto their armies. 

{6:27} These [are] they which spake to Pharaoh king ofEgypt, to bring out the children of Israel from Egypt: these [are] thatMoses and Aaron.   

{6:28} And it came to pass on the day [when] the LORD spake untoMoses in the land of Egypt, 

{6:29} That the LORD spake unto Moses,saying, I [am] the LORD: speak thou unto Pharaoh king of Egypt all thatI say unto thee. 

{6:30} And Moses said before the LORD, Behold, I [am]of uncircumcised lips, and how shall Pharaoh hearken unto me?   

{7:1} And the LORD said unto Moses, See, I have made thee a god toPharaoh: and Aaron thy brother shall be thy prophet. 

{7:2} Thou shaltspeak all that I command thee: and Aaron thy brother shall speak untoPharaoh, that he send the children of Israel out of his land. 

{7:3} AndI will harden Pharaoh's heart, and multiply my signs and my wonders inthe land of Egypt. 

{7:4} But Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you, that Imay lay my hand upon Egypt, and bring forth mine armies, [and] mypeople the children of Israel, out of the land of Egypt by greatjudgments. 

{7:5} And the Egyptians shall know that I [am] the LORD,when I stretch forth mine hand upon Egypt, and bring out the childrenof Israel from among them. 

{7:6} And Moses and Aaron did as the LORDcommanded them, so did they. 

{7:7} And Moses [was] fourscore years old,and Aaron fourscore and three years old, when they spake unto Pharaoh.   

{7:8} And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying, 

{7:9}When Pharaoh shall speak unto you, saying, Shew a miracle for you: thenthou shalt say unto Aaron, Take thy rod, and cast [it] before Pharaoh,[and] it shall become a serpent.   

{7:10} And Moses and Aaron went in unto Pharaoh, and they did so asthe LORD had commanded: and Aaron cast down his rod before Pharaoh, andbefore his servants, and it became a serpent. 

{7:11} Then Pharaoh alsocalled the wise men and the sorcerers: now the magicians of Egypt, theyalso did in like manner with their enchantments. 

{7:12} For they castdown every man his rod, and they became serpents: but Aaron's rodswallowed up their rods. 

{7:13} And he hardened Pharaoh's heart, thathe hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had said.   

{7:14} And the LORD said unto Moses, Pharaoh's heart [is] hardened,he refuseth to let the people go. 

{7:15} Get thee unto Pharaoh in themorning; lo, he goeth out unto the water; and thou shalt stand by theriver's brink against he come; and the rod which was turned to aserpent shalt thou take in thine hand. 

{7:16} And thou shalt say untohim, The LORD God of the Hebrews hath sent me unto thee, saying, Let mypeople go, that they may serve me in the wilderness: and, behold,hitherto thou wouldest not hear. 

{7:17} Thus saith the LORD, In thisthou shalt know that I [am] the LORD: behold, I will smite with the rodthat [is] in mine hand upon the waters which [are] in the river, andthey shall be turned to blood. 

{7:18} And the fish that [is] in theriver shall die, and the river shall stink; and the Egyptians shalllothe to drink of the water of the river.   

{7:19} And the LORD spake unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Take thy rod,and stretch out thine hand upon the waters of Egypt, upon theirstreams, upon their rivers, and upon their ponds, and upon all theirpools of water, that they may become blood; and [that] there may beblood throughout all the land of Egypt, both in [vessels of] wood, andin [vessels of] stone. 

{7:20} And Moses and Aaron did so, as the LORDcommanded; and he lifted up the rod, and smote the waters that [were]in the river, in the sight of Pharaoh, and in the sight of hisservants; and all the waters that [were] in the river were turned toblood. 

{7:21} And the fish that [was] in the river died; and the riverstank, and the Egyptians could not drink of the water of the river; andthere was blood throughout all the land of Egypt. 

{7:22} And themagicians of Egypt did so with their enchantments: and Pharaoh's heartwas hardened, neither did he hearken unto them; as the LORD had said.

{7:23} And Pharaoh turned and went into his house, neither did he sethis heart to this also. 

{7:24} And all the Egyptians digged round aboutthe river for water to drink; for they could not drink of the water ofthe river. 

{7:25} And seven days were fulfilled, after that the LORDhad smitten the river.   

{8:1} And the LORD spake unto Moses, Go unto Pharaoh, and say untohim, Thus saith the LORD, Let my people go, that they may serve me.

{8:2} And if thou refuse to let [them] go, behold, I will smite all thyborders with frogs: 

{8:3} And the river shall bring forth frogsabundantly, which shall go up and come into thine house, and into thybedchamber, and upon thy bed, and into the house of thy servants, andupon thy people, and into thine ovens, and into thy kneadingtroughs:

{8:4} And the frogs shall come up both on thee, and upon thy people,and upon all thy servants.   

{8:5} And the LORD spake unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch forththine hand with thy rod over the streams, over the rivers, and over theponds, and cause frogs to come up upon the land of Egypt. 

{8:6} AndAaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt; and the frogscame up, and covered the land of Egypt. 

{8:7} And the magicians did sowith their enchantments, and brought up frogs upon the land of Egypt.   

{8:8} Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron, and said, Intreat theLORD, that he may take away the frogs from me, and from my people; andI will let the people go, that they may do sacrifice unto the LORD.

{8:9} And Moses said unto Pharaoh, Glory over me: when shall I intreatfor thee, and for thy servants, and for thy people, to destroy thefrogs from thee and thy houses, [that] they may remain in the riveronly? 

{8:10} And he said, To morrow. And he said, [Be it] according tothy word: that thou mayest know that [there is] none like unto the LORDour God. 

{8:11} And the frogs shall depart from thee, and from thyhouses, and from thy servants, and from thy people; they shall remainin the river only. 

{8:12} And Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh:and Moses cried unto the LORD because of the frogs which he had broughtagainst Pharaoh. 

{8:13} And the LORD did according to the word ofMoses; and the frogs died out of the houses, out of the villages, andout of the fields. 

{8:14} And they gathered them together upon heaps:and the land stank. 

{8:15} But when Pharaoh saw that there was respite,he hardened his heart, and hearkened not unto them; as the LORD hadsaid.   

{8:16} And the LORD said unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch out thyrod, and smite the dust of the land, that it may become lice throughoutall the land of Egypt. 

{8:17} And they did so; for Aaron stretched outhis hand with his rod, and smote the dust of the earth, and it becamelice in man, and in beast; all the dust of the land became licethroughout all the land of Egypt. 

{8:18} And the magicians did so withtheir enchantments to bring forth lice, but they could not: so therewere lice upon man, and upon beast. 

{8:19} Then the magicians said untoPharaoh, This [is] the finger of God: and Pharaoh's heart was hardened,and he hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had said.   

{8:20} And the LORD said unto Moses, Rise up early in the morning,and stand before Pharaoh; lo, he cometh forth to the water; and sayunto him, Thus saith the LORD, Let my people go, that they may serveme. 

{8:21} Else, if thou wilt not let my people go, behold, I will sendswarms [of flies] upon thee, and upon thy servants, and upon thypeople, and into thy houses: and the houses of the Egyptians shall befull of swarms [of flies,] and also the ground whereon they [are.]

{8:22} And I will sever in that day the land of Goshen, in which mypeople dwell, that no swarms [of flies] shall be there; to the end thoumayest know that I [am] the LORD in the midst of the earth. 

{8:23} AndI will put a division between my people and thy people: to morrow shallthis sign be. 

{8:24} And the LORD did so; and there came a grievousswarm [of flies] into the house of Pharaoh, and [into] his servants'houses, and into all the land of Egypt: the land was corrupted byreason of the swarm [of flies.]   

{8:25} And Pharaoh called for Moses and for Aaron, and said, Go ye,sacrifice to your God in the land. 

{8:26} And Moses said, It is notmeet so to do; for we shall sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptiansto the LORD our God: lo, shall we sacrifice the abomination of theEgyptians before their eyes, and will they not stone us? 

{8:27} We willgo three days' journey into the wilderness, and sacrifice to the LORDour God, as he shall command us. 

{8:28} And Pharaoh said, I will letyou go, that ye may sacrifice to the LORD your God in the wilderness;only ye shall not go very far away: intreat for me. 

{8:29} And Mosessaid, Behold, I go out from thee, and I will intreat the LORD that theswarms [of flies] may depart from Pharaoh, from his servants, and fromhis people, to morrow: but let not Pharaoh deal deceitfully any more innot letting the people go to sacrifice to the LORD. 

{8:30} And Moseswent out from Pharaoh, and intreated the LORD. 

{8:31} And the LORD didaccording to the word of Moses; and he removed the swarms [of flies]from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people; there remainednot one. 

{8:32} And Pharaoh hardened his heart at this time also,neither would he let the people go.   

{9:1} Then the LORD said unto Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh, and tellhim, Thus saith the LORD God of the Hebrews, Let my people go, thatthey may serve me. 

{9:2} For if thou refuse to let [them] go, and wilthold them still, 

{9:3} Behold, the hand of the LORD is upon thy cattlewhich [is] in the field, upon the horses, upon the asses, upon thecamels, upon the oxen, and upon the sheep: [there shall be] a verygrievous murrain. 

{9:4} And the LORD shall sever between the cattle ofIsrael and the cattle of Egypt: and there shall nothing die of all[that is] the children's of Israel. 

{9:5} And the LORD appointed a settime, saying, To morrow the LORD shall do this thing in the land. 

{9:6}And the LORD did that thing on the morrow, and all the cattle of Egyptdied: but of the cattle of the children of Israel died not one. 

{9:7}And Pharaoh sent, and, behold, there was not one of the cattle of theIsraelites dead. And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, and he did notlet the people go.   

{9:8} And the LORD said unto Moses and unto Aaron, Take to youhandfuls of ashes of the furnace, and let Moses sprinkle it toward theheaven in the sight of Pharaoh. 

{9:9} And it shall become small dust inall the land of Egypt, and shall be a boil breaking forth [with] blainsupon man, and upon beast, throughout all the land of Egypt. 

{9:10} Andthey took ashes of the furnace, and stood before Pharaoh; and Mosessprinkled it up toward heaven; and it became a boil breaking forth[with] blains upon man, and upon beast. 

{9:11} And the magicians couldnot stand before Moses because of the boils; for the boil was upon themagicians, and upon all the Egyptians. 

{9:12} And the LORD hardened theheart of Pharaoh, and he hearkened not unto them; as the LORD hadspoken unto Moses.   

{9:13} And the LORD said unto Moses, Rise up early in the morning,and stand before Pharaoh, and say unto him, Thus saith the LORD God ofthe Hebrews, Let my people go, that they may serve me. 

{9:14} For Iwill at this time send all my plagues upon thine heart, and upon thyservants, and upon thy people; that thou mayest know that [there is]none like me in all the earth. 

{9:15} For now I will stretch out myhand, that I may smite thee and thy people with pestilence; and thoushalt be cut off from the earth. 

{9:16} And in very deed for this[cause] have I raised thee up, for to shew [in] thee my power; and thatmy name may be declared throughout all the earth. 

{9:17} As yetexaltest thou thyself against my people, that thou wilt not let themgo? 

{9:18} Behold, to morrow about this time I will cause it to rain avery grievous hail, such as hath not been in Egypt since the foundationthereof even until now. 

{9:19} Send therefore now, [and] gather thycattle, and all that thou hast in the field; [for upon] every man andbeast which shall be found in the field, and shall not be brought home,the hail shall come down upon them, and they shall die. 

{9:20} He thatfeared the word of the LORD among the servants of Pharaoh made hisservants and his cattle flee into the houses: 

{9:21} And he thatregarded not the word of the LORD left his servants and his cattle inthe field.   

{9:22} And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch forth thine hand towardheaven, that there may be hail in all the land of Egypt, upon man, andupon beast, and upon every herb of the field, throughout the land ofEgypt. 

{9:23} And Moses stretched forth his rod toward heaven: and theLORD sent thunder and hail, and the fire ran along upon the ground; andthe LORD rained hail upon the land of Egypt. 

{9:24} So there was hail,and fire mingled with the hail, very grievous, such as there was nonelike it in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation. 

{9:25} Andthe hail smote throughout all the land of Egypt all that [was] in thefield, both man and beast; and the hail smote every herb of the field,and brake every tree of the field. 

{9:26} Only in the land of Goshen,where the children of Israel [were,] was there no hail.   

{9:27} And Pharaoh sent, and called for Moses and Aaron, and saidunto them, I have sinned this time: the LORD [is] righteous, and I andmy people [are] wicked. 

{9:28} Intreat the LORD (for [it is] enough)that there be no [more] mighty thunderings and hail; and I will let yougo, and ye shall stay no longer. 

{9:29} And Moses said unto him, Assoon as I am gone out of the city, I will spread abroad my hands untothe LORD; [and] the thunder shall cease, neither shall there be anymore hail; that thou mayest know how that the earth [is] the LORD'S.

{9:30} But as for thee and thy servants, I know that ye will not yetfear the LORD God. 

{9:31} And the flax and the barley was smitten: forthe barley was in the ear, and the flax [was] bolled. 

{9:32} But thewheat and the rie were not smitten: for they [were] not grown up.

{9:33} And Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh, and spread abroadhis hands unto the LORD: and the thunders and hail ceased, and the rainwas not poured upon the earth. 

{9:34} And when Pharaoh saw that therain and the hail and the thunders were ceased, he sinned yet more, andhardened his heart, he and his servants. 

{9:35} And the heart ofPharaoh was hardened, neither would he let the children of Israel go;as the LORD had spoken by Moses.   

{10:1} And the LORD said unto Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh: for I havehardened his heart, and the heart of his servants, that I might shewthese my signs before him: 

{10:2} And that thou mayest tell in the earsof thy son, and of thy son's son, what things I have wrought in Egypt,and my signs which I have done among them; that ye may know how that I[am] the LORD. 

{10:3} And Moses and Aaron came in unto Pharaoh, andsaid unto him, Thus saith the LORD God of the Hebrews, How long wiltthou refuse to humble thyself before me? let my people go, that theymay serve me. 

{10:4} Else, if thou refuse to let my people go, behold,to morrow will I bring the locusts into thy coast: 

{10:5} And theyshall cover the face of the earth, that one cannot be able to see theearth: and they shall eat the residue of that which is escaped, whichremaineth unto you from the hail, and shall eat every tree whichgroweth for you out of the field: 

{10:6} And they shall fill thyhouses, and the houses of all thy servants, and the houses of all theEgyptians; which neither thy fathers, nor thy fathers' fathers haveseen, since the day that they were upon the earth unto this day. And heturned himself, and went out from Pharaoh. 

{10:7} And Pharaoh'sservants said unto him, How long shall this man be a snare unto us? letthe men go, that they may serve the LORD their God: knowest thou notyet that Egypt is destroyed? 

{10:8} And Moses and Aaron were broughtagain unto Pharaoh: and he said unto them, Go, serve the LORD your God:[but] who [are] they that shall go? 

{10:9} And Moses said, We will gowith our young and with our old, with our sons and with our daughters,with our flocks and with our herds will we go; for we [must hold] afeast unto the LORD. 

{10:10} And he said unto them, Let the LORD be sowith you, as I will let you go, and your little ones: look [to it;] forevil [is] before you. 

{10:11} Not so: go now ye [that are] men, andserve the LORD; for that ye did desire. And they were driven out fromPharaoh's presence.   

{10:12} And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand overthe land of Egypt for the locusts, that they may come up upon the landof Egypt, and eat every herb of the land, [even] all that the hail hathleft. 

{10:13} And Moses stretched forth his rod over the land of Egypt,and the LORD brought an east wind upon the land all that day, and all[that] night; [and] when it was morning, the east wind brought thelocusts. 

{10:14} And the locusts went up over all the land of Egypt,and rested in all the coasts of Egypt: very grievous [were they;]before them there were no such locusts as they, neither after themshall be such. 

{10:15} For they covered the face of the whole earth, sothat the land was darkened; and they did eat every herb of the land,and all the fruit of the trees which the hail had left: and thereremained not any green thing in the trees, or in the herbs of thefield, through all the land of Egypt.   

{10:16} Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron in haste; and hesaid, I have sinned against the LORD your God, and against you. 

{10:17}Now therefore forgive, I pray thee, my sin only this once, and intreatthe LORD your God, that he may take away from me this death only.

{10:18} And he went out from Pharaoh, and intreated the LORD. 

{10:19}And the LORD turned a mighty strong west wind, which took away thelocusts, and cast them into the Red sea; there remained not one locustin all the coasts of Egypt. 

{10:20} But the LORD hardened Pharaoh'sheart, so that he would not let the children of Israel go.   

{10:21} And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand towardheaven, that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt, evendarkness [which] may be felt. 

{10:22} And Moses stretched forth hishand toward heaven; and there was a thick darkness in all the land ofEgypt three days: 

{10:23} They saw not one another, neither rose anyfrom his place for three days: but all the children of Israel had lightin their dwellings.   

{10:24} And Pharaoh called unto Moses, and said, Go ye, serve theLORD; only let your flocks and your herds be stayed: let your littleones also go with you. 

{10:25} And Moses said, Thou must give us alsosacrifices and burnt offerings, that we may sacrifice unto the LORD ourGod. 

{10:26} Our cattle also shall go with us; there shall not an hoofbe left behind; for thereof must we take to serve the LORD our God; andwe know not with what we must serve the LORD, until we come thither.   

{10:27} But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he would not letthem go. 

{10:28} And Pharaoh said unto him, Get thee from me, take heedto thyself, see my face no more; for in [that] day thou seest my facethou shalt die. 

{10:29} And Moses said, Thou hast spoken well, I willsee thy face again no more.   

{11:1} And the LORD said unto Moses, Yet will I bring one plague[more] upon Pharaoh, and upon Egypt; afterwards he will let you gohence: when he shall let [you] go, he shall surely thrust you out hencealtogether. 

{11:2} Speak now in the ears of the people, and let everyman borrow of his neighbour, and every woman of her neighbour, jewelsof silver, and jewels of gold. 

{11:3} And the LORD gave the peoplefavour in the sight of the Egyptians. Moreover the man Moses [was] verygreat in the land of Egypt, in the sight of Pharaoh's servants, and inthe sight of the people. 

{11:4} And Moses said, Thus saith the LORD,About midnight will I go out into the midst of Egypt: 

{11:5} And allthe firstborn in the land of Egypt shall die, from the firstborn ofPharaoh that sitteth upon his throne, even unto the firstborn of themaidservant that [is] behind the mill; and all the firstborn of beasts.

{11:6} And there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt,such as there was none like it, nor shall be like it any more. 

{11:7}But against any of the children of Israel shall not a dog move histongue, against man or beast: that ye may know how that the LORD dothput a difference between the Egyptians and Israel. 

{11:8} And all thesethy servants shall come down unto me, and bow down themselves unto me,saying, Get thee out, and all the people that follow thee: and afterthat I will go out. And he went out from Pharaoh in a great anger.

{11:9} And the LORD said unto Moses, Pharaoh shall not hearken untoyou; that my wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt. 

{11:10}And Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh: and the LORDhardened Pharaoh's heart, so that he would not let the children ofIsrael go out of his land.   

{12:1} And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt,saying, 

{12:2} This month [shall be] unto you the beginning of months:it [shall be] the first month of the year to you.   

{12:3} Speak ye unto all the congregation of Israel, saying, In thetenth [day] of this month they shall take to them every man a lamb,according to the house of [their] fathers, a lamb for an house: 

{12:4}And if the household be too little for the lamb, let him and hisneighbour next unto his house take [it] according to the number of thesouls; every man according to his eating shall make your count for thelamb. 

{12:5} Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male of the firstyear: ye shall take [it] out from the sheep, or from the goats: 

{12:6}And ye shall keep it up until the fourteenth day of the same month: andthe whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it in theevening. 

{12:7} And they shall take of the blood, and strike [it] onthe two side posts and on the upper door post of the houses, whereinthey shall eat it. 

{12:8} And they shall eat the flesh in that night,roast with fire, and unleavened bread; [and] with bitter [herbs] theyshall eat it. 

{12:9} Eat not of it raw, nor sodden at all with water,but roast [with] fire; his head with his legs, and with the purtenancethereof. 

{12:10} And ye shall let nothing of it remain until themorning; and that which remaineth of it until the morning ye shall burnwith fire.   

{12:11} And thus shall ye eat it; [with] your loins girded, yourshoes on your feet, and your staff in your hand; and ye shall eat it inhaste: it [is] the LORD'S passover. 

{12:12} For I will pass through theland of Egypt this night, and will smite all the firstborn in the landof Egypt, both man and beast; and against all the gods of Egypt I willexecute judgment: I [am] the LORD. 

{12:13} And the blood shall be toyou for a token upon the houses where ye [are:] and when I see theblood, I will pass over you, and the plague shall not be upon you todestroy [you,] when I smite the land of Egypt. 

{12:14} And this dayshall be unto you for a memorial; and ye shall keep it a feast to theLORD throughout your generations; ye shall keep it a feast by anordinance for ever. 

{12:15} Seven days shall ye eat unleavened bread;even the first day ye shall put away leaven out of your houses: forwhosoever eateth leavened bread from the first day until the seventhday, that soul shall be cut off from Israel. 

{12:16} And in the firstday [there shall be] an holy convocation, and in the seventh day thereshall be an holy convocation to you; no manner of work shall be done inthem, save [that] which every man must eat, that only may be done ofyou. 

{12:17} And ye shall observe [the feast of] unleavened bread; forin this selfsame day have I brought your armies out of the land ofEgypt: therefore shall ye observe this day in your generations by anordinance for ever.   

{12:18} In the first [month,] on the fourteenth day of the month ateven, ye shall eat unleavened bread, until the one and twentieth day ofthe month at even. 

{12:19} Seven days shall there be no leaven found inyour houses: for whosoever eateth that which is leavened, even thatsoul shall be cut off from the congregation of Israel, whether he be astranger, or born in the land. 

{12:20} Ye shall eat nothing leavened;in all your habitations shall ye eat unleavened bread.   

{12:21} Then Moses called for all the elders of Israel, and saidunto them, Draw out and take you a lamb according to your families, andkill the passover. 

{12:22} And ye shall take a bunch of hyssop, and dip[it] in the blood that [is] in the bason, and strike the lintel and thetwo side posts with the blood that [is] in the bason; and none of youshall go out at the door of his house until the morning. 

{12:23} Forthe LORD will pass through to smite the Egyptians; and when he seeththe blood upon the lintel, and on the two side posts, the LORD willpass over the door, and will not suffer the destroyer to come in untoyour houses to smite [you. ]

{12:24} And ye shall observe this thing foran ordinance to thee and to thy sons for ever. 

{12:25} And it shallcome to pass, when ye be come to the land which the LORD will give you,according as he hath promised, that ye shall keep this service. 

{12:26}And it shall come to pass, when your children shall say unto you, Whatmean ye by this service? 

{12:27} That ye shall say, It [is] thesacrifice of the LORD'S passover, who passed over the houses of thechildren of Israel in Egypt, when he smote the Egyptians, and deliveredour houses. And the people bowed the head and worshipped. 

{12:28} Andthe children of Israel went away, and did as the LORD had commandedMoses and Aaron, so did they.   

{12:29} And it came to pass, that at midnight the LORD smote all thefirstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh that saton his throne unto the firstborn of the captive that [was] in thedungeon; and all the firstborn of cattle. 

{12:30} And Pharaoh rose upin the night, he, and all his servants, and all the Egyptians; andthere was a great cry in Egypt; for [there was] not a house where[there was] not one dead.   

{12:31} And he called for Moses and Aaron by night, and said, Riseup, [and] get you forth from among my people, both ye and the childrenof Israel; and go, serve the LORD, as ye have said. 

{12:32} Also takeyour flocks and your herds, as ye have said, and be gone; and bless mealso. 

{12:33} And the Egyptians were urgent upon the people, that theymight send them out of the land in haste; for they said, We [be] alldead [men. ]

{12:34} And the people took their dough before it wasleavened, their kneadingtroughs being bound up in their clothes upontheir shoulders. 

{12:35} And the children of Israel did according tothe word of Moses; and they borrowed of the Egyptians jewels of silver,and jewels of gold, and raiment: 

{12:36} And the LORD gave the peoplefavour in the sight of the Egyptians, so that they lent unto them [suchthings as they required.] And they spoiled the Egyptians.   

{12:37} And the children of Israel journeyed from Rameses toSuccoth, about six hundred thousand on foot [that were] men, besidechildren. 

{12:38} And a mixed multitude went up also with them; andflocks, and herds, [even] very much cattle. 

{12:39} And they bakedunleavened cakes of the dough which they brought forth out of Egypt,for it was not leavened; because they were thrust out of Egypt, andcould not tarry, neither had they prepared for themselves any victual.   

{12:40} Now the sojourning of the children of Israel, who dwelt inEgypt, [was] four hundred and thirty years. 

{12:41} And it came to passat the end of the four hundred and thirty years, even the selfsame dayit came to pass, that all the hosts of the LORD went out from the landof Egypt. 

{12:42} It [is] a night to be much observed unto the LORD forbringing them out from the land of Egypt: this [is] that night of theLORD to be observed of all the children of Israel in their generations.   

{12:43} And the LORD said unto Moses and Aaron, This [is] theordinance of the passover: There shall no stranger eat thereof: 

{12:44}But every man's servant that is bought for money, when thou hastcircumcised him, then shall he eat thereof. 

{12:45} A foreigner and anhired servant shall not eat thereof. 

{12:46} In one house shall it beeaten; thou shalt not carry forth ought of the flesh abroad out of thehouse; neither shall ye break a bone thereof. 

{12:47} All thecongregation of Israel shall keep it. 

{12:48} And when a stranger shallsojourn with thee, and will keep the passover to the LORD, let all hismales be circumcised, and then let him come near and keep it; and heshall be as one that is born in the land: for no uncircumcised personshall eat thereof. 

{12:49} One law shall be to him that is homeborn,and unto the stranger that sojourneth among you. 

{12:50} Thus did allthe children of Israel; as the LORD commanded Moses and Aaron, so didthey. 

{12:51} And it came to pass the selfsame day, [that] the LORD didbring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their armies.   

{13:1} And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 

{13:2} Sanctify untome all the firstborn, whatsoever openeth the womb among the children ofIsrael, [both] of man and of beast: it [is] mine.   

{13:3} And Moses said unto the people, Remember this day, in whichye came out from Egypt, out of the house of bondage; for by strength ofhand the LORD brought you out from this [place:] there shall noleavened bread be eaten. 

{13:4} This day came ye out in the month Abib.   

{13:5} And it shall be when the LORD shall bring thee into the landof the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Hivites,and the Jebusites, which he sware unto thy fathers to give thee, a landflowing with milk and honey, that thou shalt keep this service in thismonth. 

{13:6} Seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread, and in theseventh day [shall be] a feast to the LORD. 

{13:7} Unleavened breadshall be eaten seven days; and there shall no leavened bread be seenwith thee, neither shall there be leaven seen with thee in all thyquarters.   

{13:8} And thou shalt shew thy son in that day, saying, [This isdone] because of that [which] the LORD did unto me when I came forthout of Egypt. 

{13:9} And it shall be for a sign unto thee upon thinehand, and for a memorial between thine eyes, that the LORD'S law may bein thy mouth: for with a strong hand hath the LORD brought thee out ofEgypt. 

{13:10} Thou shalt therefore keep this ordinance in his seasonfrom year to year.   

{13:11} And it shall be when the LORD shall bring thee into the landof the Canaanites, as he sware unto thee and to thy fathers, and shallgive it thee, 

{13:12} That thou shalt set apart unto the LORD all thatopeneth the matrix, and every firstling that cometh of a beast whichthou hast; the males [shall be] the LORD'S. 

{13:13} And every firstlingof an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb; and if thou wilt not redeemit, then thou shalt break his neck: and all the firstborn of man amongthy children shalt thou redeem.   

{13:14} And it shall be when thy son asketh thee in time to come,saying, What [is] this? that thou shalt say unto him, By strength ofhand the LORD brought us out from Egypt, from the house of bondage:

{13:15} And it came to pass, when Pharaoh would hardly let us go, thatthe LORD slew all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both thefirstborn of man, and the firstborn of beast: therefore I sacrifice tothe LORD all that openeth the matrix, being males; but all thefirstborn of my children I redeem. 

{13:16} And it shall be for a tokenupon thine hand, and for frontlets between thine eyes: for by strengthof hand the LORD brought us forth out of Egypt.   

{13:17} And it came to pass, when Pharaoh had let the people go,that God led them not [through] the way of the land of the Philistines,although that [was] near; for God said, Lest peradventure the peoplerepent when they see war, and they return to Egypt: 

{13:18} But God ledthe people about, [through] the way of the wilderness of the Red sea:and the children of Israel went up harnessed out of the land of Egypt.

{13:19} And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him: for he hadstraitly sworn the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visityou; and ye shall carry up my bones away hence with you.   

{13:20} And they took their journey from Succoth, and encamped inEtham, in the edge of the wilderness. 

{13:21} And the LORD went beforethem by day in a pillar of a cloud, to lead them the way; and by nightin a pillar of fire, to give them light; to go by day and night:

{13:22} He took not away the pillar of the cloud by day, nor the pillarof fire by night, [from] before the people.   

{14:1} And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 

{14:2} Speak unto thechildren of Israel, that they turn and encamp before Pi-hahiroth,between Migdol and the sea, over against Baal-zephon: before it shallye encamp by the sea. 

{14:3} For Pharaoh will say of the children ofIsrael, They [are] entangled in the land, the wilderness hath shut themin. 

{14:4} And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, that he shall followafter them; and I will be honoured upon Pharaoh, and upon all his host;that the Egyptians may know that I [am] the LORD. And they did so.   

{14:5} And it was told the king of Egypt that the people fled: andthe heart of Pharaoh and of his servants was turned against the people,and they said, Why have we done this, that we have let Israel go fromserving us? 

{14:6} And he made ready his chariot, and took his peoplewith him: 

{14:7} And he took six hundred chosen chariots, and all thechariots of Egypt, and captains over every one of them. 

{14:8} And theLORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he pursued afterthe children of Israel: and the children of Israel went out with anhigh hand. 

{14:9} But the Egyptians pursued after them, all the horses[and] chariots of Pharaoh, and his horsemen, and his army, and overtookthem encamping by the sea, beside Pi-hahiroth, before Baal-zephon.   

{14:10} And when Pharaoh drew nigh, the children of Israel lifted uptheir eyes, and, behold, the Egyptians marched after them; and theywere sore afraid: and the children of Israel cried out unto the LORD.

{14:11} And they said unto Moses, Because [there were] no graves inEgypt, hast thou taken us away to die in the wilderness? wherefore hastthou dealt thus with us, to carry us forth out of Egypt? 

{14:12} [Is]not this the word that we did tell thee in Egypt, saying, Let us alone,that we may serve the Egyptians? For [it had been] better for us toserve the Egyptians, than that we should die in the wilderness.   

{14:13} And Moses said unto the people, Fear ye not, stand still,and see the salvation of the LORD, which he will shew to you to day:for the Egyptians whom ye have seen to day, ye shall see them again nomore for ever. 

{14:14} The LORD shall fight for you, and ye shall holdyour peace.   

{14:15} And the LORD said unto Moses, Wherefore criest thou unto me?speak unto the children of Israel, that they go forward: 

{14:16} Butlift thou up thy rod, and stretch out thine hand over the sea, anddivide it: and the children of Israel shall go on dry [ground] throughthe midst of the sea. 

{14:17} And I, behold, I will harden the heartsof the Egyptians, and they shall follow them: and I will get me honourupon Pharaoh, and upon all his host, upon his chariots, and upon hishorsemen. 

{14:18} And the Egyptians shall know that I [am] the LORD,when I have gotten me honour upon Pharaoh, upon his chariots, and uponhis horsemen.   

{14:19} And the angel of God, which went before the camp of Israel,removed and went behind them; and the pillar of the cloud went frombefore their face, and stood behind them: 

{14:20} And it came betweenthe camp of the Egyptians and the camp of Israel; and it was a cloudand darkness [to them,] but it gave light by night [to these:] so thatthe one came not near the other all the night. 

{14:21} And Mosesstretched out his hand over the sea; and the LORD caused the sea to go[back] by a strong east wind all that night, and made the sea dry[land,] and the waters were divided. 

{14:22} And the children of Israelwent into the midst of the sea upon the dry [ground:] and the waters[were] a wall unto them on their right hand, and on their left.   

{14:23} And the Egyptians pursued, and went in after them to themidst of the sea, [even] all Pharaoh's horses, his chariots, and hishorsemen. 

{14:24} And it came to pass, that in the morning watch theLORD looked unto the host of the Egyptians through the pillar of fireand of the cloud, and troubled the host of the Egyptians, 

{14:25} Andtook off their chariot wheels, that they drave them heavily: so thatthe Egyptians said, Let us flee from the face of Israel; for the LORDfighteth for them against the Egyptians.   

{14:26} And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand overthe sea, that the waters may come again upon the Egyptians, upon theirchariots, and upon their horsemen. 

{14:27} And Moses stretched forthhis hand over the sea, and the sea returned to his strength when themorning appeared; and the Egyptians fled against it; and the LORDoverthrew the Egyptians in the midst of the sea. 

{14:28} And the watersreturned, and covered the chariots, and the horsemen, [and] all thehost of Pharaoh that came into the sea after them; there remained notso much as one of them. 

{14:29} But the children of Israel walked upondry [land] in the midst of the sea; and the waters [were] a wall untothem on their right hand, and on their left. 

{14:30} Thus the LORDsaved Israel that day out of the hand of the Egyptians; and Israel sawthe Egyptians dead upon the sea shore. 

{14:31} And Israel saw thatgreat work which the LORD did upon the Egyptians: and the people fearedthe LORD, and believed the LORD, and his servant Moses.   

{15:1} Then sang Moses and the children of Israel this song unto theLORD, and spake, saying, I will sing unto the LORD, for he hathtriumphed gloriously: the horse and his rider hath he thrown into thesea. 

{15:2} The LORD [is] my strength and song, and he is become mysalvation: he [is] my God, and I will prepare him an habitation; myfather's God, and I will exalt him. 

{15:3} The LORD [is] a man of war:the LORD [is] his name. 

{15:4} Pharaoh's chariots and his host hath hecast into the sea: his chosen captains also are drowned in the Red sea.

{15:5} The depths have covered them: they sank into the bottom as astone. 

{15:6} Thy right hand, O LORD, is become glorious in power: thyright hand, O LORD, hath dashed in pieces the enemy. 

{15:7} And in thegreatness of thine excellency thou hast overthrown them that rose upagainst thee: thou sentest forth thy wrath, [which] consumed them asstubble. 

{15:8} And with the blast of thy nostrils the waters weregathered together, the floods stood upright as an heap, [and] thedepths were congealed in the heart of the sea. 

{15:9} The enemy said, Iwill pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the spoil; my lust shall besatisfied upon them; I will draw my sword, my hand shall destroy them.

{15:10} Thou didst blow with thy wind, the sea covered them: they sankas lead in the mighty waters. 

{15:11} Who [is] like unto thee, O LORD,among the gods? who [is] like thee, glorious in holiness, fearful [in]praises, doing wonders? 

{15:12} Thou stretchedst out thy right hand,the earth swallowed them. 

{15:13} Thou in thy mercy hast led forth thepeople [which] thou hast redeemed: thou hast guided [them] in thystrength unto thy holy habitation. 

{15:14} The people shall hear, [and]be afraid: sorrow shall take hold on the inhabitants of Palestina.

{15:15} Then the dukes of Edom shall be amazed; the mighty men of Moab,trembling shall take hold upon them; all the inhabitants of Canaanshall melt away. 

{15:16} Fear and dread shall fall upon them; by thegreatness of thine arm they shall be [as] still as a stone; till thypeople pass over, O LORD, till the people pass over, [which] thou hastpurchased. 

{15:17} Thou shalt bring them in, and plant them in themountain of thine inheritance, [in] the place, O LORD, [which] thouhast made for thee to dwell in, in the Sanctuary, O Lord, [which] thyhands have established. 

{15:18} The LORD shall reign for ever and ever.

{15:19} For the horse of Pharaoh went in with his chariots and with hishorsemen into the sea, and the LORD brought again the waters of the seaupon them; but the children of Israel went on dry [land] in the midstof the sea.   

{15:20} And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took atimbrel in her hand; and all the women went out after her with timbrelsand with dances. 

{15:21} And Miriam answered them, Sing ye to the LORD,for he hath triumphed gloriously; the horse and his rider hath hethrown into the sea. 

{15:22} So Moses brought Israel from the Red sea,and they went out into the wilderness of Shur; and they went three daysin the wilderness, and found no water.   

{15:23} And when they came to Marah, they could not drink of thewaters of Marah, for they [were] bitter: therefore the name of it wascalled Marah. 

{15:24} And the people murmured against Moses, saying,What shall we drink? 

{15:25} And he cried unto the LORD; and the LORDshewed him a tree, [which] when he had cast into the waters, the waterswere made sweet: there he made for them a statute and an ordinance, andthere he proved them, 

{15:26} And said, If thou wilt diligently hearkento the voice of the LORD thy God, and wilt do that which is right inhis sight, and wilt give ear to his commandments, and keep all hisstatutes, I will put none of these diseases upon thee, which I havebrought upon the Egyptians: for I [am] the LORD that healeth thee.   

{15:27} And they came to Elim, where [were] twelve wells of water,and threescore and ten palm trees: and they encamped there by thewaters.   

{16:1} And they took their journey from Elim, and all thecongregation of the children of Israel came unto the wilderness of Sin,which [is] between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the secondmonth after their departing out of the land of Egypt. 

{16:2} And thewhole congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses andAaron in the wilderness: 

{16:3} And the children of Israel said untothem, Would to God we had died by the hand of the LORD in the land ofEgypt, when we sat by the flesh pots, [and] when we did eat bread tothe full; for ye have brought us forth into this wilderness, to killthis whole assembly with hunger.   

{16:4} Then said the LORD unto Moses, Behold, I will rain bread fromheaven for you; and the people shall go out and gather a certain rateevery day, that I may prove them, whether they will walk in my law, orno. 

{16:5} And it shall come to pass, that on the sixth day they shallprepare [that] which they bring in; and it shall be twice as much asthey gather daily. 

{16:6} And Moses and Aaron said unto all thechildren of Israel, At even, then ye shall know that the LORD hathbrought you out from the land of Egypt: 

{16:7} And in the morning, thenye shall see the glory of the LORD; for that he heareth your murmuringsagainst the LORD: and what [are] we, that ye murmur against us? 

{16:8}And Moses said, [This shall be,] when the LORD shall give you in theevening flesh to eat, and in the morning bread to the full; for thatthe LORD heareth your murmurings which ye murmur against him: and what[are] we? your murmurings [are] not against us, but against the LORD.   

{16:9} And Moses spake unto Aaron, Say unto all the congregation ofthe children of Israel, Come near before the LORD: for he hath heardyour murmurings. 

{16:10} And it came to pass, as Aaron spake unto thewhole congregation of the children of Israel, that they looked towardthe wilderness, and, behold, the glory of the LORD appeared in thecloud.   

{16:11} And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 

{16:12} I have heardthe murmurings of the children of Israel: speak unto them, saying, Ateven ye shall eat flesh, and in the morning ye shall be filled withbread; and ye shall know that I [am] the LORD your God. 

{16:13} And itcame to pass, that at even the quails came up, and covered the camp:and in the morning the dew lay round about the host. 

{16:14} And whenthe dew that lay was gone up, behold, upon the face of the wilderness[there lay] a small round thing, [as] small as the hoar frost on theground. 

{16:15} And when the children of Israel saw [it,] they said oneto another, It [is] manna: for they wist not what it [was.] And Mosessaid unto them, This [is] the bread which the LORD hath given you toeat.   

{16:16} This [is] the thing which the LORD hath commanded, Gather ofit every man [according to] his eating, an omer for every man,according to the number of your persons; take ye every man for [them]which [are] in his tents. 

{16:17} And the children of Israel did so,and gathered, some more, some less. 

{16:18} And when they did mete [it]with an omer, he that gathered much had nothing over, and he thatgathered little had no lack; they gathered every man according to hiseating. 

{16:19} And Moses said, Let no man leave of it till themorning. 

{16:20} Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto Moses; butsome of them left of it until the morning, and it bred worms, andstank: and Moses was wroth with them. 

{16:21} And they gathered itevery morning, every man according to his eating: and when the sunwaxed hot, it melted.   

{16:22} And it came to pass, [that] on the sixth day they gatheredtwice as much bread, two omers for one [man:] and all the rulers of thecongregation came and told Moses. 

{16:23} And he said unto them, This[is that] which the LORD hath said, To morrow [is] the rest of the holysabbath unto the LORD: bake [that] which ye will bake [to day,] andseethe that ye will seethe; and that which remaineth over lay up foryou to be kept until the morning. 

{16:24} And they laid it up till themorning, as Moses bade: and it did not stink, neither was there anyworm therein. 

{16:25} And Moses said, Eat that to day; for to day [is]a sabbath unto the LORD: to day ye shall not find it in the field.

{16:26} Six days ye shall gather it; but on the seventh day, [which is]the sabbath, in it there shall be none.   

{16:27} And it came to pass, [that] there went out [some] of thepeople on the seventh day for to gather, and they found none. 

{16:28}And the LORD said unto Moses, How long refuse ye to keep mycommandments and my laws? 

{16:29} See, for that the LORD hath given youthe sabbath, therefore he giveth you on the sixth day the bread of twodays; abide ye every man in his place, let no man go out of his placeon the seventh day. 

{16:30} So the people rested on the seventh day.

{16:31} And the house of Israel called the name thereof Manna: and it[was] like coriander seed, white; and the taste of it [was] like wafers[made] with honey.   

{16:32} And Moses said, This [is] the thing which the LORDcommandeth, Fill an omer of it to be kept for your generations; thatthey may see the bread wherewith I have fed you in the wilderness, whenI brought you forth from the land of Egypt. 

{16:33} And Moses said untoAaron, Take a pot, and put an omer full of manna therein, and lay it upbefore the LORD, to be kept for your generations. 

{16:34} As the LORDcommanded Moses, so Aaron laid it up before the Testimony, to be kept.

{16:35} And the children of Israel did eat manna forty years, untilthey came to a land inhabited; they did eat manna, until they came untothe borders of the land of Canaan. 

{16:36} Now an omer [is] the tenth[part] of an ephah.   

{17:1} And all the congregation of the children of Israel journeyedfrom the wilderness of Sin, after their journeys, according to thecommandment of the LORD, and pitched in Rephidim: and [there was] nowater for the people to drink. 

{17:2} Wherefore the people did chidewith Moses, and said, Give us water that we may drink. And Moses saidunto them, Why chide ye with me? wherefore do ye tempt the LORD? 

{17:3}And the people thirsted there for water; and the people murmuredagainst Moses, and said, Wherefore [is] this [that] thou hast broughtus up out of Egypt, to kill us and our children and our cattle withthirst? 

{17:4} And Moses cried unto the LORD, saying, What shall I dounto this people? they be almost ready to stone me. 

{17:5} And the LORDsaid unto Moses, Go on before the people, and take with thee of theelders of Israel; and thy rod, wherewith thou smotest the river, takein thine hand, and go. 

{17:6} Behold, I will stand before thee thereupon the rock in Horeb; and thou shalt smite the rock, and there shallcome water out of it, that the people may drink. And Moses did so inthe sight of the elders of Israel. 

{17:7} And he called the name of theplace Massah, and Meribah, because of the chiding of the children ofIsrael, and because they tempted the LORD, saying, Is the LORD amongus, or not?   

{17:8} Then came Amalek, and fought with Israel in Rephidim. 

{17:9}And Moses said unto Joshua, Choose us out men, and go out, fight withAmalek: to morrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the rod ofGod in mine hand. 

{17:10} So Joshua did as Moses had said to him, andfought with Amalek: and Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of thehill. 

{17:11} And it came to pass, when Moses held up his hand, thatIsrael prevailed: and when he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed.

{17:12} But Moses' hands [were] heavy; and they took a stone, and put[it] under him, and he sat thereon; and Aaron and Hur stayed up hishands, the one on the one side, and the other on the other side; andhis hands were steady until the going down of the sun. 

{17:13} AndJoshua discomfited Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword.

{17:14} And the LORD said unto Moses, Write this [for] a memorial in abook, and rehearse [it] in the ears of Joshua: for I will utterly putout the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven. 

{17:15} And Mosesbuilt an altar, and called the name of it Jehovah-nissi: 

{17:16} For hesaid, Because the LORD hath sworn [that] the LORD [will have] war withAmalek from generation to generation.   

{18:1} When Jethro, the priest of Midian, Moses' father in law,heard of all that God had done for Moses, and for Israel his people,[and] that the LORD had brought Israel out of Egypt; 

{18:2} ThenJethro, Moses' father in law, took Zipporah, Moses' wife, after he hadsent her back, 

{18:3} And her two sons; of which the name of the one[was] Gershom; for he said, I have been an alien in a strange land:

{18:4} And the name of the other [was] Eliezer; for the God of myfather, [said he, was] mine help, and delivered me from the sword ofPharaoh: 

{18:5} And Jethro, Moses' father in law, came with his sonsand his wife unto Moses into the wilderness, where he encamped at themount of God: 

{18:6} And he said unto Moses, I thy father in law Jethroam come unto thee, and thy wife, and her two sons with her.   

{18:7} And Moses went out to meet his father in law, and didobeisance, and kissed him; and they asked each other of [their]welfare; and they came into the tent. 

{18:8} And Moses told his fatherin law all that the LORD had done unto Pharaoh and to the Egyptians forIsrael's sake, [and] all the travail that had come upon them by theway, and [how] the LORD delivered them. 

{18:9} And Jethro rejoiced forall the goodness which the LORD had done to Israel, whom he haddelivered out of the hand of the Egyptians. 

{18:10} And Jethro said,Blessed [be] the LORD, who hath delivered you out of the hand of theEgyptians, and out of the hand of Pharaoh, who hath delivered thepeople from under the hand of the Egyptians. 

{18:11} Now I know thatthe LORD [is] greater than all gods: for in the thing wherein theydealt proudly [he was] above them. 

{18:12} And Jethro, Moses' father inlaw, took a burnt offering and sacrifices for God: and Aaron came, andall the elders of Israel, to eat bread with Moses' father in law beforeGod.   

{18:13} And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses sat to judgethe people: and the people stood by Moses from the morning unto theevening. 

{18:14} And when Moses' father in law saw all that he did tothe people, he said, What [is] this thing that thou doest to thepeople? why sittest thou thyself alone, and all the people stand bythee from morning unto even? 

{18:15} And Moses said unto his father inlaw, Because the people come unto me to enquire of God: 

{18:16} Whenthey have a matter, they come unto me; and I judge between one andanother, and I do make [them] know the statutes of God, and his laws.

{18:17} And Moses' father in law said unto him, The thing that thoudoest [is] not good. 

{18:18} Thou wilt surely wear away, both thou, andthis people that [is] with thee: for this thing [is] too heavy forthee; thou art not able to perform it thyself alone. 

{18:19} Hearkennow unto my voice, I will give thee counsel, and God shall be withthee: Be thou for the people to God-ward, that thou mayest bring thecauses unto God: 

{18:20} And thou shalt teach them ordinances and laws,and shalt shew them the way wherein they must walk, and the work thatthey must do. 

{18:21} Moreover thou shalt provide out of all the peopleable men, such as fear God, men of truth, hating covetousness; andplace [such] over them, [to be] rulers of thousands, [and] rulers ofhundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens: 

{18:22} And let themjudge the people at all seasons: and it shall be, [that] every greatmatter they shall bring unto thee, but every small matter they shalljudge: so shall it be easier for thyself, and they shall bear [theburden] with thee. 

{18:23} If thou shalt do this thing, and God commandthee [so,] then thou shalt be able to endure, and all this people shallalso go to their place in peace. 

{18:24} So Moses hearkened to thevoice of his father in law, and did all that he had said. 

{18:25} AndMoses chose able men out of all Israel, and made them heads over thepeople, rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, andrulers of tens. 

{18:26} And they judged the people at all seasons: thehard causes they brought unto Moses, but every small matter they judgedthemselves.   

{18:27} And Moses let his father in law depart; and he went his wayinto his own land.   

{19:1} In the third month, when the children of Israel were goneforth out of the land of Egypt, the same day came they [into] thewilderness of Sinai. 

{19:2} For they were departed from Rephidim, andwere come [to] the desert of Sinai, and had pitched in the wilderness;and there Israel camped before the mount. 

{19:3} And Moses went up untoGod, and the LORD called unto him out of the mountain, saying, Thusshalt thou say to the house of Jacob, and tell the children of Israel;

{19:4} Ye have seen what I did unto the Egyptians, and [how] I bare youon eagles' wings, and brought you unto myself. 

{19:5} Now therefore, ifye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then ye shall be apeculiar treasure unto me above all people: for all the earth [is]mine: 

{19:6} And ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests, and an holynation. These [are] the words which thou shalt speak unto the childrenof Israel.   

{19:7} And Moses came and called for the elders of the people, andlaid before their faces all these words which the LORD commanded him.

{19:8} And all the people answered together, and said, All that theLORD hath spoken we will do. And Moses returned the words of the peopleunto the LORD. 

{19:9} And the LORD said unto Moses, Lo, I come untothee in a thick cloud, that the people may hear when I speak with thee,and believe thee for ever. And Moses told the words of the people untothe LORD.   

{19:10} And the LORD said unto Moses, Go unto the people, andsanctify them to day and to morrow, and let them wash their clothes,

{19:11} And be ready against the third day: for the third day the LORDwill come down in the sight of all the people upon mount Sinai. 

{19:12}And thou shalt set bounds unto the people round about, saying, Takeheed to yourselves, [that ye] go [not] up into the mount, or touch theborder of it: whosoever toucheth the mount shall be surely put todeath: 

{19:13} There shall not an hand touch it, but he shall surely bestoned, or shot through; whether [it be] beast or man, it shall notlive: when the trumpet soundeth long, they shall come up to the mount.   

{19:14} And Moses went down from the mount unto the people, andsanctified the people; and they washed their clothes. 

{19:15} And hesaid unto the people, Be ready against the third day: come not at[your] wives.   

{19:16} And it came to pass on the third day in the morning, thatthere were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud upon the mount,and the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud; so that all the peoplethat [was] in the camp trembled. 

{19:17} And Moses brought forth thepeople out of the camp to meet with God; and they stood at the netherpart of the mount. 

{19:18} And mount Sinai was altogether on a smoke,because the LORD descended upon it in fire: and the smoke thereofascended as the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mount quaked greatly.

{19:19} And when the voice of the trumpet sounded long, and waxedlouder and louder, Moses spake, and God answered him by a voice.

{19:20} And the LORD came down upon mount Sinai, on the top of themount: and the LORD called Moses [up] to the top of the mount; andMoses went up. 

{19:21} And the LORD said unto Moses, Go down, chargethe people, lest they break through unto the LORD to gaze, and many ofthem perish. 

{19:22} And let the priests also, which come near to theLORD, sanctify themselves, lest the LORD break forth upon them. 

{19:23}And Moses said unto the LORD, The people cannot come up to mount Sinai:for thou chargedst us, saying, Set bounds about the mount, and sanctifyit. 

{19:24} And the LORD said unto him, Away, get thee down, and thoushalt come up, thou, and Aaron with thee: but let not the priests andthe people break through to come up unto the LORD, lest he break forthupon them. 

{19:25} So Moses went down unto the people, and spake untothem.   

{20:1} And God spake all these words, saying, 

{20:2} I [am] the LORDthy God, which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of thehouse of bondage. 

{20:3} Thou shalt have no other gods before me.

{20:4} Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness[of any thing] that [is] in heaven above, or that [is] in the earthbeneath, or that [is] in the water under the earth: 

{20:5} Thou shaltnot bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I the LORD thy God[am] a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon thechildren unto the third and fourth [generation] of them that hate me;

{20:6} And shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me, and keepmy commandments. 

{20:7} Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thyGod in vain; for the LORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh hisname in vain. 

{20:8} Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy. 

{20:9}Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work: 

{20:10} But theseventh day [is] the sabbath of the LORD thy God: [in it] thou shaltnot do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant,nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that [is] withinthy gates: 

{20:11} For [in] six days the LORD made heaven and earth,the sea, and all that in them [is,] and rested the seventh day:wherefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.   

{20:12} Honour thy father and thy mother: that thy days may be longupon the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee. 

{20:13} Thou shaltnot kill. 

{20:14} Thou shalt not commit adultery. 

{20:15} Thou shaltnot steal. 

{20:16} Thou shalt not bear false witness against thyneighbour. 

{20:17} Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's house, thoushalt not covet thy neighbour's wife, nor his manservant, nor hismaidservant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any thing that [is] thyneighbour's.   

{20:18} And all the people saw the thunderings, and the lightnings,and the noise of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking: and when thepeople saw [it,] they removed, and stood afar off. 

{20:19} And theysaid unto Moses, Speak thou with us, and we will hear: but let not Godspeak with us, lest we die. 

{20:20} And Moses said unto the people,Fear not: for God is come to prove you, and that his fear may be beforeyour faces, that ye sin not. 

{20:21} And the people stood afar off, andMoses drew near unto the thick darkness where God [was.]   

{20:22} And the LORD said unto Moses, Thus thou shalt say unto thechildren of Israel, Ye have seen that I have talked with you fromheaven. 

{20:23} Ye shall not make with me gods of silver, neither shallye make unto you gods of gold.   

{20:24} An altar of earth thou shalt make unto me, and shaltsacrifice thereon thy burnt offerings, and thy peace offerings, thysheep, and thine oxen: in all places where I record my name I will comeunto thee, and I will bless thee. 

{20:25} And if thou wilt make me analtar of stone, thou shalt not build it of hewn stone: for if thou liftup thy tool upon it, thou hast polluted it. 

{20:26} Neither shalt thougo up by steps unto mine altar, that thy nakedness be not discoveredthereon.   

{21:1} Now these [are] the judgments which thou shalt set beforethem. 

{21:2} If thou buy an Hebrew servant, six years he shall serve:and in the seventh he shall go out free for nothing. 

{21:3} If he camein by himself, he shall go out by himself: if he were married, then hiswife shall go out with him. 

{21:4} If his master have given him a wife,and she have born him sons or daughters; the wife and her childrenshall be her master's, and he shall go out by himself. 

{21:5} And ifthe servant shall plainly say, I love my master, my wife, and mychildren; I will not go out free: 

{21:6} Then his master shall bringhim unto the judges; he shall also bring him to the door, or unto thedoor post; and his master shall bore his ear through with an aul; andhe shall serve him for ever.   

{21:7} And if a man sell his daughter to be a maidservant, she shallnot go out as the menservants do. 

{21:8} If she please not her master,who hath betrothed her to himself, then shall he let her be redeemed:to sell her unto a strange nation he shall have no power, seeing hehath dealt deceitfully with her. 

{21:9} And if he have betrothed herunto his son, he shall deal with her after the manner of daughters.

{21:10} If he take him another [wife;] her food, her raiment, and herduty of marriage, shall he not diminish. 

{21:11} And if he do not thesethree unto her, then shall she go out free without money.   

{21:12} He that smiteth a man, so that he die, shall be surely putto death. 

{21:13} And if a man lie not in wait, but God deliver [him]into his hand; then I will appoint thee a place whither he shall flee.

{21:14} But if a man come presumptuously upon his neighbour, to slayhim with guile; thou shalt take him from mine altar, that he may die.   

{21:15} And he that smiteth his father, or his mother, shall besurely put to death.   

{21:16} And he that stealeth a man, and selleth him, or if he befound in his hand, he shall surely be put to death.   

{21:17} And he that curseth his father, or his mother, shall surelybe put to death.   

{21:18} And if men strive together, and one smite another with astone, or with [his] fist, and he die not, but keepeth [his] bed:

{21:19} If he rise again, and walk abroad upon his staff, then shall hethat smote [him] be quit: only he shall pay [for] the loss of his time,and shall cause [him] to be thoroughly healed.   

{21:20} And if a man smite his servant, or his maid, with a rod, andhe die under his hand; he shall be surely punished. 

{21:21}Notwithstanding, if he continue a day or two, he shall not be punished:for he [is] his money.   

{21:22} If men strive, and hurt a woman with child, so that herfruit depart [from her,] and yet no mischief follow: he shall be surelypunished, according as the woman's husband will lay upon him; and heshall pay as the judges [determine. ]

{21:23} And if [any] mischieffollow, then thou shalt give life for life, 

{21:24} Eye for eye, toothfor tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, 

{21:25} Burning for burning,wound for wound, stripe for stripe.   

{21:26} And if a man smite the eye of his servant, or the eye of hismaid, that it perish; he shall let him go free for his eye's sake.

{21:27} And if he smite out his manservant's tooth, or hismaidservant's tooth; he shall let him go free for his tooth's sake.   

{21:28} If an ox gore a man or a woman, that they die: then the oxshall be surely stoned, and his flesh shall not be eaten; but the ownerof the ox [shall be] quit. 

{21:29} But if the ox were wont to push withhis horn in time past, and it hath been testified to his owner, and hehath not kept him in, but that he hath killed a man or a woman; the oxshall be stoned, and his owner also shall be put to death. 

{21:30} Ifthere be laid on him a sum of money, then he shall give for the ransomof his life whatsoever is laid upon him. 

{21:31} Whether he have goreda son, or have gored a daughter, according to this judgment shall it bedone unto him. 

{21:32} If the ox shall push a manservant or amaidservant; he shall give unto their master thirty shekels of silver,and the ox shall be stoned.   

{21:33} And if a man shall open a pit, or if a man shall dig a pit,and not cover it, and an ox or an ass fall therein; 

{21:34} The ownerof the pit shall make [it] good, [and] give money unto the owner ofthem; and the dead [beast] shall be his.   

{21:35} And if one man's ox hurt another's, that he die; then theyshall sell the live ox, and divide the money of it; and the dead [ox]also they shall divide. 

{21:36} Or if it be known that the ox hath usedto push in time past, and his owner hath not kept him in; he shallsurely pay ox for ox; and the dead shall be his own.   

{22:1} If a man shall steal an ox, or a sheep, and kill it, or sellit; he shall restore five oxen for an ox, and four sheep for a sheep.   

{22:2} If a thief be found breaking up, and be smitten that he die,[there shall] no blood [be shed] for him. 

{22:3} If the sun be risenupon him, [there shall be] blood [shed] for him; [for] he should makefull restitution; if he have nothing, then he shall be sold for histheft. 

{22:4} If the theft be certainly found in his hand alive,whether it be ox, or ass, or sheep; he shall restore double.   

{22:5} If a man shall cause a field or vineyard to be eaten, andshall put in his beast, and shall feed in another man's field; of thebest of his own field, and of the best of his own vineyard, shall hemake restitution.   

{22:6} If fire break out, and catch in thorns, so that the stacks ofcorn, or the standing corn, or the field, be consumed [therewith;] hethat kindled the fire shall surely make restitution.   

{22:7} If a man shall deliver unto his neighbour money or stuff tokeep, and it be stolen out of the man's house; if the thief be found,let him pay double. 

{22:8} If the thief be not found, then the masterof the house shall be brought unto the judges, [to see] whether he haveput his hand unto his neighbour's goods. 

{22:9} For all manner oftrespass, [whether it be] for ox, for ass, for sheep, for raiment, [or]for any manner of lost thing, which [another] challengeth to be his,the cause of both parties shall come before the judges; [and] whom thejudges shall condemn, he shall pay double unto his neighbour. 

{22:10}If a man deliver unto his neighbour an ass, or an ox, or a sheep, orany beast, to keep; and it die, or be hurt, or driven away, no manseeing [it: ]

{22:11} [Then] shall an oath of the LORD be between themboth, that he hath not put his hand unto his neighbour's goods; and theowner of it shall accept [thereof,] and he shall not make [it] good.

{22:12} And if it be stolen from him, he shall make restitution untothe owner thereof. 

{22:13} If it be torn in pieces, [then] let himbring it [for] witness, [and] he shall not make good that which wastorn.   

{22:14} And if a man borrow [ought] of his neighbour, and it behurt, or die, the owner thereof [being] not with it, he shall surelymake [it] good. 

{22:15} [But] if the owner thereof [be] with it, heshall not make [it] good: if it [be] an hired [thing,] it came for hishire.   

{22:16} And if a man entice a maid that is not betrothed, and liewith her, he shall surely endow her to be his wife. 

{22:17} If herfather utterly refuse to give her unto him, he shall pay moneyaccording to the dowry of virgins.   

{22:18} Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.   

{22:19} Whosoever lieth with a beast shall surely be put to death.   

{22:20} He that sacrificeth unto [any] god, save unto the LORD only,he shall be utterly destroyed.   

{22:21} Thou shalt neither vex a stranger, nor oppress him: for yewere strangers in the land of Egypt.   

{22:22} Ye shall not afflict any widow, or fatherless child. 

{22:23}If thou afflict them in any wise, and they cry at all unto me, I willsurely hear their cry; 

{22:24} And my wrath shall wax hot, and I willkill you with the sword; and your wives shall be widows, and yourchildren fatherless.   

{22:25} If thou lend money to [any of] my people [that is] poor bythee, thou shalt not be to him as an usurer, neither shalt thou layupon him usury. 

{22:26} If thou at all take thy neighbour's raiment topledge, thou shalt deliver it unto him by that the sun goeth down:

{22:27} For that [is] his covering only, it [is] his raiment for hisskin: wherein shall he sleep? and it shall come to pass, when he criethunto me, that I will hear; for I [am] gracious.   

{22:28} Thou shalt not revile the gods, nor curse the ruler of thypeople.   

{22:29} Thou shalt not delay [to offer] the first of thy ripefruits, and of thy liquors: the firstborn of thy sons shalt thou giveunto me. 

{22:30} Likewise shalt thou do with thine oxen, [and] with thysheep: seven days it shall be with his dam; on the eighth day thoushalt give it me.   

{22:31} And ye shall be holy men unto me: neither shall ye eat [any]flesh [that is] torn of beasts in the field; ye shall cast it to thedogs.   

{23:1} Thou shalt not raise a false report: put not thine hand withthe wicked to be an unrighteous witness.   

{23:2} Thou shalt not follow a multitude to [do] evil; neither shaltthou speak in a cause to decline after many to wrest [judgment:]   

{23:3} Neither shalt thou countenance a poor man in his cause.   

{23:4} If thou meet thine enemy's ox or his ass going astray, thoushalt surely bring it back to him again. 

{23:5} If thou see the ass ofhim that hateth thee lying under his burden, and wouldest forbear tohelp him, thou shalt surely help with him. 

{23:6} Thou shalt not wrestthe judgment of thy poor in his cause. 

{23:7} Keep thee far from afalse matter; and the innocent and righteous slay thou not: for I willnot justify the wicked.   

{23:8} And thou shalt take no gift: for the gift blindeth the wise,and perverteth the words of the righteous.   

{23:9} Also thou shalt not oppress a stranger: for ye know the heartof a stranger, seeing ye were strangers in the land of Egypt. 

{23:10}And six years thou shalt sow thy land, and shalt gather in the fruitsthereof: 

{23:11} But the seventh [year] thou shalt let it rest and liestill; that the poor of thy people may eat: and what they leave thebeasts of the field shall eat. In like manner thou shalt deal with thyvineyard, [and] with thy oliveyard. 

{23:12} Six days thou shalt do thywork, and on the seventh day thou shalt rest: that thine ox and thineass may rest, and the son of thy handmaid, and the stranger, may berefreshed. 

{23:13} And in all [things] that I have said unto you becircumspect: and make no mention of the name of other gods, neither letit be heard out of thy mouth.   

{23:14} Three times thou shalt keep a feast unto me in the year.

{23:15} Thou shalt keep the feast of unleavened bread: (thou shalt eatunleavened bread seven days, as I commanded thee, in the time appointedof the month Abib; for in it thou camest out from Egypt: and none shallappear before me empty:) 

{23:16} And the feast of harvest, thefirstfruits of thy labours, which thou hast sown in the field: and thefeast of ingathering, [which is] in the end of the year, when thou hastgathered in thy labours out of the field. 

{23:17} Three times in theyear all thy males shall appear before the Lord GOD. 

{23:18} Thou shaltnot offer the blood of my sacrifice with leavened bread; neither shallthe fat of my sacrifice remain until the morning. 

{23:19} The first ofthe firstfruits of thy land thou shalt bring into the house of the LORDthy God. Thou shalt not seethe a kid in his mother's milk.   

{23:20} Behold, I send an Angel before thee, to keep thee in theway, and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared. 

{23:21}Beware of him, and obey his voice, provoke him not; for he will notpardon your transgressions: for my name [is] in him. 

{23:22} But ifthou shalt indeed obey his voice, and do all that I speak; then I willbe an enemy unto thine enemies, and an adversary unto thineadversaries. 

{23:23} For mine Angel shall go before thee, and bringthee in unto the Amorites, and the Hittites, and the Perizzites, andthe Canaanites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites: and I will cut themoff. 

{23:24} Thou shalt not bow down to their gods, nor serve them, nordo after their works: but thou shalt utterly overthrow them, and quitebreak down their images. 

{23:25} And ye shall serve the LORD your God,and he shall bless thy bread, and thy water; and I will take sicknessaway from the midst of thee.   

{23:26} There shall nothing cast their young, nor be barren, in thyland: the number of thy days I will fulfil. 

{23:27} I will send my fearbefore thee, and will destroy all the people to whom thou shalt come,and I will make all thine enemies turn their backs unto thee. 

{23:28}And I will send hornets before thee, which shall drive out the Hivite,the Canaanite, and the Hittite, from before thee. 

{23:29} I will notdrive them out from before thee in one year; lest the land becomedesolate, and the beast of the field multiply against thee. 

{23:30} Bylittle and little I will drive them out from before thee, until thou beincreased, and inherit the land. 

{23:31} And I will set thy bounds fromthe Red sea even unto the sea of the Philistines, and from the desertunto the river: for I will deliver the inhabitants of the land intoyour hand; and thou shalt drive them out before thee. 

{23:32} Thoushalt make no covenant with them, nor with their gods. 

{23:33} Theyshall not dwell in thy land, lest they make thee sin against me: for ifthou serve their gods, it will surely be a snare unto thee.   

{24:1} And he said unto Moses, Come up unto the LORD, thou, andAaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel; andworship ye afar off. 

{24:2} And Moses alone shall come near the LORD:but they shall not come nigh; neither shall the people go up with him.   

{24:3} And Moses came and told the people all the words of the LORD,and all the judgments: and all the people answered with one voice, andsaid, All the words which the LORD hath said will we do. 

{24:4} AndMoses wrote all the words of the LORD, and rose up early in themorning, and builded an altar under the hill, and twelve pillars,according to the twelve tribes of Israel. 

{24:5} And he sent young menof the children of Israel, which offered burnt offerings, andsacrificed peace offerings of oxen unto the LORD. 

{24:6} And Moses tookhalf of the blood, and put [it] in basons; and half of the blood hesprinkled on the altar. 

{24:7} And he took the book of the covenant,and read in the audience of the people: and they said, All that theLORD hath said will we do, and be obedient. 

{24:8} And Moses took theblood, and sprinkled [it] on the people, and said, Behold the blood ofthe covenant, which the LORD hath made with you concerning all thesewords.   

{24:9} Then went up Moses, and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventyof the elders of Israel: 

{24:10} And they saw the God of Israel: and[there was] under his feet as it were a paved work of a sapphire stone,and as it were the body of heaven in [his] clearness. 

{24:11} And uponthe nobles of the children of Israel he laid not his hand: also theysaw God, and did eat and drink.   

{24:12} And the LORD said unto Moses, Come up to me into the mount,and be there: and I will give thee tables of stone, and a law, andcommandments which I have written; that thou mayest teach them. 

{24:13}And Moses rose up, and his minister Joshua: and Moses went up into themount of God. 

{24:14} And he said unto the elders, Tarry ye here forus, until we come again unto you: and, behold, Aaron and Hur [are] withyou: if any man have any matters to do, let him come unto them. 

{24:15}And Moses went up into the mount, and a cloud covered the mount.

{24:16} And the glory of the LORD abode upon mount Sinai, and the cloudcovered it six days: and the seventh day he called unto Moses out ofthe midst of the cloud.

{29:33} And they shall eatthose things wherewith the atonement was made, to consecrate [and] tosanctify them: but a stranger shall not eat [thereof,] because they[are] holy. 

{29:34} And if ought of the flesh of the consecrations, orof the bread, remain unto the morning, then thou shalt burn theremainder with fire: it shall not be eaten, because it [is] holy.

{30:11} And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 

{30:12} When thoutakest the sum of the children of Israel after their number, then shallthey give every man a ransom for his soul unto the LORD, when thounumberest them; that there be no plague among them, when [thou]numberest them. 

{30:13} This they shall give, every one that passethamong them that are numbered, half a shekel after the shekel of thesanctuary: (a shekel [is] twenty gerahs:) an half shekel [shall be] theoffering of the LORD. 

{30:14} Every one that passeth among them thatare numbered, from twenty years old and above, shall give an offeringunto the LORD. 

{30:15} The rich shall not give more, and the poor shallnot give less than half a shekel, when [they] give an offering unto theLORD, to make an atonement for your souls. 

{30:16} And thou shalt takethe atonement money of the children of Israel, and shalt appoint it forthe service of the tabernacle of the congregation; that it may be amemorial unto the children of Israel before the LORD, to make anatonement for your souls.   

{30:17} And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 

{30:18} Thou shaltalso make a laver [of] brass, and his foot [also of] brass, to wash[withal:] and thou shalt put it between the tabernacle of thecongregation and the altar, and thou shalt put water therein. 

{30:19}For Aaron and his sons shall wash their hands and their feet thereat:

{30:20} When they go into the tabernacle of the congregation, theyshall wash with water, that they die not; or when they come near to thealtar to minister, to burn offering made by fire unto the LORD: 

{30:21}So they shall wash their hands and their feet, that they die not: andit shall be a statute for ever to them, [even] to him and to his seedthroughout their generations.   

{30:22} Moreover the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 

{30:23} Takethou also unto thee principal spices, of pure myrrh five hundred[shekels,] and of sweet cinnamon half so much, [even] two hundred andfifty [shekels,] and of sweet calamus two hundred and fifty [shekels,]

{30:25} And thou shalt make it anoil of holy ointment, an ointment compound after the art of theapothecary: it shall be an holy anointing oil. 

{30:26} And thou shaltanoint the tabernacle of the congregation therewith, and the ark of thetestimony, 

{30:27} And the table and all his vessels, and thecandlestick and his vessels, and the altar of incense, 

{30:28} And thealtar of burnt offering with all his vessels, and the laver and hisfoot. 

{30:29} And thou shalt sanctify them, that they may be most holy:whatsoever toucheth them shall be holy. 

{30:30} And thou shalt anointAaron and his sons, and consecrate them, that [they] may minister untome in the priest's office. 

{30:31} And thou shalt speak unto thechildren of Israel, saying, This shall be an holy anointing oil unto methroughout your generations. 

{30:32} Upon man's flesh shall it not bepoured, neither shall ye make [any other] like it, after thecomposition of it: it [is] holy, [and] it shall be holy unto you.

{30:33} Whosoever compoundeth [any] like it, or whosoever putteth [any]of it upon a stranger, shall even be cut off from his people.   

{30:34} And the LORD said unto Moses, Take unto thee sweet spices,stacte, and onycha, and galbanum; [these] sweet spices with purefrankincense: of each shall there be a like [weight: ]

{30:35} And thoushalt make it a perfume, a confection after the art of the apothecary,tempered together, pure [and] holy: 

{30:36} And thou shalt beat [some]of it very small, and put of it before the testimony in the tabernacleof the congregation, where I will meet with thee: it shall be unto youmost holy. 

{30:37} And [as for] the perfume which thou shalt make, yeshall not make to yourselves according to the composition thereof: itshall be unto thee holy for the LORD. 

{30:38} Whosoever shall make likeunto that, to smell thereto, shall even be cut off from his people.   

{31:1} And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 

{31:2} See, I havecalled by name Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe ofJudah: 

{31:3} And I have filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom,and in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner ofworkmanship, 

{31:4} To devise cunning works, to work in gold, and insilver, and in brass, 

{31:5} And in cutting of stones, to set [them,]and in carving of timber, to work in all manner of workmanship. 

{31:6}And I, behold, I have given with him Aholiab, the son of Ahisamach, ofthe tribe of Dan: and in the hearts of all that are wise hearted I haveput wisdom, that they may make all that I have commanded thee; 

{31:7}The tabernacle of the congregation, and the ark of the testimony, andthe mercy seat that [is] thereupon, and all the furniture of thetabernacle, 

{31:8} And the table and his furniture, and the purecandlestick with all his furniture, and the altar of incense, 

{31:9}And the altar of burnt offering with all his furniture, and the laverand his foot, 

{31:10} And the cloths of service, and the holy garmentsfor Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons, to minister in thepriest's office, 

{31:11} And the anointing oil, and sweet incense forthe holy [place:] according to all that I have commanded thee shallthey do.   

{31:12} And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 

{31:13} Speak thoualso unto the children of Israel, saying, Verily my sabbaths ye shallkeep: for it is a sign between me and you throughout your generations;that ye may know that I [am] the LORD that doth sanctify you. 

{31:14}Ye shall keep the sabbath therefore; for it [is] holy unto you: everyone that defileth it shall surely be put to death: for whosoever doeth[any] work therein, that soul shall be cut off from among his people.

{31:15} Six days may work be done; but in the seventh is the sabbath ofrest, holy to the LORD: whosoever doeth [any] work in the sabbath day,he shall surely be put to death. 

{31:16} Wherefore the children ofIsrael shall keep the sabbath, to observe the sabbath throughout theirgenerations, [for] a perpetual covenant. 

{31:17} It [is] a sign betweenme and the children of Israel for ever: for [in] six days the LORD madeheaven and earth, and on the seventh day he rested, and was refreshed.   

{31:18} And he gave unto Moses, when he had made an end of communingwith him upon mount Sinai, two tables of testimony, tables of stone,written with the finger of God.   

{32:1} And when the people saw that Moses delayed to come down outof the mount, the people gathered themselves together unto Aaron, andsaid unto him, Up, make us gods, which shall go before us; for [as for]this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we wotnot what is become of him. 

{32:2} And Aaron said unto them, Break offthe golden earrings, which [are] in the ears of your wives, of yoursons, and of your daughters, and bring [them] unto me. 

{32:3} And allthe people brake off the golden earrings which [were] in their ears,and brought [them] unto Aaron. 

{32:4} And he received [them] at theirhand, and fashioned it with a graving tool, after he had made it amolten calf: and they said, These [be] thy gods, O Israel, whichbrought thee up out of the land of Egypt. 

{32:5} And when Aaron saw[it,] he built an altar before it; and Aaron made proclamation, andsaid, To morrow [is] a feast to the LORD. 

{32:6} And they rose up earlyon the morrow, and offered burnt offerings, and brought peaceofferings; and the people sat down to eat and to drink, and rose up toplay.   

{32:7} And the LORD said unto Moses, Go, get thee down; for thypeople, which thou broughtest out of the land of Egypt, have corrupted[themselves: ]

{32:8} They have turned aside quickly out of the waywhich I commanded them: they have made them a molten calf, and haveworshipped it, and have sacrificed thereunto, and said, These [be] thygods, O Israel, which have brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.

{32:9} And the LORD said unto Moses, I have seen this people, and,behold, it [is] a stiffnecked people: 

{32:10} Now therefore let mealone, that my wrath may wax hot against them, and that I may consumethem: and I will make of thee a great nation. 

{32:11} And Mosesbesought the LORD his God, and said, LORD, why doth thy wrath wax hotagainst thy people, which thou hast brought forth out of the land ofEgypt with great power, and with a mighty hand? 

{32:12} Whereforeshould the Egyptians speak, and say, For mischief did he bring themout, to slay them in the mountains, and to consume them from the faceof the earth? Turn from thy fierce wrath, and repent of this evilagainst thy people. 

{32:13} Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, thyservants, to whom thou swarest by thine own self, and saidst unto them,I will multiply your seed as the stars of heaven, and all this landthat I have spoken of will I give unto your seed, and they shallinherit [it] for ever. 

{32:14} And the LORD repented of the evil whichhe thought to do unto his people.   

{32:15} And Moses turned, and went down from the mount, and the twotables of the testimony [were] in his hand: the tables [were] writtenon both their sides; on the one side and on the other [were] theywritten. 

{32:16} And the tables [were] the work of God, and the writing[was] the writing of God, graven upon the tables. 

{32:17} And whenJoshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted, he said untoMoses, [There is] a noise of war in the camp. 

{32:18} And he said, [Itis] not the voice of [them that] shout for mastery, neither [is it] thevoice of [them that] cry for being overcome: [but] the noise of [themthat] sing do I hear.   

{32:19} And it came to pass, as soon as he came nigh unto the camp,that he saw the calf, and the dancing: and Moses' anger waxed hot, andhe cast the tables out of his hands, and brake them beneath the mount.

{32:20} And he took the calf which they had made, and burnt [it] in thefire, and ground [it] to powder, and strawed [it] upon the water, andmade the children of Israel drink [of it. ]

{32:21} And Moses said untoAaron, What did this people unto thee, that thou hast brought so greata sin upon them? 

{32:22} And Aaron said, Let not the anger of my lordwax hot: thou knowest the people, that they are [set] on mischief.

{32:23} For they said unto me, Make us gods, which shall go before us:for [as for] this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land ofEgypt, we wot not what is become of him. 

{32:24} And I said unto them,Whosoever hath any gold, let them break [it] off. So they gave [it] me:then I cast it into the fire, and there came out this calf.   

{32:25} And when Moses saw that the people [were] naked; (for Aaronhad made them naked unto [their] shame among their enemies:) 

{32:26}Then Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said, Who [is] on theLORD'S side? [let him come] unto me. And all the sons of Levi gatheredthemselves together unto him. 

{32:27} And he said unto them, Thus saiththe LORD God of Israel, Put every man his sword by his side, [and] goin and out from gate to gate throughout the camp, and slay every manhis brother, and every man his companion, and every man his neighbour.

{32:28} And the children of Levi did according to the word of Moses:and there fell of the people that day about three thousand men. 

{32:29}For Moses had said, Consecrate yourselves to day to the LORD, evenevery man upon his son, and upon his brother; that he may bestow uponyou a blessing this day.   

{32:30} And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses said unto thepeople, Ye have sinned a great sin: and now I will go up unto the LORD;peradventure I shall make an atonement for your sin. 

{32:31} And Mosesreturned unto the LORD, and said, Oh, this people have sinned a greatsin, and have made them gods of gold. 

{32:32} Yet now, if thou wiltforgive their sin--; and if not, blot me, I pray thee, out of thy bookwhich thou hast written. 

{32:33} And the LORD said unto Moses,Whosoever hath sinned against me, him will I blot out of my book.

{32:34} Therefore now go, lead the people unto [the place] of which Ihave spoken unto thee: behold, mine Angel shall go before thee:nevertheless in the day when I visit I will visit their sin upon them.

{32:35} And the LORD plagued the people, because they made the calf,which Aaron made.   

{33:1} And the LORD said unto Moses, Depart, [and] go up hence, thouand the people which thou hast brought up out of the land of Egypt,unto the land which I sware unto Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob,saying, Unto thy seed will I give it: 

{33:2} And I will send an angelbefore thee; and I will drive out the Canaanite, the Amorite, and theHittite, and the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite: 

{33:3} Unto aland flowing with milk and honey: for I will not go up in the midst ofthee; for thou [art] a stiffnecked people: lest I consume thee in theway.   

{33:4} And when the people heard these evil tidings, they mourned:and no man did put on him his ornaments. 

{33:5} For the LORD had saidunto Moses, Say unto the children of Israel, Ye [are] a stiffneckedpeople: I will come up into the midst of thee in a moment, and consumethee: therefore now put off thy ornaments from thee, that I may knowwhat to do unto thee. 

{33:6} And the children of Israel strippedthemselves of their ornaments by the mount Horeb. 

{33:7} And Moses tookthe tabernacle, and pitched it without the camp, afar off from thecamp, and called it the Tabernacle of the congregation. And it came topass, [that] every one which sought the LORD went out unto thetabernacle of the congregation, which [was] without the camp. 

{33:8}And it came to pass, when Moses went out unto the tabernacle, [that]all the people rose up, and stood every man [at] his tent door, andlooked after Moses, until he was gone into the tabernacle. 

{33:9} Andit came to pass, as Moses entered into the tabernacle, the cloudypillar descended, and stood [at] the door of the tabernacle, and [the]LORD talked with Moses. 

{33:10} And all the people saw the cloudypillar stand [at] the tabernacle door: and all the people rose up andworshipped, every man [in] his tent door. 

{33:11} And the LORD spakeunto Moses face to face, as a man speaketh unto his friend. And heturned again into the camp: but his servant Joshua, the son of Nun, ayoung man, departed not out of the tabernacle.   

{33:12} And Moses said unto the LORD, See, thou sayest unto me,Bring up this people: and thou hast not let me know whom thou wilt sendwith me. Yet thou hast said, I know thee by name, and thou hast alsofound grace in my sight. 

{33:13} Now therefore, I pray thee, if I havefound grace in thy sight, shew me now thy way, that I may know thee,that I may find grace in thy sight: and consider that this nation [is]thy people. 

{33:14} And he said, My presence shall go [with thee,] andI will give thee rest. 

{33:15} And he said unto him, If thy presence gonot [with me,] carry us not up hence. 

{33:16} For wherein shall it beknown here that I and thy people have found grace in thy sight? [is it]not in that thou goest with us? so shall we be separated, I and thypeople, from all the people that [are] upon the face of the earth.

{33:17} And the LORD said unto Moses, I will do this thing also thatthou hast spoken: for thou hast found grace in my sight, and I knowthee by name. 

{33:18} And he said, I beseech thee, shew me thy glory.

{33:19} And he said, I will make all my goodness pass before thee, andI will proclaim the name of the LORD before thee; and will be graciousto whom I will be gracious, and will shew mercy on whom I will shewmercy. 

{33:20} And he said, Thou canst not see my face: for there shallno man see me, and live. 

{33:21} And the LORD said, Behold, [there is]a place by me, and thou shalt stand upon a rock: 

{33:22} And it shallcome to pass, while my glory passeth by, that I will put thee in aclift of the rock, and will cover thee with my hand while I pass by:

{33:23} And I will take away mine hand, and thou shalt see my backparts: but my face shall not be seen.   

{34:1} And the LORD said unto Moses, Hew thee two tables of stonelike unto the first: and I will write upon [these] tables the wordsthat were in the first tables, which thou brakest. 

{34:2} And be readyin the morning, and come up in the morning unto mount Sinai, andpresent thyself there to me in the top of the mount. 

{34:3} And no manshall come up with thee, neither let any man be seen throughout all themount; neither let the flocks nor herds feed before that mount.   

{34:4} And he hewed two tables of stone like unto the first; andMoses rose up early in the morning, and went up unto mount Sinai, asthe LORD had commanded him, and took in his hand the two tables ofstone. 

{34:5} And the LORD descended in the cloud, and stood with himthere, and proclaimed the name of the LORD. 

{34:6} And the LORD passedby before him, and proclaimed, The LORD, The LORD God, merciful andgracious, longsuffering, and abundant in goodness and truth, 

{34:7}Keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression andsin, and that will by no means clear [the guilty;] visiting theiniquity of the fathers upon the children, and upon the children'schildren, unto the third and to the fourth [generation. ]

{34:8} AndMoses made haste, and bowed his head toward the earth, and worshipped.

{34:9} And he said, If now I have found grace in thy sight, O Lord, letmy Lord, I pray thee, go among us; for it [is] a stiffnecked people;and pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for thine inheritance.   

{34:10} And he said, Behold, I make a covenant: before all thypeople I will do marvels, such as have not been done in all the earth,nor in any nation: and all the people among which thou [art] shall seethe work of the LORD: for it [is] a terrible thing that I will do withthee. 

{34:11} Observe thou that which I command thee this day: behold,I drive out before thee the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and theHittite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite. 

{34:12}Take heed to thyself, lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants ofthe land whither thou goest, lest it be for a snare in the midst ofthee: 

{34:13} But ye shall destroy their altars, break their images,and cut down their groves: 

{34:14} For thou shalt worship no other god:for the LORD, whose name [is] Jealous, [is] a jealous God: 

{34:15} Lestthou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, and they go awhoring after their gods, and do sacrifice unto their gods, and [one]call thee, and thou eat of his sacrifice; 

{34:16} And thou take oftheir daughters unto thy sons, and their daughters go a whoring aftertheir gods, and make thy sons go a whoring after their gods. 

{34:17}Thou shalt make thee no molten gods.   

{34:18} The feast of unleavened bread shalt thou keep. Seven daysthou shalt eat unleavened bread, as I commanded thee, in the time ofthe month Abib: for in the month Abib thou camest out from Egypt.

{34:19} All that openeth the matrix [is] mine; and every firstlingamong thy cattle, [whether] ox or sheep, [that is male. ]

{34:20} Butthe firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb: and if thouredeem [him] not, then shalt thou break his neck. All the firstborn ofthy sons thou shalt redeem. And none shall appear before me empty.   

{34:21} Six days thou shalt work, but on the seventh day thou shaltrest: in earing time and in harvest thou shalt rest.   

{34:22} And thou shalt observe the feast of weeks, of thefirstfruits of wheat harvest, and the feast of ingathering at theyear's end.   

{34:23} Thrice in the year shall all your men children appear beforethe Lord GOD, the God of Israel. 

{34:24} For I will cast out thenations before thee, and enlarge thy borders: neither shall any mandesire thy land, when thou shalt go up to appear before the LORD thyGod thrice in the year. 

{34:25} Thou shalt not offer the blood of mysacrifice with leaven; neither shall the sacrifice of the feast of thepassover be left unto the morning. 

{34:26} The first of the firstfruitsof thy land thou shalt bring unto the house of the LORD thy God. Thoushalt not seethe a kid in his mother's milk. 

{34:27} And the LORD saidunto Moses, Write thou these words: for after the tenor of these wordsI have made a covenant with thee and with Israel. 

{34:28} And he wasthere with the LORD forty days and forty nights; he did neither eatbread, nor drink water. And he wrote upon the tables the words of thecovenant, the ten commandments.   

{34:29} And it came to pass, when Moses came down from mount Sinaiwith the two tables of testimony in Moses' hand, when he came down fromthe mount, that Moses wist not that the skin of his face shone while hetalked with him. 

{34:30} And when Aaron and all the children of Israelsaw Moses, behold, the skin of his face shone; and they were afraid tocome nigh him. 

{34:31} And Moses called unto them; and Aaron and allthe rulers of the congregation returned unto him: and Moses talked withthem. 

{34:32} And afterward all the children of Israel came nigh: andhe gave them in commandment all that the LORD had spoken with him inmount Sinai. 

{34:33} And [till] Moses had done speaking with them, heput a vail on his face. 

{34:34} But when Moses went in before the LORDto speak with him, he took the vail off, until he came out. And he cameout, and spake unto the children of Israel [that] which he wascommanded. 

{34:35} And the children of Israel saw the face of Moses,that the skin of Moses' face shone: and Moses put the vail upon hisface again, until he went in to speak with him.   

{35:1} And Moses gathered all the congregation of the children ofIsrael together, and said unto them, These [are] the words which theLORD hath commanded, that [ye] should do them. 

{35:2} Six days shallwork be done, but on the seventh day there shall be to you an holy day,a sabbath of rest to the LORD: whosoever doeth work therein shall beput to death. 

{35:3} Ye shall kindle no fire throughout yourhabitations upon the sabbath day.   

{35:4} And Moses spake unto all the congregation of the children ofIsrael, saying, This [is] the thing which the LORD commanded, saying,

{35:5} Take ye from among you an offering unto the LORD: whosoever [is]of a willing heart, let him bring it, an offering of the LORD; gold,and silver, and brass, 

{35:6} And blue, and purple, and scarlet, andfine linen, and goats' [hair, ]

{35:7} And rams' skins dyed red, andbadgers' skins, and shittim wood, 

{35:8} And oil for the light, andspices for anointing oil, and for the sweet incense, 

{35:9} And onyxstones, and stones to be set for the ephod, and for the breastplate.

{35:10} And every wise hearted among you shall come, and make all thatthe LORD hath commanded; 

{35:11} The tabernacle, his tent, and hiscovering, his taches, and his boards, his bars, his pillars, and hissockets, 

{35:12} The ark, and the staves thereof, [with] the mercyseat, and the vail of the covering, 

{35:13} The table, and his staves,and all his vessels, and the shewbread, 

{35:14} The candlestick alsofor the light, and his furniture, and his lamps, with the oil for thelight, 

{35:15} And the incense altar, and his staves, and the anointingoil, and the sweet incense, and the hanging for the door at theentering in of the tabernacle, 

{35:16} The altar of burnt offering,with his brasen grate, his staves, and all his vessels, the laver andhis foot, 

{35:17} The hangings of the court, his pillars, and theirsockets, and the hanging for the door of the court, 

{35:18} The pins ofthe tabernacle, and the pins of the court, and their cords, 

{35:19} Thecloths of service, to do service in the holy [place,] the holy garmentsfor Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons, to minister in thepriest's office.   

{35:20} And all the congregation of the children of Israel departedfrom the presence of Moses. 

{35:21} And they came, every one whoseheart stirred him up, and every one whom his spirit made willing, [and]they brought the LORD'S offering to the work of the tabernacle of thecongregation, and for all his service, and for the holy garments.

{35:22} And they came, both men and women, as many as were willinghearted, [and] brought bracelets, and earrings, and rings, and tablets,all jewels of gold: and every man that offered [offered] an offering ofgold unto the LORD. 

{35:23} And every man, with whom was found blue,and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats' [hair,] and redskins of rams, and badgers' skins, brought [them. ]

{35:24} Every onethat did offer an offering of silver and brass brought the LORD'Soffering: and every man, with whom was found shittim wood for any workof the service, brought [it. ]

{35:25} And all the women that were wisehearted did spin with their hands, and brought that which they hadspun, [both] of blue, and of purple, [and] of scarlet, and of finelinen. 

{35:26} And all the women whose heart stirred them up in wisdomspun goats' [hair. ]

{35:27} And the rulers brought onyx stones, andstones to be set, for the ephod, and for the breastplate; 

{35:28} Andspice, and oil for the light, and for the anointing oil, and for thesweet incense. 

{35:29} The children of Israel brought a willingoffering unto the LORD, every man and woman, whose heart made themwilling to bring for all manner of work, which the LORD had commandedto be made by the hand of Moses.   

{35:30} And Moses said unto the children of Israel, See, the LORDhath called by name Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of thetribe of Judah; 

{35:31} And he hath filled him with the spirit of God,in wisdom, in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner ofworkmanship; 

{35:32} And to devise curious works, to work in gold, andin silver, and in brass, 

{35:33} And in the cutting of stones, to set[them,] and in carving of wood, to make any manner of cunning work.

{35:34} And he hath put in his heart that he may teach, [both] he, andAholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan. 

{35:35} Them hathhe filled with wisdom of heart, to work all manner of work, of theengraver, and of the cunning workman, and of the embroiderer, in blue,and in purple, in scarlet, and in fine linen, and of the weaver, [even]of them that do any work, and of those that devise cunning work.   

{36:1} Then wrought Bezaleel and Aholiab, and every wise heartedman, in whom the LORD put wisdom and understanding to know how to workall manner of work for the service of the sanctuary, according to allthat the LORD had commanded. 

{36:2} And Moses called Bezaleel andAholiab, and every wise hearted man, in whose heart the LORD had putwisdom, [even] every one whose heart stirred him up to come unto thework to do it: 

{36:3} And they received of Moses all the offering,which the children of Israel had brought for the work of the service ofthe sanctuary, to make it [withal.] And they brought yet unto him freeofferings every morning. 

{36:4} And all the wise men, that wrought allthe work of the sanctuary, came every man from his work which they made;   

{36:5} And they spake unto Moses, saying, The people bring much morethan enough for the service of the work, which the LORD commanded tomake. 

{36:6} And Moses gave commandment, and they caused it to beproclaimed throughout the camp, saying, Let neither man nor woman makeany more work for the offering of the sanctuary. So the people wererestrained from bringing. 

{36:7} For the stuff they had was sufficientfor all the work to make it, and too much.   

{36:8} And every wise hearted man among them that wrought the workof the tabernacle made ten curtains [of] fine twined linen, and blue,and purple, and scarlet: [with] cherubims of cunning work made he them.

{36:9} The length of one curtain [was] twenty and eight cubits, and thebreadth of one curtain four cubits: the curtains [were] all of onesize. 

{36:10} And he coupled the five curtains one unto another: and[the other] five curtains he coupled one unto another. 

{36:11} And hemade loops of blue on the edge of one curtain from the selvedge in thecoupling: likewise he made in the uttermost side of [another] curtain,in the coupling of the second. 

{36:12} Fifty loops made he in onecurtain, and fifty loops made he in the edge of the curtain which [was]in the coupling of the second: the loops held one [curtain] to another.

{36:13} And he made fifty taches of gold, and coupled the curtains oneunto another with the taches: so it became one tabernacle.   

{36:14} And he made curtains [of] goats' [hair] for the tent overthe tabernacle: eleven curtains he made them. 

{36:15} The length of onecurtain [was] thirty cubits, and four cubits [was] the breadth of onecurtain: the eleven curtains [were] of one size. 

{36:16} And he coupledfive curtains by themselves, and six curtains by themselves. 

{36:17}And he made fifty loops upon the uttermost edge of the curtain in thecoupling, and fifty loops made he upon the edge of the curtain whichcoupleth the second. 

{36:18} And he made fifty taches [of] brass tocouple the tent together, that it might be one. 

{36:19} And he made acovering for the tent [of] rams' skins dyed red, and a covering [of]badgers' skins above [that.]   

{36:20} And he made boards for the tabernacle [of] shittim wood,standing up. 

{36:21} The length of a board [was] ten cubits, and thebreadth of a board one cubit and a half. 

{36:22} One board had twotenons, equally distant one from another: thus did he make for all theboards of the tabernacle. 

{36:23} And he made boards for thetabernacle; twenty boards for the south side southward: 

{36:24} Andforty sockets of silver he made under the twenty boards; two socketsunder one board for his two tenons, and two sockets under another boardfor his two tenons. 

{36:25} And for the other side of the tabernacle,[which is] toward the north corner, he made twenty boards, 

{36:26} Andtheir forty sockets of silver; two sockets under one board, and twosockets under another board. 

{36:27} And for the sides of thetabernacle westward he made six boards. 

{36:28} And two boards made hefor the corners of the tabernacle in the two sides. 

{36:29} And theywere coupled beneath, and coupled together at the head thereof, to onering: thus he did to both of them in both the corners. 

{36:30} Andthere were eight boards; and their sockets [were] sixteen sockets ofsilver, under every board two sockets.   

{36:31} And he made bars of shittim wood; five for the boards of theone side of the tabernacle, 

{36:32} And five bars for the boards of theother side of the tabernacle, and five bars for the boards of thetabernacle for the sides westward. 

{36:33} And he made the middle barto shoot through the boards from the one end to the other. 

{36:34} Andhe overlaid the boards with gold, and made their rings [of] gold [tobe] places for the bars, and overlaid the bars with gold.   

{36:35} And he made a vail [of] blue, and purple, and scarlet, andfine twined linen: [with] cherubims made he it of cunning work. 

{36:36}And he made thereunto four pillars [of] shittim [wood,] and overlaidthem with gold: their hooks [were of] gold; and he cast for them foursockets of silver.   

{36:37} And he made an hanging for the tabernacle door [of] blue,and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen, of needlework; 

{36:38}And the five pillars of it with their hooks: and he overlaid theirchapiters and their fillets with gold: but their five sockets [were of]brass.   

{37:1} And Bezaleel made the ark [of] shittim wood: two cubits and ahalf [was] the length of it, and a cubit and a half the breadth of it,and a cubit and a half the height of it: 

{37:2} And he overlaid it withpure gold within and without, and made a crown of gold to it roundabout. 

{37:3} And he cast for it four rings of gold, [to be set] by thefour corners of it; even two rings upon the one side of it, and tworings upon the other side of it. 

{37:4} And he made staves [of] shittimwood, and overlaid them with gold. 

{37:5} And he put the staves intothe rings by the sides of the ark, to bear the ark.   

{37:6} And he made the mercy seat [of] pure gold: two cubits and ahalf [was] the length thereof, and one cubit and a half the breadththereof. 

{37:7} And he made two cherubims [of] gold, beaten out of onepiece made he them, on the two ends of the mercy seat; 

{37:8} Onecherub on the end on this side, and another cherub on the [other] endon that side: out of the mercy seat made he the cherubims on the twoends thereof. 

{37:9} And the cherubims spread out [their] wings onhigh, [and] covered with their wings over the mercy seat, with theirfaces one to another; [even ]to the mercy seatward were the faces ofthe cherubims.   

{37:10} And he made the table of shittim wood: two cubits [was] thelength thereof, and a cubit the breadth thereof, and a cubit and a halfthe height thereof: 

{37:11} And he overlaid it with pure gold, and madethereunto a crown of gold round about. 

{37:12} Also he made thereunto aborder of an handbreadth round about; and made a crown of gold for theborder thereof round about. 

{37:13} And he cast for it four rings ofgold, and put the rings upon the four corners that [were] in the fourfeet thereof. 

{37:14} Over against the border were the rings, theplaces for the staves to bear the table. 

{37:15} And he made the staves[of] shittim wood, and overlaid them with gold, to bear the table.

{37:16} And he made the vessels which [were] upon the table, hisdishes, and his spoons, and his bowls, and his covers to cover withal,[of] pure gold.   

{37:17} And he made the candlestick [of] pure gold: [of] beaten workmade he the candlestick; his shaft, and his branch, his bowls, hisknops, and his flowers, were of the same: 

{37:18} And six branchesgoing out of the sides thereof; three branches of the candlestick outof the one side thereof, and three branches of the candlestick out ofthe other side thereof: 

{37:19} Three bowls made after the fashion ofalmonds in one branch, a knop and a flower; and three bowls made likealmonds in another branch, a knop and a flower: so throughout the sixbranches going out of the candlestick. 

{37:20} And in the candlestick[were] four bowls made like almonds, his knops, and his flowers:

{37:21} And a knop under two branches of the same, and a knop under twobranches of the same, and a knop under two branches of the same,according to the six branches going out of it. 

{37:22} Their knops andtheir branches were of the same: all of it [was] one beaten work [of]pure gold. 

{37:23} And he made his seven lamps, and his snuffers, andhis snuffdishes, [of] pure gold.

{37:26} And he overlaid it with pure gold, [both] thetop of it, and the sides thereof round about, and the horns of it: alsohe made unto it a crown of gold round about.

{37:28} And he made the staves [of] shittim wood, and overlaidthem with gold.   

{37:29} And he made the holy anointing oil, and the pure incense ofsweet spices, according to the work of the apothecary.   

{38:1} And he made the altar of burnt offering [of] shittim wood:five cubits [was] the length thereof, and five cubits the breadththereof; [it was] foursquare; and three cubits the height thereof.

{38:2} And he made the horns thereof on the four corners of it; thehorns thereof were of the same: and he overlaid it with brass. 

{38:3}And he made all the vessels of the altar, the pots, and the shovels,and the basons, [and] the fleshhooks, and the firepans: all the vesselsthereof made he [of] brass. 

{38:4} And he made for the altar a brasengrate of network under the compass thereof beneath unto the midst ofit. 

{38:5} And he cast four rings for the four ends of the grate ofbrass, [to be] places for the staves. 

{38:6} And he made the staves[of] shittim wood, and overlaid them with brass. 

{38:7} And he put thestaves into the rings on the sides of the altar, to bear it withal; hemade the altar hollow with boards.   

{38:8} And he made the laver [of] brass, and the foot of it [of]brass, of the lookingglasses of [the women] assembling, which assembled[at] the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.   

{38:9} And he made the court: on the south side southward thehangings of the court [were of] fine twined linen, an hundred cubits:

{38:10} Their pillars [were] twenty, and their brasen sockets twenty;the hooks of the pillars and their fillets [were of] silver. 

{38:11}And for the north side [the hangings were] an hundred cubits, theirpillars [were] twenty, and their sockets of brass twenty; the hooks ofthe pillars and their fillets [of] silver. 

{38:12} And for the westside [were] hangings of fifty cubits, their pillars ten, and theirsockets ten; the hooks of the pillars and their fillets [of] silver.

{38:13} And for the east side eastward fifty cubits. 

{38:14} Thehangings of the one side [of the gate were] fifteen cubits; theirpillars three, and their sockets three. 

{38:15} And for the other sideof the court gate, on this hand and that hand, [were] hangings offifteen cubits; their pillars three, and their sockets three. 

{38:16}All the hangings of the court round about [were] of fine twined linen.

{38:17} And the sockets for the pillars [were of] brass; the hooks ofthe pillars and their fillets [of] silver; and the overlaying of theirchapiters [of] silver; and all the pillars of the court [were] filletedwith silver. 

{38:18} And the hanging for the gate of the court [was]needlework, [of] blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen:and twenty cubits [was] the length, and the height in the breadth [was]five cubits, answerable to the hangings of the court. 

{38:19} And theirpillars [were] four, and their sockets [of] brass four; their hooks[of] silver, and the overlaying of their chapiters and their fillets[of] silver. 

{38:20} And all the pins of the tabernacle, and of thecourt round about, [were of] brass.   

{38:21} This is the sum of the tabernacle, [even] of the tabernacleof testimony, as it was counted, according to the commandment of Moses,[for] the service of the Levites, by the hand of Ithamar, son to Aaronthe priest. 

{38:22} And Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of thetribe of Judah, made all that the LORD commanded Moses. 

{38:23} Andwith him [was] Aholiab, son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan, anengraver, and a cunning workman, and an embroiderer in blue, and inpurple, and in scarlet, and fine linen. 

{38:24} All the gold that wasoccupied for the work in all the work of the holy [place,] even thegold of the offering, was twenty and nine talents, and seven hundredand thirty shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary. 

{38:25} And thesilver of them that were numbered of the congregation [was] an hundredtalents, and a thousand seven hundred and threescore and fifteenshekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary: 

{38:26} A bekah for everyman, [that is,] half a shekel, after the shekel of the sanctuary, forevery one that went to be numbered, from twenty years old and upward,for six hundred thousand and three thousand and five hundred and fifty[men. ]

{38:27} And of the hundred talents of silver were cast thesockets of the sanctuary, and the sockets of the vail; an hundredsockets of the hundred talents, a talent for a socket. 

{38:28} And ofthe thousand seven hundred seventy and five [shekels] he made hooks forthe pillars, and overlaid their chapiters, and filleted them. 

{38:29}And the brass of the offering [was] seventy talents, and two thousandand four hundred shekels. 

{38:30} And therewith he made the sockets tothe door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and the brasen altar,and the brasen grate for it, and all the vessels of the altar, 

{38:31}And the sockets of the court round about, and the sockets of the courtgate, and all the pins of the tabernacle, and all the pins of the courtround about.   

{39:1} And of the blue, and purple, and scarlet, they made cloths ofservice, to do service in the holy [place,] and made the holy garmentsfor Aaron; as the LORD commanded Moses. 

{39:2} And he made the ephod[of] gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen. 

{39:3}And they did beat the gold into thin plates, and cut [it into] wires,to work [it] in the blue, and in the purple, and in the scarlet, and inthe fine linen, [with] cunning work. 

{39:4} They made shoulderpiecesfor it, to couple [it] together: by the two edges was it coupledtogether. 

{39:5} And the curious girdle of his ephod, that [was] uponit, [was] of the same, according to the work thereof; [of] gold, blue,and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen; as the LORD commandedMoses.   

{39:6} And they wrought onyx stones inclosed in ouches of gold,graven, as signets are graven, with the names of the children ofIsrael. 

{39:7} And he put them on the shoulders of the ephod, [thatthey should be] stones for a memorial to the children of Israel; as theLORD commanded Moses.   

{39:8} And he made the breastplate [of] cunning work, like the workof the ephod; [of] gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twinedlinen. 

{39:9} It was foursquare; they made the breastplate double: aspan [was] the length thereof, and a span the breadth thereof, [being]doubled. 

{39:10} And they set in it four rows of stones: [the first]row [was] a sardius, a topaz, and a carbuncle: this [was] the firstrow. 

{39:11} And the second row, an emerald, a sapphire, and a diamond.

{39:12} And the third row, a ligure, an agate, and an amethyst. 

{39:13}And the fourth row, a beryl, an onyx, and a jasper: [they were]inclosed in ouches of gold in their inclosings. 

{39:14} And the stones[were] according to the names of the children of Israel, twelve,according to their names, [like] the engravings of a signet, every onewith his name, according to the twelve tribes. 

{39:15} And they madeupon the breastplate chains at the ends, [of] wreathen work [of] puregold. 

{39:16} And they made two ouches [of] gold, and two gold rings;and put the two rings in the two ends of the breastplate. 

{39:17} Andthey put the two wreathen chains of gold in the two rings on the endsof the breastplate. 

{39:18} And the two ends of the two wreathen chainsthey fastened in the two ouches, and put them on the shoulderpieces ofthe ephod, before it. 

{39:19} And they made two rings of gold, and put[them] on the two ends of the breastplate, upon the border of it, which[was] on the side of the ephod inward. 

{39:20} And they made two[other] golden rings, and put them on the two sides of the ephodunderneath, toward the forepart of it, over against the [other]coupling thereof, above the curious girdle of the ephod. 

{39:21} Andthey did bind the breastplate by his rings unto the rings of the ephodwith a lace of blue, that it might be above the curious girdle of theephod, and that the breastplate might not be loosed from the ephod; asthe LORD commanded Moses.   

{39:22} And he made the robe of the ephod [of] woven work, all [of]blue. 

{39:23} And [there was] an hole in the midst of the robe, as thehole of an habergeon, [with] a band round about the hole, that itshould not rend. 

{39:24} And they made upon the hems of the robepomegranates [of] blue, and purple, and scarlet, [and] twined [linen.]

{39:25} And they made bells [of] pure gold, and put the bells betweenthe pomegranates upon the hem of the robe, round about between thepomegranates; 

{39:26} A bell and a pomegranate, a bell and apomegranate, round about the hem of the robe to minister [in;] as theLORD commanded Moses.   

{39:27} And they made coats [of] fine linen [of] woven work forAaron, and for his sons, 

{39:28} And a mitre [of] fine linen, andgoodly bonnets [of] fine linen, and linen breeches [of] fine twinedlinen, 

{39:29} And a girdle [of] fine twined linen, and blue, andpurple, and scarlet, [of] needlework; as the LORD commanded Moses.   

{39:30} And they made the plate of the holy crown [of] pure gold,and wrote upon it a writing, [like to] the engravings of a signet,HOLINESS TO THE LORD. 

{39:31} And they tied unto it a lace of blue, tofasten [it] on high upon the mitre; as the LORD commanded Moses.   

{39:32} Thus was all the work of the tabernacle of the tent of thecongregation finished: and the children of Israel did according to allthat the LORD commanded Moses, so did they.   

{39:33} And they brought the tabernacle unto Moses, the tent, andall his furniture, his taches, his boards, his bars, and his pillars,and his sockets, 

{39:34} And the covering of rams' skins dyed red, andthe covering of badgers' skins, and the vail of the covering, 

{39:35}The ark of the testimony, and the staves thereof, and the mercy seat,

{39:36} The table, [and] all the vessels thereof, and the shewbread,

{39:37} The pure candlestick, [with] the lamps thereof, [even with] thelamps to be set in order, and all the vessels thereof, and the oil forlight, 

{39:38} And the golden altar, and the anointing oil, and thesweet incense, and the hanging for the tabernacle door, 

{39:39} Thebrasen altar, and his grate of brass, his staves, and all his vessels,the laver and his foot, 

{39:40} The hangings of the court, his pillars,and his sockets, and the hanging for the court gate, his cords, and hispins, and all the vessels of the service of the tabernacle, for thetent of the congregation, 

{39:41} The cloths of service to do servicein the holy [place,] and the holy garments for Aaron the priest, andhis sons' garments, to minister in the priest's office. 

{39:42}According to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so the children ofIsrael made all the work. 

{39:43} And Moses did look upon all the work,and, behold, they have done it as the LORD had commanded, even so hadthey done it: and Moses blessed them.   

{40:1} And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 

{40:2} On the firstday of the first month shalt thou set up the tabernacle of the tent ofthe congregation. 

{40:3} And thou shalt put therein the ark of thetestimony, and cover the ark with the vail. 

{40:4} And thou shalt bringin the table, and set in order the things that are to be set in orderupon it; and thou shalt bring in the candlestick, and light the lampsthereof. 

{40:5} And thou shalt set the altar of gold for the incensebefore the ark of the testimony, and put the hanging of the door to thetabernacle. 

{40:6} And thou shalt set the altar of the burnt offeringbefore the door of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation.

{40:7} And thou shalt set the laver between the tent of thecongregation and the altar, and shalt put water therein. 

{40:8} Andthou shalt set up the court round about, and hang up the hanging at thecourt gate. 

{40:9} And thou shalt take the anointing oil, and anointthe tabernacle, and all that [is] therein, and shalt hallow it, and allthe vessels thereof: and it shall be holy. 

{40:10} And thou shaltanoint the altar of the burnt offering, and all his vessels, andsanctify the altar: and it shall be an altar most holy. 

{40:11} Andthou shalt anoint the laver and his foot, and sanctify it. 

{40:12} Andthou shalt bring Aaron and his sons unto the door of the tabernacle ofthe congregation, and wash them with water. 

{40:13} And thou shalt putupon Aaron the holy garments, and anoint him, and sanctify him; that hemay minister unto me in the priest's office. 

{40:14} And thou shaltbring his sons, and clothe them with coats: 

{40:15} And thou shaltanoint them, as thou didst anoint their father, that they may ministerunto me in the priest's office: for their anointing shall surely be aneverlasting priesthood throughout their generations. 

{40:16} Thus didMoses: according to all that the LORD commanded him, so did he.   

{40:17} And it came to pass in the first month in the second year,on the first [day] of the month, [that] the tabernacle was reared up.

{40:18} And Moses reared up the tabernacle, and fastened his sockets,and set up the boards thereof, and put in the bars thereof, and rearedup his pillars. 

{40:19} And he spread abroad the tent over thetabernacle, and put the covering of the tent above upon it; as the LORDcommanded Moses.   

{40:20} And he took and put the testimony into the ark, and set thestaves on the ark, and put the mercy seat above upon the ark: 

{40:21}And he brought the ark into the tabernacle, and set up the vail of thecovering, and covered the ark of the testimony; as the LORD commandedMoses.   

{40:22} And he put the table in the tent of the congregation, uponthe side of the tabernacle northward, without the vail. 

{40:23} And heset the bread in order upon it before the LORD; as the LORD hadcommanded Moses.   

{40:24} And he put the candlestick in the tent of the congregation,over against the table, on the side of the tabernacle southward.

{40:25} And he lighted the lamps before the LORD; as the LORD commandedMoses.   

{40:26} And he put the golden altar in the tent of the congregationbefore the vail: 

{40:27} And he burnt sweet incense thereon; as theLORD commanded Moses.   

{40:28} And he set up the hanging [at] the door of the tabernacle.

{40:29} And he put the altar of burnt offering [by] the door of thetabernacle of the tent of the congregation, and offered upon it theburnt offering and the meat offering; as the LORD commanded Moses.   

{40:30} And he set the laver between the tent of the congregationand the altar, and put water there, to wash [withal. ]

{40:31} And Mosesand Aaron and his sons washed their hands and their feet thereat:

{40:32} When they went into the tent of the congregation, and when theycame near unto the altar, they washed; as the LORD commanded Moses.

{40:33} And he reared up the court round about the tabernacle and thealtar, and set up the hanging of the court gate. So Moses finished thework.   

{40:34} Then a cloud covered the tent of the congregation, and theglory of the LORD filled the tabernacle. 

{40:35} And Moses was not ableto enter into the tent of the congregation, because the cloud abodethereon, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle. 

{40:36} Andwhen the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle, the children ofIsrael went onward in all their journeys: 

{40:37} But if the cloud werenot taken up, then they journeyed not till the day that it was takenup. 

{40:38} For the cloud of the LORD [was] upon the tabernacle by day,and fire was on it by night, in the sight of all the house of Israel,throughout all their journeys.
