{The Gospel According to St. Luke   

{1:1} Forasmuch as many have taken in hand to set forth in order adeclaration of those things which are most surely believed among us,

{1:2} Even as they delivered them unto us, which from the beginningwere eyewitnesses, and ministers of the word; 

{1:3} It seemed good tome also, having had perfect understanding of all things from the veryfirst, to write unto thee in order, most excellent Theophilus, 

{1:4}That thou mightest know the certainty of those things, wherein thouhast been instructed.   

{1:5} There was in the days of Herod, the king of Judaea, a certainpriest named Zacharias, of the course of Abia: and his wife [was] ofthe daughters of Aaron, and her name [was] Elisabeth. 

{1:6} And theywere both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments andordinances of the Lord blameless. 

{1:7} And they had no child, becausethat Elisabeth was barren, and they both were [now] well stricken inyears. 

{1:8} And it came to pass, that while he executed the priest'soffice before God in the order of his course, 

{1:9} According to thecustom of the priest's office, his lot was to burn incense when he wentinto the temple of the Lord. 

{1:10} And the whole multitude of thepeople were praying without at the time of incense. 

{1:11} And thereappeared unto him an angel of the Lord standing on the right side ofthe altar of incense. 

{1:12} And when Zacharias saw [him,] he wastroubled, and fear fell upon him. 

{1:13} But the angel said unto him,Fear not, Zacharias: for thy prayer is heard; and thy wife Elisabethshall bear thee a son, and thou shalt call his name John. 

{1:14} Andthou shalt have joy and gladness; and many shall rejoice at his birth.

{1:15} For he shall be great in the sight of the Lord, and shall drinkneither wine nor strong drink; and he shall be filled with the HolyGhost, even from his mother's womb. 

{1:16} And many of the children ofIsrael shall he turn to the Lord their God. 

{1:17} And he shall gobefore him in the spirit and power of Elias, to turn the hearts of thefathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just;to make ready a people prepared for the Lord. 

{1:18} And Zacharias saidunto the angel, Whereby shall I know this? for I am an old man, and mywife well stricken in years. 

{1:19} And the angel answering said untohim, I am Gabriel, that stand in the presence of God; and am sent tospeak unto thee, and to shew thee these glad tidings. 

{1:20} And,behold, thou shalt be dumb, and not able to speak, until the day thatthese things shall be performed, because thou believest not my words,which shall be fulfilled in their season. 

{1:21} And the people waitedfor Zacharias, and marvelled that he tarried so long in the temple.

{1:22} And when he came out, he could not speak unto them: and theyperceived that he had seen a vision in the temple: for he beckoned untothem, and remained speechless. 

{1:23} And it came to pass, that, assoon as the days of his ministration were accomplished, he departed tohis own house. 

{1:24} And after those days his wife Elisabethconceived, and hid herself five months, saying, 

{1:25} Thus hath theLord dealt with me in the days wherein he looked on [me,] to take awaymy reproach among men. 

{1:26} And in the sixth month the angel Gabrielwas sent from God unto a city of Galilee, named Nazareth, 

{1:27} To avirgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David;and the virgin's name [was] Mary. 

{1:28} And the angel came in untoher, and said, Hail, [thou that art] highly favoured, the Lord [is]with thee: blessed [art] thou among women. 

{1:29} And when she saw[him,] she was troubled at his saying, and cast in her mind what mannerof salutation this should be. 

{1:30} And the angel said unto her, Fearnot, Mary: for thou hast found favour with God. 

{1:31} And, behold,thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt callhis name JESUS. 

{1:32} He shall be great, and shall be called the Sonof the Highest: and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of hisfather David: 

{1:33} And he shall reign over the house of Jacob forever; and of his kingdom there shall be no end. 

{1:34} Then said Maryunto the angel, How shall this be, seeing I know not a man? 

{1:35} Andthe angel answered and said unto her, The Holy Ghost shall come uponthee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee: thereforealso that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called theSon of God. 

{1:36} And, behold, thy cousin Elisabeth, she hath alsoconceived a son in her old age: and this is the sixth month with her,who was called barren. 

{1:37} For with God nothing shall be impossible.

{1:38} And Mary said, Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto meaccording to thy word. And the angel departed from her. 

{1:39} And Maryarose in those days, and went into the hill country with haste, into acity of Juda; 

{1:40} And entered into the house of Zacharias, andsaluted Elisabeth. 

{1:41} And it came to pass, that, when Elisabethheard the salutation of Mary, the babe leaped in her womb; andElisabeth was filled with the Holy Ghost: 

{1:42} And she spake out witha loud voice, and said, Blessed [art] thou among women, and blessed[is] the fruit of thy womb. 

{1:43} And whence [is] this to me, that themother of my Lord should come to me? 

{1:44} For, lo, as soon as thevoice of thy salutation sounded in mine ears, the babe leaped in mywomb for joy. 

{1:45} And blessed [is] she that believed: for thereshall be a performance of those things which were told her from theLord. 

{1:46} And Mary said, My soul doth magnify the Lord, 

{1:47} Andmy spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour. 

{1:48} For he hath regardedthe low estate of his handmaiden: for, behold, from henceforth allgenerations shall call me blessed. 

{1:49} For he that is mighty hathdone to me great things; and holy [is] his name. 

{1:50} And his mercy[is] on them that fear him from generation to generation. 

{1:51} Hehath shewed strength with his arm; he hath scattered the proud in theimagination of their hearts. 

{1:52} He hath put down the mighty from[their] seats, and exalted them of low degree. 

{1:53} He hath filledthe hungry with good things; and the rich he hath sent empty away.

{1:54} He hath holpen his servant Israel, in remembrance of [his]mercy; 

{1:55} As he spake to our fathers, to Abraham, and to his seedfor ever. 

{1:56} And Mary abode with her about three months, andreturned to her own house. 

{1:57} Now Elisabeth's full time came thatshe should be delivered; and she brought forth a son. 

{1:58} And herneighbours and her cousins heard how the Lord had shewed great mercyupon her; and they rejoiced with her. 

{1:59} And it came to pass, thaton the eighth day they came to circumcise the child; and they calledhim Zacharias, after the name of his father. 

{1:60} And his motheranswered and said, Not [so;] but he shall be called John. 

{1:61} Andthey said unto her, There is none of thy kindred that is called by thisname. 

{1:62} And they made signs to his father, how he would have himcalled. 

{1:63} And he asked for a writing table, and wrote, saying, Hisname is John. And they marvelled all. 

{1:64} And his mouth was openedimmediately, and his tongue [loosed,] and he spake, and praised God.

{1:65} And fear came on all that dwelt round about them: and all thesesayings were noised abroad throughout all the hill country of Judaea.

{1:66} And all they that heard [them] laid [them] up in their hearts,saying, What manner of child shall this be! And the hand of the Lordwas with him. 

{1:67} And his father Zacharias was filled with the HolyGhost, and prophesied, saying, 

{1:68} Blessed [be] the Lord God ofIsrael; for he hath visited and redeemed his people, 

{1:69} And hathraised up an horn of salvation for us in the house of his servantDavid; 

{1:70} As he spake by the mouth of his holy prophets, which havebeen since the world began: 

{1:71} That we should be saved from ourenemies, and from the hand of all that hate us; 

{1:72} To perform themercy [promised] to our fathers, and to remember his holy covenant;

{1:73} The oath which he sware to our father Abraham, 

{1:74} That hewould grant unto us, that we being delivered out of the hand of ourenemies might serve him without fear, 

{1:75} In holiness andrighteousness before him, all the days of our life. 

{1:76} And thou,child, shalt be called the prophet of the Highest: for thou shalt gobefore the face of the Lord to prepare his ways; 

{1:77} To giveknowledge of salvation unto his people by the remission of their sins,

{1:78} Through the tender mercy of our God; whereby the dayspring fromon high hath visited us, 

{1:79} To give light to them that sit indarkness and [in] the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the wayof peace. 

{1:80} And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, andwas in the deserts till the day of his shewing unto Israel.   

{2:1} And it came to pass in those days, that there went out adecree from Caesar Augustus, that all the world should be taxed. 

{2:2}([And] this taxing was first made when Cyrenius was governor of Syria.)

{2:3} And all went to be taxed, every one into his own city. 

{2:4} AndJoseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, intoJudaea, unto the city of David, which is called Bethlehem; (because hewas of the house and lineage of David:) 

{2:5} To be taxed with Mary hisespoused wife, being great with child. 

{2:6} And so it was, that, whilethey were there, the days were accomplished that she should bedelivered. 

{2:7} And she brought forth her firstborn son, and wrappedhim in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger; because there wasno room for them in the inn. 

{2:8} And there were in the same countryshepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch over their flock bynight. 

{2:9} And, lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and theglory of the Lord shone round about them: and they were sore afraid.

{2:10} And the angel said unto them, Fear not: for, behold, I bring yougood tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people. 

{2:11} Forunto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour, which isChrist the Lord. 

{2:12} And this [shall be] a sign unto you; Ye shallfind the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger. 

{2:13}And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly hostpraising God, and saying, 

{2:14} Glory to God in the highest, and onearth peace, good will toward men. 

{2:15} And it came to pass, as theangels were gone away from them into heaven, the shepherds said one toanother, Let us now go even unto Bethlehem, and see this thing which iscome to pass, which the Lord hath made known unto us. 

{2:16} And theycame with haste, and found Mary, and Joseph, and the babe lying in amanger. 

{2:17} And when they had seen [it,] they made known abroad thesaying which was told them concerning this child. 

{2:18} And all theythat heard [it] wondered at those things which were told them by theshepherds. 

{2:19} But Mary kept all these things, and pondered [them]in her heart. 

{2:20} And the shepherds returned, glorifying andpraising God for all the things that they had heard and seen, as it wastold unto them. 

{2:21} And when eight days were accomplished for thecircumcising of the child, his name was called JESUS, which was sonamed of the angel before he was conceived in the womb. 

{2:22} And whenthe days of her purification according to the law of Moses wereaccomplished, they brought him to Jerusalem, to present [him] to theLord; 

{2:23} (As it is written in the law of the Lord, Every male thatopeneth the womb shall be called holy to the Lord;) 

{2:24} And to offera sacrifice according to that which is said in the law of the Lord, Apair of turtledoves, or two young pigeons. 

{2:25} And, behold, therewas a man in Jerusalem, whose name [was] Simeon; and the same man [was]just and devout, waiting for the consolation of Israel: and the HolyGhost was upon him. 

{2:26} And it was revealed unto him by the HolyGhost, that he should not see death, before he had seen the Lord'sChrist. 

{2:27} And he came by the Spirit into the temple: and when theparents brought in the child Jesus, to do for him after the custom ofthe law, 

{2:28} Then took he him up in his arms, and blessed God, andsaid, 

{2:29} Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace,according to thy word: 

{2:30} For mine eyes have seen thy salvation,

{2:31} Which thou hast prepared before the face of all people; 

{2:32} Alight to lighten the Gentiles, and the glory of thy people Israel.

{2:33} And Joseph and his mother marvelled at those things which werespoken of him. 

{2:34} And Simeon blessed them, and said unto Mary hismother, Behold, this [child] is set for the fall and rising again ofmany in Israel; and for a sign which shall be spoken against; 

{2:35}(Yea, a sword shall pierce through thy own soul also,) that thethoughts of many hearts may be revealed. 

{2:36} And there was one Anna,a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Aser: she was ofa great age, and had lived with an husband seven years from hervirginity; 

{2:37} And she [was] a widow of about fourscore and fouryears, which departed not from the temple, but served [God] withfastings and prayers night and day. 

{2:38} And she coming in thatinstant gave thanks likewise unto the Lord, and spake of him to allthem that looked for redemption in Jerusalem. 

{2:39} And when they hadperformed all things according to the law of the Lord, they returnedinto Galilee, to their own city Nazareth. 

{2:40} And the child grew,and waxed strong in spirit, filled with wisdom: and the grace of Godwas upon him. 

{2:41} Now his parents went to Jerusalem every year atthe feast of the passover. 

{2:42} And when he was twelve years old,they went up to Jerusalem after the custom of the feast. 

{2:43} Andwhen they had fulfilled the days, as they returned, the child Jesustarried behind in Jerusalem; and Joseph and his mother knew not [of it.]

{2:44} But they, supposing him to have been in the company, went aday's journey; and they sought him among [their] kinsfolk andacquaintance. 

{2:45} And when they found him not, they turned backagain to Jerusalem, seeking him. 

{2:46} And it came to pass, that afterthree days they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of thedoctors, both hearing them, and asking them questions. 

{2:47} And allthat heard him were astonished at his understanding and answers. 

{2:48}And when they saw him, they were amazed: and his mother said unto him,Son, why hast thou thus dealt with us? behold, thy father and I havesought thee sorrowing. 

{2:49} And he said unto them, How is it that yesought me? wist ye not that I must be about my Father's business?

{2:50} And they understood not the saying which he spake unto them.

{2:51} And he went down with them, and came to Nazareth, and wassubject unto them: but his mother kept all these sayings in her heart.

{2:52} And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favour withGod and man.   

{3:1} Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar,Pontius Pilate being governor of Judaea, and Herod being tetrarch ofGalilee, and his brother Philip tetrarch of Ituraea and of the regionof Trachonitis, and Lysanias the tetrarch of Abilene, 

{3:2} Annas andCaiaphas being the high priests, the word of God came unto John the sonof Zacharias in the wilderness. 

{3:3} And he came into all the countryabout Jordan, preaching the baptism of repentance for the remission ofsins; 

{3:4} As it is written in the book of the words of Esaias theprophet, saying, The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare yethe way of the Lord, make his paths straight. 

{3:5} Every valley shallbe filled, and every mountain and hill shall be brought low; and thecrooked shall be made straight, and the rough ways [shall be] madesmooth; 

{3:6} And all flesh shall see the salvation of God. 

{3:7} Thensaid he to the multitude that came forth to be baptized of him, Ogeneration of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath tocome? 

{3:8} Bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance, andbegin not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to [our] father:for I say unto you, That God is able of these stones to raise upchildren unto Abraham. 

{3:9} And now also the axe is laid unto the rootof the trees: every tree therefore which bringeth not forth good fruitis hewn down, and cast into the fire. 

{3:10} And the people asked him,saying, What shall we do then? 

{3:11} He answereth and saith unto them,He that hath two coats, let him impart to him that hath none; and hethat hath meat, let him do likewise. 

{3:12} Then came also publicans tobe baptized, and said unto him, Master, what shall we do? 

{3:13} And hesaid unto them, Exact no more than that which is appointed you. 

{3:14}And the soldiers likewise demanded of him, saying, And what shall wedo? And he said unto them, Do violence to no man, neither accuse [any]falsely; and be content with your wages. 

{3:15} And as the people werein expectation, and all men mused in their hearts of John, whether hewere the Christ, or not; 

{3:16} John answered, saying unto [them] all,I indeed baptize you with water; but one mightier than I cometh, thelatchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to unloose: he shall baptize youwith the Holy Ghost and with fire: 

{3:17} Whose fan [is] in his hand,and he will throughly purge his floor, and will gather the wheat intohis garner; but the chaff he will burn with fire unquenchable. 

{3:18}And many other things in his exhortation preached he unto the people.

{3:19} But Herod the tetrarch, being reproved by him for Herodias hisbrother Philip's wife, and for all the evils which Herod had done,

{3:20} Added yet this above all, that he shut up John in prison. 

{3:21}Now when all the people were baptized, it came to pass, that Jesus alsobeing baptized, and praying, the heaven was opened, 

{3:22} And the HolyGhost descended in a bodily shape like a dove upon him, and a voicecame from heaven, which said, Thou art my beloved Son; in thee I amwell pleased. 

{3:23} And Jesus himself began to be about thirty yearsof age, being (as was supposed) the son of Joseph, which was [the son]of Heli, 

{3:24} Which was [the son] of Matthat, which was [the son] ofLevi, which was [the son] of Melchi, which was [the son] of Janna,which was [the son] of Joseph, 

{3:25} Which was [the son] ofMattathias, which was [the son] of Amos, which was [the son] of Naum,which was [the son] of Esli, which was [the son] of Nagge, 

{3:26} Whichwas [the son] of Maath, which was [the son] of Mattathias, which was[the son] of Semei, which was [the son] of Joseph, which was [the son]of Juda, 

{3:27} Which was [the son] of Joanna, which was [the son] ofRhesa, which was [the son] of Zorobabel, which was [the son] ofSalathiel, which was [the son] of Neri, 

{3:28} Which was [the son] ofMelchi, which was [the son] of Addi, which was [the son] of Cosam,which was [the son] of Elmodam, which was [the son] of Er, 

{3:29} Whichwas [the son] of Jose, which was [the son] of Eliezer, which was [theson] of Jorim, which was [the son] of Matthat, which was [the son] ofLevi, 

{3:30} Which was [the son] of Simeon, which was [the son] ofJuda, which was [the son] of Joseph, which was [the son] of Jonan,which was [the son] of Eliakim, 

{3:31} Which was [the son] of Melea,which was [the son] of Menan, which was [the son] of Mattatha, whichwas [the son] of Nathan, which was [the son] of David, 

{3:32} Which was[the son] of Jesse, which was [the son] of Obed, which was [the son] ofBooz, which was [the son] of Salmon, which was [the son] of Naasson,

{3:33} Which was [the son] of Aminadab, which was [the son] of Aram,which was [the son] of Esrom, which was [the son] of Phares, which was[the son] of Juda, 

{3:34} Which was [the son] of Jacob, which was [theson] of Isaac, which was [the son] of Abraham, which was [the son] ofThara, which was [the son] of Nachor, 

{3:35} Which was [the son] ofSaruch, which was [the son] of Ragau, which was [the son] of Phalec,which was [the son] of Heber, which was [the son] of Sala, 

{3:36} Whichwas [the son] of Cainan, which was [the son] of Arphaxad, which was[the son] of Sem, which was [the son] of Noe, which was [the son] ofLamech, 

{3:37} Which was [the son] of Mathusala, which was [the son] ofEnoch, which was [the son] of Jared, which was [the son] of Maleleel,which was [the son] of Cainan, 

{3:38} Which was [the son] of Enos,which was [the son] of Seth, which was [the son] of Adam, which was[the son] of God.   

{4:1} And Jesus being full of the Holy Ghost returned from Jordan,and was led by the Spirit into the wilderness, 

{4:2} Being forty daystempted of the devil. And in those days he did eat nothing: and whenthey were ended, he afterward hungered. 

{4:3} And the devil said untohim, If thou be the Son of God, command this stone that it be madebread. 

{4:4} And Jesus answered him, saying, It is written, That manshall not live by bread alone, but by every word of God. 

{4:5} And thedevil, taking him up into an high mountain, shewed unto him all thekingdoms of the world in a moment of time. 

{4:6} And the devil saidunto him, All this power will I give thee, and the glory of them: forthat is delivered unto me; and to whomsoever I will I give it. 

{4:7} Ifthou therefore wilt worship me, all shall be thine. 

{4:8} And Jesusanswered and said unto him, Get thee behind me, Satan: for it iswritten, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thouserve. 

{4:9} And he brought him to Jerusalem, and set him on a pinnacleof the temple, and said unto him, If thou be the Son of God, castthyself down from hence: 

{4:10} For it is written, He shall give hisangels charge over thee, to keep thee: 

{4:11} And in [their] hands theyshall bear thee up, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against astone. 

{4:12} And Jesus answering said unto him, It is said, Thou shaltnot tempt the Lord thy God. 

{4:13} And when the devil had ended all thetemptation, he departed from him for a season.   

{4:14} And Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit into Galilee:and there went out a fame of him through all the region round about.

{4:15} And he taught in their synagogues, being glorified of all.   

{4:16} And he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up: and,as his custom was, he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, andstood up for to read. 

{4:17} And there was delivered unto him the bookof the prophet Esaias. And when he had opened the book, he found theplace where it was written, 

{4:18} The Spirit of the Lord is upon me,because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor; he hathsent me to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to thecaptives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty themthat are bruised, 

{4:19} To preach the acceptable year of the Lord.

{4:20} And he closed the book, and he gave [it] again to the minister,and sat down. And the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue werefastened on him. 

{4:21} And he began to say unto them, This day is thisscripture fulfilled in your ears. 

{4:22} And all bare him witness, andwondered at the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth. Andthey said, Is not this Joseph's son? 

{4:23} And he said unto them, Yewill surely say unto me this proverb, Physician, heal thyself:whatsoever we have heard done in Capernaum, do also here in thycountry. 

{4:24} And he said, Verily I say unto you, No prophet isaccepted in his own country. 

{4:25} But I tell you of a truth, manywidows were in Israel in the days of Elias, when the heaven was shut upthree years and six months, when great famine was throughout all theland; 

{4:26} But unto none of them was Elias sent, save unto Sarepta,[a city] of Sidon, unto a woman [that was] a widow. 

{4:27} And manylepers were in Israel in the time of Eliseus the prophet; and none ofthem was cleansed, saving Naaman the Syrian. 

{4:28} And all they in thesynagogue, when they heard these things, were filled with wrath, 

{4:29}And rose up, and thrust him out of the city, and led him unto the browof the hill whereon their city was built, that they might cast him downheadlong. 

{4:30} But he passing through the midst of them went his way,

{4:31} And came down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee, and taught themon the sabbath days. 

{4:32} And they were astonished at his doctrine:for his word was with power.   

{4:33} And in the synagogue there was a man, which had a spirit ofan unclean devil, and cried out with a loud voice, 

{4:34} Saying, Let[us] alone; what have we to do with thee, [thou] Jesus of Nazareth? artthou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art; the Holy One of God.

{4:35} And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out ofhim. And when the devil had thrown him in the midst, he came out ofhim, and hurt him not. 

{4:36} And they were all amazed, and spake amongthemselves, saying, What a word [is] this! for with authority and powerhe commandeth the unclean spirits, and they come out. 

{4:37} And thefame of him went out into every place of the country round about.   

{4:38} And he arose out of the synagogue, and entered into Simon'shouse. And Simon's wife's mother was taken with a great fever; and theybesought him for her. 

{4:39} And he stood over her, and rebuked thefever; and it left her: and immediately she arose and ministered untothem.   

{4:40} Now when the sun was setting, all they that had any sick withdivers diseases brought them unto him; and he laid his hands on everyone of them, and healed them. 

{4:41} And devils also came out of many,crying out, and saying, Thou art Christ the Son of God. And he rebuking[them] suffered them not to speak: for they knew that he was Christ.

{4:42} And when it was day, he departed and went into a desert place:and the people sought him, and came unto him, and stayed him, that heshould not depart from them. 

{4:43} And he said unto them, I mustpreach the kingdom of God to other cities also: for therefore am Isent. 

{4:44} And he preached in the synagogues of Galilee.   

{5:1} And it came to pass, that, as the people pressed upon him tohear the word of God, he stood by the lake of Gennesaret, 

{5:2} And sawtwo ships standing by the lake: but the fishermen were gone out ofthem, and were washing [their] nets. 

{5:3} And he entered into one ofthe ships, which was Simon's, and prayed him that he would thrust out alittle from the land. And he sat down, and taught the people out of theship. 

{5:4} Now when he had left speaking, he said unto Simon, Launchout into the deep, and let down your nets for a draught. 

{5:5} AndSimon answering said unto him, Master, we have toiled all the night,and have taken nothing: nevertheless at thy word I will let down thenet. 

{5:6} And when they had this done, they inclosed a great multitudeof fishes: and their net brake. 

{5:7} And they beckoned unto [their]partners, which were in the other ship, that they should come and helpthem. And they came, and filled both the ships, so that they began tosink. 

{5:8} When Simon Peter saw [it,] he fell down at Jesus' knees,saying, Depart from me; for I am a sinful man, O Lord. 

{5:9} For he wasastonished, and all that were with him, at the draught of the fisheswhich they had taken: 

{5:10} And so [was] also James, and John, thesons of Zebedee, which were partners with Simon. And Jesus said untoSimon, Fear not; from henceforth thou shalt catch men. 

{5:11} And whenthey had brought their ships to land, they forsook all, and followedhim.   

{5:12} And it came to pass, when he was in a certain city, behold aman full of leprosy: who seeing Jesus fell on [his] face, and besoughthim, saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean. 

{5:13} Andhe put forth [his] hand, and touched him, saying, I will: be thouclean. And immediately the leprosy departed from him. 

{5:14} And hecharged him to tell no man: but go, and shew thyself to the priest, andoffer for thy cleansing, according as Moses commanded, for a testimonyunto them. 

{5:15} But so much the more went there a fame abroad of him:and great multitudes came together to hear, and to be healed by him oftheir infirmities.   

{5:16} And he withdrew himself into the wilderness, and prayed.

{5:17} And it came to pass on a certain day, as he was teaching, thatthere were Pharisees and doctors of the law sitting by, which were comeout of every town of Galilee, and Judaea, and Jerusalem: and the powerof the Lord was [present] to heal them.   

{5:18} And, behold, men brought in a bed a man which was taken witha palsy: and they sought [means] to bring him in, and to lay [him]before him. 

{5:19} And when they could not find by what [way] theymight bring him in because of the multitude, they went upon thehousetop, and let him down through the tiling with [his] couch into themidst before Jesus. 

{5:20} And when he saw their faith, he said untohim, Man, thy sins are forgiven thee. 

{5:21} And the scribes and thePharisees began to reason, saying, Who is this which speakethblasphemies? Who can forgive sins, but God alone? 

{5:22} But when Jesusperceived their thoughts, he answering said unto them, What reason yein your hearts? 

{5:23} Whether is easier, to say, Thy sins be forgiventhee; or to say, Rise up and walk? 

{5:24} But that ye may know that theSon of man hath power upon earth to forgive sins, (he said unto thesick of the palsy,) I say unto thee, Arise, and take up thy couch, andgo into thine house. 

{5:25} And immediately he rose up before them, andtook up that whereon he lay, and departed to his own house, glorifyingGod. 

{5:26} And they were all amazed, and they glorified God, and werefilled with fear, saying, We have seen strange things to day.   

{5:27} And after these things he went forth, and saw a publican,named Levi, sitting at the receipt of custom: and he said unto him,Follow me. 

{5:28} And he left all, rose up, and followed him. 

{5:29}And Levi made him a great feast in his own house: and there was a greatcompany of publicans and of others that sat down with them. 

{5:30} Buttheir scribes and Pharisees murmured against his disciples, saying, Whydo ye eat and drink with publicans and sinners? 

{5:31} And Jesusanswering said unto them, They that are whole need not a physician; butthey that are sick. 

{5:32} I came not to call the righteous, butsinners to repentance.   

{5:33} And they said unto him, Why do the disciples of John fastoften, and make prayers, and likewise [the disciples] of the Pharisees;but thine eat and drink? 

{5:34} And he said unto them, Can ye make thechildren of the bridechamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them?

{5:35} But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken awayfrom them, and then shall they fast in those days.   

{5:36} And he spake also a parable unto them; No man putteth a pieceof a new garment upon an old; if otherwise, then both the new maketh arent, and the piece that was [taken] out of the new agreeth not withthe old. 

{5:37} And no man putteth new wine into old bottles; else thenew wine will burst the bottles, and be spilled, and the bottles shallperish. 

{5:38} But new wine must be put into new bottles; and both arepreserved. 

{5:39} No man also having drunk old [wine] straightwaydesireth new: for he saith, The old is better.   

{6:1} And it came to pass on the second sabbath after the first,that he went through the corn fields; and his disciples plucked theears of corn, and did eat, rubbing [them] in [their] hands. 

{6:2} Andcertain of the Pharisees said unto them, Why do ye that which is notlawful to do on the sabbath days? 

{6:3} And Jesus answering them said,Have ye not read so much as this, what David did, when himself was anhungred, and they which were with him; 

{6:4} How he went into the houseof God, and did take and eat the shewbread, and gave also to them thatwere with him; which it is not lawful to eat but for the priests alone?

{6:5} And he said unto them, That the Son of man is Lord also of thesabbath. 

{6:6} And it came to pass also on another sabbath, that heentered into the synagogue and taught: and there was a man whose righthand was withered. 

{6:7} And the scribes and Pharisees watched him,whether he would heal on the sabbath day; that they might find anaccusation against him. 

{6:8} But he knew their thoughts, and said tothe man which had the withered hand, Rise up, and stand forth in themidst. And he arose and stood forth. 

{6:9} Then said Jesus unto them, Iwill ask you one thing; Is it lawful on the sabbath days to do good, orto do evil? to save life, or to destroy [it? ]

{6:10} And looking roundabout upon them all, he said unto the man, Stretch forth thy hand. Andhe did so: and his hand was restored whole as the other. 

{6:11} Andthey were filled with madness; and communed one with another what theymight do to Jesus. 

{6:12} And it came to pass in those days, that hewent out into a mountain to pray, and continued all night in prayer toGod.   

{6:13} And when it was day, he called [unto him] his disciples: andof them he chose twelve, whom also he named apostles; 

{6:14} Simon,(whom he also named Peter,) and Andrew his brother, James and John,Philip and Bartholomew, 

{6:15} Matthew and Thomas, James the [son] ofAlphaeus, and Simon called Zelotes, 

{6:16} And Judas [the brother] ofJames, and Judas Iscariot, which also was the traitor.   

{6:17} And he came down with them, and stood in the plain, and thecompany of his disciples, and a great multitude of people out of allJudaea and Jerusalem, and from the sea coast of Tyre and Sidon, whichcame to hear him, and to be healed of their diseases; 

{6:18} And theythat were vexed with unclean spirits: and they were healed. 

{6:19} Andthe whole multitude sought to touch him: for there went virtue out ofhim, and healed [them] all.   

{6:20} And he lifted up his eyes on his disciples, and said, Blessed[be ye] poor: for yours is the kingdom of God. 

{6:21} Blessed [are ye]that hunger now: for ye shall be filled. Blessed [are ye] that weepnow: for ye shall laugh. 

{6:22} Blessed are ye, when men shall hateyou, and when they shall separate you [from their company,] and shallreproach [you,] and cast out your name as evil, for the Son of man'ssake. 

{6:23} Rejoice ye in that day, and leap for joy: for, behold,your reward [is] great in heaven: for in the like manner did theirfathers unto the prophets. 

{6:24} But woe unto you that are rich! forye have received your consolation. 

{6:25} Woe unto you that are full!for ye shall hunger. Woe unto you that laugh now! for ye shall mournand weep. 

{6:26} Woe unto you, when all men shall speak well of you!for so did their fathers to the false prophets.   

{6:27} But I say unto you which hear, Love your enemies, do good tothem which hate you, 

{6:28} Bless them that curse you, and pray forthem which despitefully use you. 

{6:29} And unto him that smiteth theeon the [one] cheek offer also the other; and him that taketh away thycloke forbid not [to take thy] coat also. 

{6:30} Give to every man thatasketh of thee; and of him that taketh away thy goods ask [them] notagain. 

{6:31} And as ye would that men should do to you, do ye also tothem likewise. 

{6:32} For if ye love them which love you, what thankhave ye? for sinners also love those that love them. 

{6:33} And if yedo good to them which do good to you, what thank have ye? for sinnersalso do even the same. 

{6:34} And if ye lend [to them] of whom ye hopeto receive, what thank have ye? for sinners also lend to sinners, toreceive as much again. 

{6:35} But love ye your enemies, and do good,and lend, hoping for nothing again; and your reward shall be great, andye shall be the children of the Highest: for he is kind unto theunthankful and [to] the evil. 

{6:36} Be ye therefore merciful, as yourFather also is merciful. 

{6:37} Judge not, and ye shall not be judged:condemn not, and ye shall not be condemned: forgive, and ye shall beforgiven: 

{6:38} Give, and it shall be given unto you; good measure,pressed down, and shaken together, and running over, shall men giveinto your bosom. For with the same measure that ye mete withal it shallbe measured to you again. 

{6:39} And he spake a parable unto them, Canthe blind lead the blind? shall they not both fall into the ditch?

{6:40} The disciple is not above his master: but every one that isperfect shall be as his master. 

{6:41} And why beholdest thou the motethat is in thy brother's eye, but perceivest not the beam that is inthine own eye? 

{6:42} Either how canst thou say to thy brother,Brother, let me pull out the mote that is in thine eye, when thouthyself beholdest not the beam that is in thine own eye? Thouhypocrite, cast out first the beam out of thine own eye, and then shaltthou see clearly to pull out the mote that is in thy brother's eye.

{6:43} For a good tree bringeth not forth corrupt fruit; neither doth acorrupt tree bring forth good fruit. 

{6:44} For every tree is known byhis own fruit. For of thorns men do not gather figs, nor of a bramblebush gather they grapes. 

{6:45} A good man out of the good treasure ofhis heart bringeth forth that which is good; and an evil man out of theevil treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is evil: for ofthe abundance of the heart his mouth speaketh.   

{6:46} And why call ye me, Lord, Lord, and do not the things which Isay? 

{6:47} Whosoever cometh to me, and heareth my sayings, and doeththem, I will shew you to whom he is like: 

{6:48} He is like a man whichbuilt an house, and digged deep, and laid the foundation on a rock: andwhen the flood arose, the stream beat vehemently upon that house, andcould not shake it: for it was founded upon a rock. 

{6:49} But he thatheareth, and doeth not, is like a man that without a foundation builtan house upon the earth; against which the stream did beat vehemently,and immediately it fell; and the ruin of that house was great.   

{7:1} Now when he had ended all his sayings in the audience of thepeople, he entered into Capernaum. 

{7:2} And a certain centurion'sservant, who was dear unto him, was sick, and ready to die. 

{7:3} Andwhen he heard of Jesus, he sent unto him the elders of the Jews,beseeching him that he would come and heal his servant. 

{7:4} And whenthey came to Jesus, they besought him instantly, saying, That he wasworthy for whom he should do this: 

{7:5} For he loveth our nation, andhe hath built us a synagogue. 

{7:6} Then Jesus went with them. And whenhe was now not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to him,saying unto him, Lord, trouble not thyself: for I am not worthy thatthou shouldest enter under my roof: 

{7:7} Wherefore neither thought Imyself worthy to come unto thee: but say in a word, and my servantshall be healed. 

{7:8} For I also am a man set under authority, havingunder me soldiers, and I say unto one, Go, and he goeth; and toanother, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth[it. ]

{7:9} When Jesus heard these things, he marvelled at him, andturned him about, and said unto the people that followed him, I sayunto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel. 

{7:10}And they that were sent, returning to the house, found the servantwhole that had been sick.   

{7:11} And it came to pass the day after, that he went into a citycalled Nain; and many of his disciples went with him, and much people.

{7:12} Now when he came nigh to the gate of the city, behold, there wasa dead man carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was awidow: and much people of the city was with her. 

{7:13} And when theLord saw her, he had compassion on her, and said unto her, Weep not.

{7:14} And he came and touched the bier: and they that bare [him] stoodstill. And he said, Young man, I say unto thee, Arise. 

{7:15} And hethat was dead sat up, and began to speak. And he delivered him to hismother. 

{7:16} And there came a fear on all: and they glorified God,saying, That a great prophet is risen up among us; and, That God hathvisited his people. 

{7:17} And this rumour of him went forth throughoutall Judaea, and throughout all the region round about. 

{7:18} And thedisciples of John shewed him of all these things.   

{7:19} And John calling [unto him] two of his disciples sent [them]to Jesus, saying, Art thou he that should come? or look we for another?

{7:20} When the men were come unto him, they said, John Baptist hathsent us unto thee, saying, Art thou he that should come? or look we foranother? 

{7:21} And in that same hour he cured many of [their]infirmities and plagues, and of evil spirits; and unto many [that were]blind he gave sight. 

{7:22} Then Jesus answering said unto them, Goyour way, and tell John what things ye have seen and heard; how thatthe blind see, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear,the dead are raised, to the poor the gospel is preached. 

{7:23} Andblessed is [he,] whosoever shall not be offended in me.   

{7:24} And when the messengers of John were departed, he began tospeak unto the people concerning John, What went ye out into thewilderness for to see? A reed shaken with the wind? 

{7:25} But whatwent ye out for to see? A man clothed in soft raiment? Behold, theywhich are gorgeously apparelled, and live delicately, are in kingscourts. 

{7:26} But what went ye out for to see? A prophet? Yea, I sayunto you, and much more than a prophet. 

{7:27} This is [he,] of whom itis written, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shallprepare thy way before thee. 

{7:28} For I say unto you, Among thosethat are born of women there is not a greater prophet than John theBaptist: but he that is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.

{7:29} And all the people that heard [him,] and the publicans,justified God, being baptized with the baptism of John. 

{7:30} But thePharisees and lawyers rejected the counsel of God against themselves,being not baptized of him.   

{7:31} And the Lord said, Whereunto then shall I liken the men ofthis generation? and to what are they like? 

{7:32} They are like untochildren sitting in the marketplace, and calling one to another, andsaying, We have piped unto you, and ye have not danced; we have mournedto you, and ye have not wept. 

{7:33} For John the Baptist came neithereating bread nor drinking wine; and ye say, He hath a devil. 

{7:34} TheSon of man is come eating and drinking; and ye say, Behold a gluttonousman, and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners! 

{7:35} Butwisdom is justified of all her children.   

{7:36} And one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat withhim. And he went into the Pharisee's house, and sat down to meat.

{7:37} And, behold, a woman in the city, which was a sinner, when sheknew that [Jesus] sat at meat in the Pharisee's house, brought analabaster box of ointment, 

{7:38} And stood at his feet behind [him]weeping, and began to wash his feet with tears, and did wipe [them]with the hairs of her head, and kissed his feet, and anointed [them]with the ointment. 

{7:39} Now when the Pharisee which had bidden himsaw [it,] he spake within himself, saying, This man, if he were aprophet, would have known who and what manner of woman [this is] thattoucheth him: for she is a sinner. 

{7:40} And Jesus answering said untohim, Simon, I have somewhat to say unto thee. And he saith, Master, sayon. 

{7:41} There was a certain creditor which had two debtors: the oneowed five hundred pence, and the other fifty. 

{7:42} And when they hadnothing to pay, he frankly forgave them both. Tell me therefore, whichof them will love him most? 

{7:43} Simon answered and said, I supposethat [he,] to whom he forgave most. And he said unto him, Thou hastrightly judged. 

{7:44} And he turned to the woman, and said unto Simon,Seest thou this woman? I entered into thine house, thou gavest me nowater for my feet: but she hath washed my feet with tears, and wiped[them] with the hairs of her head. 

{7:45} Thou gavest me no kiss: butthis woman since the time I came in hath not ceased to kiss my feet.

{7:46} My head with oil thou didst not anoint: but this woman hathanointed my feet with ointment. 

{7:47} Wherefore I say unto thee, Hersins, which are many, are forgiven; for she loved much: but to whomlittle is forgiven, [the same] loveth little. 

{7:48} And he said untoher, Thy sins are forgiven. 

{7:49} And they that sat at meat with himbegan to say within themselves, Who is this that forgiveth sins also?

{7:50} And he said to the woman, Thy faith hath saved thee; go in peace.   

{8:1} And it came to pass afterward, that he went throughout everycity and village, preaching and shewing the glad tidings of the kingdomof God: and the twelve [were] with him, 

{8:2} And certain women, whichhad been healed of evil spirits and infirmities, Mary called Magdalene,out of whom went seven devils, 

{8:3} And Joanna the wife of ChuzaHerod's steward, and Susanna, and many others, which ministered untohim of their substance.   

{8:4} And when much people were gathered together, and were come tohim out of every city, he spake by a parable: 

{8:5} A sower went out tosow his seed: and as he sowed, some fell by the way side; and it wastrodden down, and the fowls of the air devoured it. 

{8:6} And some fellupon a rock; and as soon as it was sprung up, it withered away, becauseit lacked moisture. 

{8:7} And some fell among thorns; and the thornssprang up with it, and choked it. 

{8:8} And other fell on good ground,and sprang up, and bare fruit an hundredfold. And when he had saidthese things, he cried, He that hath ears to hear, let him hear. 

{8:9}And his disciples asked him, saying, What might this parable be? 

{8:10}And he said, Unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdomof God: but to others in parables; that seeing they might not see, andhearing they might not understand. 

{8:11} Now the parable is this: Theseed is the word of God. 

{8:12} Those by the way side are they thathear; then cometh the devil, and taketh away the word out of theirhearts, lest they should believe and be saved. 

{8:13} They on the rock[are they,] which, when they hear, receive the word with joy; and thesehave no root, which for a while believe, and in time of temptation fallaway. 

{8:14} And that which fell among thorns are they, which, whenthey have heard, go forth, and are choked with cares and riches andpleasures of [this] life, and bring no fruit to perfection. 

{8:15} Butthat on the good ground are they, which in an honest and good heart,having heard the word, keep [it,] and bring forth fruit with patience.   

{8:16} No man, when he hath lighted a candle, covereth it with avessel, or putteth [it] under a bed; but setteth [it] on a candlestick,that they which enter in may see the light. 

{8:17} For nothing issecret, that shall not be made manifest; neither [any thing] hid, thatshall not be known and come abroad. 

{8:18} Take heed therefore how yehear: for whosoever hath, to him shall be given; and whosoever hathnot, from him shall be taken even that which he seemeth to have.   

{8:19} Then came to him [his] mother and his brethren, and could notcome at him for the press. 

{8:20} And it was told him [by certain]which said, Thy mother and thy brethren stand without, desiring to seethee. 

{8:21} And he answered and said unto them, My mother and mybrethren are these which hear the word of God, and do it.   

{8:22} Now it came to pass on a certain day, that he went into aship with his disciples: and he said unto them, Let us go over unto theother side of the lake. And they launched forth. 

{8:23} But as theysailed he fell asleep: and there came down a storm of wind on the lake;and they were filled [with water,] and were in jeopardy. 

{8:24} Andthey came to him, and awoke him, saying, Master, master, we perish.Then he arose, and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water: andthey ceased, and there was a calm. 

{8:25} And he said unto them, Whereis your faith? And they being afraid wondered, saying one to another,What manner of man is this! for he commandeth even the winds and water,and they obey him.   

{8:26} And they arrived at the country of the Gadarenes, which isover against Galilee. 

{8:27} And when he went forth to land, there methim out of the city a certain man, which had devils long time, and wareno clothes, neither abode in [any] house, but in the tombs. 

{8:28} Whenhe saw Jesus, he cried out, and fell down before him, and with a loudvoice said, What have I to do with thee, Jesus, [thou] Son of God mosthigh? I beseech thee, torment me not. 

{8:29} (For he had commanded theunclean spirit to come out of the man. For oftentimes it had caughthim: and he was kept bound with chains and in fetters; and he brake thebands, and was driven of the devil into the wilderness.) 

{8:30} AndJesus asked him, saying, What is thy name? And he said, Legion: becausemany devils were entered into him. 

{8:31} And they besought him that hewould not command them to go out into the deep. 

{8:32} And there wasthere an herd of many swine feeding on the mountain: and they besoughthim that he would suffer them to enter into them. And he suffered them.

{8:33} Then went the devils out of the man, and entered into the swine:and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the lake, and werechoked. 

{8:34} When they that fed [them] saw what was done, they fled,and went and told [it] in the city and in the country. 

{8:35} Then theywent out to see what was done; and came to Jesus, and found the man,out of whom the devils were departed, sitting at the feet of Jesus,clothed, and in his right mind: and they were afraid. 

{8:36} They alsowhich saw [it] told them by what means he that was possessed of thedevils was healed.   

{8:37} Then the whole multitude of the country of the Gadarenesround about besought him to depart from them; for they were taken withgreat fear: and he went up into the ship, and returned back again.

{8:38} Now the man out of whom the devils were departed besought himthat he might be with him: but Jesus sent him away, saying, 

{8:39}Return to thine own house, and shew how great things God hath done untothee. And he went his way, and published throughout the whole city howgreat things Jesus had done unto him. 

{8:40} And it came to pass, that,when Jesus was returned, the people [gladly] received him: for theywere all waiting for him.   

{8:41} And, behold, there came a man named Jairus, and he was aruler of the synagogue: and he fell down at Jesus' feet, and besoughthim that he would come into his house: 

{8:42} For he had one onlydaughter, about twelve years of age, and she lay a dying. But as hewent the people thronged him.   

{8:43} And a woman having an issue of blood twelve years, which hadspent all her living upon physicians, neither could be healed of any,

{8:44} Came behind [him,] and touched the border of his garment: andimmediately her issue of blood stanched. 

{8:45} And Jesus said, Whotouched me? When all denied, Peter and they that were with him said,Master, the multitude throng thee and press [thee,] and sayest thou,Who touched me? 

{8:46} And Jesus said, Somebody hath touched me: for Iperceive that virtue is gone out of me. 

{8:47} And when the woman sawthat she was not hid, she came trembling, and falling down before him,she declared unto him before all the people for what cause she hadtouched him and how she was healed immediately. 

{8:48} And he said untoher, Daughter, be of good comfort: thy faith hath made thee whole; goin peace.   

{8:49} While he yet spake, there cometh one from the ruler of thesynagogue's [house,] saying to him, Thy daughter is dead; trouble notthe Master. 

{8:50} But when Jesus heard [it,] he answered him, saying,Fear not: believe only, and she shall be made whole. 

{8:51} And when hecame into the house, he suffered no man to go in, save Peter, andJames, and John, and the father and the mother of the maiden. 

{8:52}And all wept, and bewailed her: but he said, Weep not; she is not dead,but sleepeth. 

{8:53} And they laughed him to scorn, knowing that shewas dead. 

{8:54} And he put them all out, and took her by the hand, andcalled, saying, Maid, arise. 

{8:55} And her spirit came again, and shearose straightway: and he commanded to give her meat. 

{8:56} And herparents were astonished: but he charged them that they should tell noman what was done.   

{9:1} Then he called his twelve disciples together, and gave thempower and authority over all devils, and to cure diseases. 

{9:2} And hesent them to preach the kingdom of God, and to heal the sick. 

{9:3} Andhe said unto them, Take nothing for [your] journey, neither staves, norscrip, neither bread, neither money; neither have two coats apiece.

{9:4} And whatsoever house ye enter into, there abide, and thencedepart. 

{9:5} And whosoever will not receive you, when ye go out ofthat city, shake off the very dust from your feet for a testimonyagainst them. 

{9:6} And they departed, and went through the towns,preaching the gospel, and healing every where.   

{9:7} Now Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done by him: andhe was perplexed, because that it was said of some, that John was risenfrom the dead; 

{9:8} And of some, that Elias had appeared; and ofothers, that one of the old prophets was risen again. 

{9:9} And Herodsaid, John have I beheaded: but who is this, of whom I hear suchthings? And he desired to see him.   

{9:10} And the apostles, when they were returned, told him all thatthey had done. And he took them, and went aside privately into a desertplace belonging to the city called Bethsaida. 

{9:11} And the people,when they knew [it,] followed him: and he received them, and spake untothem of the kingdom of God, and healed them that had need of healing.

{9:12} And when the day began to wear away, then came the twelve, andsaid unto him, Send the multitude away, that they may go into the townsand country round about, and lodge, and get victuals: for we are herein a desert place. 

{9:13} But he said unto them, Give ye them to eat.And they said, We have no more but five loaves and two fishes; exceptwe should go and buy meat for all this people. 

{9:14} For they wereabout five thousand men. And he said to his disciples, Make them sitdown by fifties in a company. 

{9:15} And they did so, and made them allsit down. 

{9:16} Then he took the five loaves and the two fishes, andlooking up to heaven, he blessed them, and brake, and gave to thedisciples to set before the multitude. 

{9:17} And they did eat, andwere all filled: and there was taken up of fragments that remained tothem twelve baskets.   

{9:18} And it came to pass, as he was alone praying, his discipleswere with him: and he asked them, saying, Whom say the people that Iam? 

{9:19} They answering said, John the Baptist; but some [say,]Elias; and others [say,] that one of the old prophets is risen again.

{9:20} He said unto them, But whom say ye that I am? Peter answeringsaid, The Christ of God. 

{9:21} And he straitly charged them, andcommanded [them] to tell no man that thing; 

{9:22} Saying, The Son ofman must suffer many things, and be rejected of the elders and chiefpriests and scribes, and be slain, and be raised the third day.   

{9:23} And he said to [them] all, If any [man] will come after me,let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow me.

{9:24} For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: but whosoeverwill lose his life for my sake, the same shall save it. 

{9:25} For whatis a man advantaged, if he gain the whole world, and lose himself, orbe cast away? 

{9:26} For whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of mywords, of him shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he shall come inhis own glory, and [in his] Father's, and of the holy angels. 

{9:27}But I tell you of a truth, there be some standing here, which shall nottaste of death, till they see the kingdom of God.   

{9:28} And it came to pass about an eight days after these sayings,he took Peter and John and James, and went up into a mountain to pray.

{9:29} And as he prayed, the fashion of his countenance was altered,and his raiment [was] white [and] glistering. 

{9:30} And, behold, theretalked with him two men, which were Moses and Elias: 

{9:31} Whoappeared in glory, and spake of his decease which he should accomplishat Jerusalem. 

{9:32} But Peter and they that were with him were heavywith sleep: and when they were awake, they saw his glory, and the twomen that stood with him. 

{9:33} And it came to pass, as they departedfrom him, Peter said unto Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here:and let us make three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, andone for Elias: not knowing what he said. 

{9:34} While he thus spake,there came a cloud, and overshadowed them: and they feared as theyentered into the cloud. 

{9:35} And there came a voice out of the cloud,saying, This is my beloved Son: hear him. 

{9:36} And when the voice waspast, Jesus was found alone. And they kept [it] close, and told no manin those days any of those things which they had seen.   

{9:37} And it came to pass, that on the next day, when they werecome down from the hill, much people met him. 

{9:38} And, behold, a manof the company cried out, saying, Master, I beseech thee, look upon myson: for he is mine only child. 

{9:39} And, lo, a spirit taketh him,and he suddenly crieth out; and it teareth him that he foameth again,and bruising him hardly departeth from him. 

{9:40} And I besought thydisciples to cast him out; and they could not. 

{9:41} And Jesusanswering said, O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall Ibe with you, and suffer you? Bring thy son hither. 

{9:42} And as he wasyet a coming, the devil threw him down, and tare [him.] And Jesusrebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the child, and delivered himagain to his father.   

{9:43} And they were all amazed at the mighty power of God. Butwhile they wondered every one at all things which Jesus did, he saidunto his disciples, 

{9:44} Let these sayings sink down into your ears:for the Son of man shall be delivered into the hands of men. 

{9:45} Butthey understood not this saying, and it was hid from them, that theyperceived it not: and they feared to ask him of that saying.   

{9:46} Then there arose a reasoning among them, which of them shouldbe greatest. 

{9:47} And Jesus, perceiving the thought of their heart,took a child, and set him by him, 

{9:48} And said unto them, Whosoevershall receive this child in my name receiveth me: and whosoever shallreceive me receiveth him that sent me: for he that is least among youall, the same shall be great.   

{9:49} And John answered and said, Master, we saw one casting outdevils in thy name; and we forbad him, because he followeth not withus. 

{9:50} And Jesus said unto him, Forbid [him] not: for he that isnot against us is for us.   

{9:51} And it came to pass, when the time was come that he should bereceived up, he stedfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem, 

{9:52} Andsent messengers before his face: and they went, and entered into avillage of the Samaritans, to make ready for him. 

{9:53} And they didnot receive him, because his face was as though he would go toJerusalem. 

{9:54} And when his disciples James and John saw [this,]they said, Lord, wilt thou that we command fire to come down fromheaven, and consume them, even as Elias did? 

{9:55} But he turned, andrebuked them, and said, Ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of.

{9:56} For the Son of man is not come to destroy men's lives, but tosave [them.] And they went to another village.   

{9:57} And it came to pass, that, as they went in the way, a certain[man] said unto him, Lord, I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest.

{9:58} And Jesus said unto him, Foxes have holes, and birds of the air[have] nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay [his] head.

{9:59} And he said unto another, Follow me. But he said, Lord, sufferme first to go and bury my father. 

{9:60} Jesus said unto him, Let thedead bury their dead: but go thou and preach the kingdom of God. 

{9:61}And another also said, Lord, I will follow thee; but let me first gobid them farewell, which are at home at my house. 

{9:62} And Jesus saidunto him, No man, having put his hand to the plough, and looking back,is fit for the kingdom of God.   

{10:1} After these things the Lord appointed other seventy also, andsent them two and two before his face into every city and place,whither he himself would come. 

{10:2} Therefore said he unto them, Theharvest truly [is] great, but the labourers [are] few: pray yetherefore the Lord of the harvest, that he would send forth labourersinto his harvest. 

{10:3} Go your ways: behold, I send you forth aslambs among wolves. 

{10:4} Carry neither purse, nor scrip, nor shoes:and salute no man by the way. 

{10:5} And into whatsoever house yeenter, first say, Peace [be] to this house. 

{10:6} And if the son ofpeace be there, your peace shall rest upon it: if not, it shall turn toyou again. 

{10:7} And in the same house remain, eating and drinkingsuch things as they give: for the labourer is worthy of his hire. Gonot from house to house. 

{10:8} And into whatsoever city ye enter, andthey receive you, eat such things as are set before you: 

{10:9} Andheal the sick that are therein, and say unto them, The kingdom of Godis come nigh unto you. 

{10:10} But into whatsoever city ye enter, andthey receive you not, go your ways out into the streets of the same,and say, 

{10:11} Even the very dust of your city, which cleaveth on us,we do wipe off against you: notwithstanding be ye sure of this, thatthe kingdom of God is come nigh unto you. 

{10:12} But I say unto you,that it shall be more tolerable in that day for Sodom, than for thatcity. 

{10:13} Woe unto thee, Chorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida! for ifthe mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon, which have been donein you, they had a great while ago repented, sitting in sackcloth andashes. 

{10:14} But it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at thejudgment, than for you. 

{10:15} And thou, Capernaum, which art exaltedto heaven, shalt be thrust down to hell. 

{10:16} He that heareth youheareth me; and he that despiseth you despiseth me; and he thatdespiseth me despiseth him that sent me.   

{10:17} And the seventy returned again with joy, saying, Lord, eventhe devils are subject unto us through thy name. 

{10:18} And he saidunto them, I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven. 

{10:19}Behold, I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions, andover all the power of the enemy: and nothing shall by any means hurtyou. 

{10:20} Notwithstanding in this rejoice not, that the spirits aresubject unto you; but rather rejoice, because your names are written inheaven.   

{10:21} In that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit, and said, I thankthee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou hast hid thesethings from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes:even so, Father; for so it seemed good in thy sight. 

{10:22} All thingsare delivered to me of my Father: and no man knoweth who the Son is,but the Father; and who the Father is, but the Son, and [he] to whomthe Son will reveal [him.]   

{10:23} And he turned him unto [his] disciples, and said privately,Blessed [are] the eyes which see the things that ye see: 

{10:24} For Itell you, that many prophets and kings have desired to see those thingswhich ye see, and have not seen [them;] and to hear those things whichye hear, and have not heard [them.]   

{10:25} And, behold, a certain lawyer stood up, and tempted him,saying, Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life? 

{10:26} Hesaid unto him, What is written in the law? how readest thou? 

{10:27}And he answering said, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thyheart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with allthy mind; and thy neighbour as thyself. 

{10:28} And he said unto him,Thou hast answered right: this do, and thou shalt live. 

{10:29} But he,willing to justify himself, said unto Jesus, And who is my neighbour?

{10:30} And Jesus answering said, A certain [man] went down fromJerusalem to Jericho, and fell among thieves, which stripped him of hisraiment, and wounded [him,] and departed, leaving [him] half dead.

{10:31} And by chance there came down a certain priest that way: andwhen he saw him, he passed by on the other side. 

{10:32} And likewise aLevite, when he was at the place, came and looked [on him,] and passedby on the other side. 

{10:33} But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed,came where he was: and when he saw him, he had compassion [on him,]

{10:34} And went to [him,] and bound up his wounds, pouring in oil andwine, and set him on his own beast, and brought him to an inn, and tookcare of him. 

{10:35} And on the morrow when he departed, he took outtwo pence, and gave [them] to the host, and said unto him, Take care ofhim; and whatsoever thou spendest more, when I come again, I will repaythee. 

{10:36} Which now of these three, thinkest thou, was neighbourunto him that fell among the thieves? 

{10:37} And he said, He thatshewed mercy on him. Then said Jesus unto him, Go, and do thou likewise.   

{10:38} Now it came to pass, as they went, that he entered into acertain village: and a certain woman named Martha received him into herhouse. 

{10:39} And she had a sister called Mary, which also sat atJesus' feet, and heard his word. 

{10:40} But Martha was cumbered aboutmuch serving, and came to him, and said, Lord, dost thou not care thatmy sister hath left me to serve alone? bid her therefore that she helpme. 

{10:41} And Jesus answered and said unto her, Martha, Martha, thouart careful and troubled about many things: 

{10:42} But one thing isneedful: and Mary hath chosen that good part, which shall not be takenaway from her.   

{11:1} And it came to pass, that, as he was praying in a certainplace, when he ceased, one of his disciples said unto him, Lord, teachus to pray, as John also taught his disciples. 

{11:2} And he said untothem, When ye pray, say, Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed bethy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done, as in heaven, so inearth. 

{11:3} Give us day by day our daily bread. 

{11:4} And forgive usour sins; for we also forgive every one that is indebted to us. Andlead us not into temptation; but deliver us from evil. 

{11:5} And hesaid unto them, Which of you shall have a friend, and shall go unto himat midnight, and say unto him, Friend, lend me three loaves; 

{11:6} Fora friend of mine in his journey is come to me, and I have nothing toset before him? 

{11:7} And he from within shall answer and say, Troubleme not: the door is now shut, and my children are with me in bed; Icannot rise and give thee. 

{11:8} I say unto you, Though he will notrise and give him, because he is his friend, yet because of hisimportunity he will rise and give him as many as he needeth. 

{11:9} AndI say unto you, Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shallfind; knock, and it shall be opened unto you. 

{11:10} For every onethat asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him thatknocketh it shall be opened. 

{11:11} If a son shall ask bread of any ofyou that is a father, will he give him a stone? or if [he ask] a fish,will he for a fish give him a serpent? 

{11:12} Or if he shall ask anegg, will he offer him a scorpion? 

{11:13} If ye then, being evil, knowhow to give good gifts unto your children: how much more shall [your]heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him?   

{11:14} And he was casting out a devil, and it was dumb. And it cameto pass, when the devil was gone out, the dumb spake; and the peoplewondered. 

{11:15} But some of them said, He casteth out devils throughBeelzebub the chief of the devils. 

{11:16} And others, tempting [him,]sought of him a sign from heaven. 

{11:17} But he, knowing theirthoughts, said unto them, Every kingdom divided against itself isbrought to desolation; and a house [divided] against a house falleth.

{11:18} If Satan also be divided against himself, how shall his kingdomstand? because ye say that I cast out devils through Beelzebub. 

{11:19}And if I by Beelzebub cast out devils, by whom do your sons cast [them]out? therefore shall they be your judges. 

{11:20} But if I with thefinger of God cast out devils, no doubt the kingdom of God is come uponyou. 

{11:21} When a strong man armed keepeth his palace, his goods arein peace: 

{11:22} But when a stronger than he shall come upon him, andovercome him, he taketh from him all his armour wherein he trusted, anddivideth his spoils. 

{11:23} He that is not with me is against me: andhe that gathereth not with me scattereth. 

{11:24} When the uncleanspirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through dry places, seekingrest; and finding none, he saith, I will return unto my house whence Icame out. 

{11:25} And when he cometh, he findeth [it] swept andgarnished. 

{11:26} Then goeth he, and taketh [to him] seven otherspirits more wicked than himself; and they enter in, and dwell there:and the last [state] of that man is worse than the first.   

{11:27} And it came to pass, as he spake these things, a certainwoman of the company lifted up her voice, and said unto him, Blessed isthe womb that bare thee, and the paps which thou hast sucked. 

{11:28}But he said, Yea rather, blessed [are] they that hear the word of God,and keep it.   

{11:29} And when the people were gathered thick together, he beganto say, This is an evil generation: they seek a sign; and there shallno sign be given it, but the sign of Jonas the prophet. 

{11:30} For asJonas was a sign unto the Ninevites, so shall also the Son of man be tothis generation. 

{11:31} The queen of the south shall rise up in thejudgment with the men of this generation, and condemn them: for shecame from the utmost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon;and, behold, a greater than Solomon is here. 

{11:32} The men of Nineveshall rise up in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemnit: for they repented at the preaching of Jonas; and, behold, a greaterthan Jonas [is] here. 

{11:33} No man, when he hath lighted a candle,putteth [it] in a secret place, neither under a bushel, but on acandlestick, that they which come in may see the light. 

{11:34} Thelight of the body is the eye: therefore when thine eye is single, thywhole body also is full of light; but when [thine eye] is evil, thybody also [is] full of darkness. 

{11:35} Take heed therefore that thelight which is in thee be not darkness. 

{11:36} If thy whole bodytherefore [be] full of light, having no part dark, the whole shall befull of light, as when the bright shining of a candle doth give theelight.   

{11:37} And as he spake, a certain Pharisee besought him to dinewith him: and he went in, and sat down to meat. 

{11:38} And when thePharisee saw [it,] he marvelled that he had not first washed beforedinner. 

{11:39} And the Lord said unto him, Now do ye Pharisees makeclean the outside of the cup and the platter; but your inward part isfull of ravening and wickedness. 

{11:40} [Ye] fools, did not he thatmade that which is without make that which is within also? 

{11:41} Butrather give alms of such things as ye have; and, behold, all things areclean unto you. 

{11:42} But woe unto you, Pharisees! for ye tithe mintand rue and all manner of herbs, and pass over judgment and the love ofGod: these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone.

{11:43} Woe unto you, Pharisees! for ye love the uppermost seats in thesynagogues, and greetings in the markets. 

{11:44} Woe unto you, scribesand Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are as graves which appear not, andthe men that walk over [them] are not aware [of them.]   

{11:45} Then answered one of the lawyers, and said unto him, Master,thus saying thou reproachest us also. 

{11:46} And he said, Woe unto youalso, [ye] lawyers! for ye lade men with burdens grievous to be borne,and ye yourselves touch not the burdens with one of your fingers.

{11:47} Woe unto you! for ye build the sepulchres of the prophets, andyour fathers killed them. 

{11:48} Truly ye bear witness that ye allowthe deeds of your fathers: for they indeed killed them, and ye buildtheir sepulchres. 

{11:49} Therefore also said the wisdom of God, I willsend them prophets and apostles, and [some] of them they shall slay andpersecute: 

{11:50} That the blood of all the prophets, which was shedfrom the foundation of the world, may be required of this generation;

{11:51} From the blood of Abel unto the blood of Zacharias, whichperished between the altar and the temple: verily I say unto you, Itshall be required of this generation. 

{11:52} Woe unto you, lawyers!for ye have taken away the key of knowledge: ye entered not inyourselves, and them that were entering in ye hindered. 

{11:53} And ashe said these things unto them, the scribes and the Pharisees began tourge [him] vehemently, and to provoke him to speak of many things:

{11:54} Laying wait for him, and seeking to catch something out of hismouth, that they might accuse him.   

{12:1} In the mean time, when there were gathered together aninnumerable multitude of people, insomuch that they trode one uponanother, he began to say unto his disciples first of all, Beware ye ofthe leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy. 

{12:2} For there isnothing covered, that shall not be revealed; neither hid, that shallnot be known. 

{12:3} Therefore whatsoever ye have spoken in darknessshall be heard in the light; and that which ye have spoken in the earin closets shall be proclaimed upon the housetops. 

{12:4} And I sayunto you my friends, Be not afraid of them that kill the body, andafter that have no more that they can do. 

{12:5} But I will forewarnyou whom ye shall fear: Fear him, which after he hath killed hath powerto cast into hell; yea, I say unto you, Fear him. 

{12:6} Are not fivesparrows sold for two farthings, and not one of them is forgottenbefore God? 

{12:7} But even the very hairs of your head are allnumbered. Fear not therefore: ye are of more value than many sparrows.

{12:8} Also I say unto you, Whosoever shall confess me before men, himshall the Son of man also confess before the angels of God: 

{12:9} Buthe that denieth me before men shall be denied before the angels of God.

{12:10} And whosoever shall speak a word against the Son of man, itshall be forgiven him: but unto him that blasphemeth against the HolyGhost it shall not be forgiven. 

{12:11} And when they bring you untothe synagogues, and [unto] magistrates, and powers, take ye no thoughthow or what thing ye shall answer, or what ye shall say: 

{12:12} Forthe Holy Ghost shall teach you in the same hour what ye ought to say.   

{12:13} And one of the company said unto him, Master, speak to mybrother, that he divide the inheritance with me. 

{12:14} And he saidunto him, Man, who made me a judge or a divider over you? 

{12:15} Andhe said unto them, Take heed, and beware of covetousness: for a man'slife consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth.

{12:16} And he spake a parable unto them, saying, The ground of acertain rich man brought forth plentifully: 

{12:17} And he thoughtwithin himself, saying, What shall I do, because I have no room whereto bestow my fruits? 

{12:18} And he said, This will I do: I will pulldown my barns, and build greater; and there will I bestow all my fruitsand my goods. 

{12:19} And I will say to my soul, Soul, thou hast muchgoods laid up for many years; take thine ease, eat, drink, [and] bemerry. 

{12:20} But God said unto him, [Thou] fool, this night thy soulshall be required of thee: then whose shall those things be, which thouhast provided? 

{12:21} So [is] he that layeth up treasure for himself,and is not rich toward God.   

{12:22} And he said unto his disciples, Therefore I say unto you,Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat; neither for the body,what ye shall put on. 

{12:23} The life is more than meat, and the body[is more] than raiment. 

{12:24} Consider the ravens: for they neithersow nor reap; which neither have storehouse nor barn; and God feedeththem: how much more are ye better than the fowls? 

{12:25} And which ofyou with taking thought can add to his stature one cubit? 

{12:26} If yethen be not able to do that thing which is least, why take ye thoughtfor the rest? 

{12:27} Consider the lilies how they grow: they toil not,they spin not; and yet I say unto you, that Solomon in all his glorywas not arrayed like one of these. 

{12:28} If then God so clothe thegrass, which is to day in the field, and to morrow is cast into theoven; how much more [will he clothe] you, O ye of little faith? 

{12:29}And seek not ye what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink, neither beye of doubtful mind. 

{12:30} For all these things do the nations of theworld seek after: and your Father knoweth that ye have need of thesethings.   

{12:31} But rather seek ye the kingdom of God; and all these thingsshall be added unto you. 

{12:32} Fear not, little flock; for it is yourFather's good pleasure to give you the kingdom. 

{12:33} Sell that yehave, and give alms; provide yourselves bags which wax not old, atreasure in the heavens that faileth not, where no thief approacheth,neither moth corrupteth. 

{12:34} For where your treasure is, there willyour heart be also. 

{12:35} Let your loins be girded about, and [your]lights burning; 

{12:36} And ye yourselves like unto men that wait fortheir lord, when he will return from the wedding; that when he comethand knocketh, they may open unto him immediately. 

{12:37} Blessed [are]those servants, whom the lord when he cometh shall find watching:verily I say unto you, that he shall gird himself, and make them to sitdown to meat, and will come forth and serve them. 

{12:38} And if heshall come in the second watch, or come in the third watch, and find[them] so, blessed are those servants. 

{12:39} And this know, that ifthe goodman of the house had known what hour the thief would come, hewould have watched, and not have suffered his house to be brokenthrough. 

{12:40} Be ye therefore ready also: for the Son of man comethat an hour when ye think not.   

{12:41} Then Peter said unto him, Lord, speakest thou this parableunto us, or even to all? 

{12:42} And the Lord said, Who then is thatfaithful and wise steward, whom [his] lord shall make ruler over hishousehold, to give [them their] portion of meat in due season? 

{12:43}Blessed [is] that servant, whom his lord when he cometh shall find sodoing. 

{12:44} Of a truth I say unto you, that he will make him rulerover all that he hath. 

{12:45} But and if that servant say in hisheart, My lord delayeth his coming; and shall begin to beat themenservants and maidens, and to eat and drink, and to be drunken;

{12:46} The lord of that servant will come in a day when he looketh notfor [him,] and at an hour when he is not aware, and will cut him insunder, and will appoint him his portion with the unbelievers. 

{12:47}And that servant, which knew his lord's will, and prepared not[himself,] neither did according to his will, shall be beaten with many[stripes. ]

{12:48} But he that knew not, and did commit things worthyof stripes, shall be beaten with few [stripes.] For unto whomsoevermuch is given, of him shall be much required: and to whom men havecommitted much, of him they will ask the more.   

{12:49} I am come to send fire on the earth; and what will I if itbe already kindled? 

{12:50} But I have a baptism to be baptized with;and how am I straitened till it be accomplished! 

{12:51} Suppose yethat I am come to give peace on earth? I tell you, Nay; but ratherdivision: 

{12:52} For from henceforth there shall be five in one housedivided, three against two, and two against three. 

{12:53} The fathershall be divided against the son, and the son against the father; themother against the daughter, and the daughter against the mother; themother in law against her daughter in law, and the daughter in lawagainst her mother in law.   

{12:54} And he said also to the people, When ye see a cloud rise outof the west, straightway ye say, There cometh a shower; and so it is.

{12:55} And when [ye see] the south wind blow, ye say, There will beheat; and it cometh to pass. 

{12:56} [Ye] hypocrites, ye can discernthe face of the sky and of the earth; but how is it that ye do notdiscern this time? 

{12:57} Yea, and why even of yourselves judge ye notwhat is right?   

{12:58} When thou goest with thine adversary to the magistrate, [asthou art] in the way, give diligence that thou mayest be delivered fromhim; lest he hale thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to theofficer, and the officer cast thee into prison. 

{12:59} I tell thee,thou shalt not depart thence, till thou hast paid the very last mite.   

{13:1} There were present at that season some that told him of theGalilaeans, whose blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices.

{13:2} And Jesus answering said unto them, Suppose ye that theseGalilaeans were sinners above all the Galilaeans, because they sufferedsuch things? 

{13:3} I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shallall likewise perish. 

{13:4} Or those eighteen, upon whom the tower inSiloam fell, and slew them, think ye that they were sinners above allmen that dwelt in Jerusalem? 

{13:5} I tell you, Nay: but, except yerepent, ye shall all likewise perish.   

{13:6} He spake also this parable; A certain [man] had a fig treeplanted in his vineyard; and he came and sought fruit thereon, andfound none. 

{13:7} Then said he unto the dresser of his vineyard,Behold, these three years I come seeking fruit on this fig tree, andfind none: cut it down; why cumbereth it the ground? 

{13:8} And heanswering said unto him, Lord, let it alone this year also, till Ishall dig about it, and dung [it: ]

{13:9} And if it bear fruit, [well:]and if not, [then] after that thou shalt cut it down. 

{13:10} And hewas teaching in one of the synagogues on the sabbath.   

{13:11} And, behold, there was a woman which had a spirit ofinfirmity eighteen years, and was bowed together, and could in no wiselift up [herself. ]

{13:12} And when Jesus saw her, he called [her tohim,] and said unto her, Woman, thou art loosed from thine infirmity.

{13:13} And he laid [his] hands on her: and immediately she was madestraight, and glorified God. 

{13:14} And the ruler of the synagogueanswered with indignation, because that Jesus had healed on the sabbathday, and said unto the people, There are six days in which men ought towork: in them therefore come and be healed, and not on the sabbath day.

{13:15} The Lord then answered him, and said, [Thou] hypocrite, dothnot each one of you on the sabbath loose his ox or [his] ass from thestall, and lead [him] away to watering? 

{13:16} And ought not thiswoman, being a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan hath bound, lo, theseeighteen years, be loosed from this bond on the sabbath day? 

{13:17}And when he had said these things, all his adversaries were ashamed:and all the people rejoiced for all the glorious things that were doneby him.   

{13:18} Then said he, Unto what is the kingdom of God like? andwhereunto shall I resemble it? 

{13:19} It is like a grain of mustardseed, which a man took, and cast into his garden; and it grew, andwaxed a great tree; and the fowls of the air lodged in the branches ofit. 

{13:20} And again he said, Whereunto shall I liken the kingdom ofGod? 

{13:21} It is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in threemeasures of meal, till the whole was leavened. 

{13:22} And he wentthrough the cities and villages, teaching, and journeying towardJerusalem. 

{13:23} Then said one unto him, Lord, are there few that besaved? And he said unto them,   

{13:24} Strive to enter in at the strait gate: for many, I say untoyou, will seek to enter in, and shall not be able. 

{13:25} When oncethe master of the house is risen up, and hath shut to the door, and yebegin to stand without, and to knock at the door, saying, Lord, Lord,open unto us; and he shall answer and say unto you, I know you notwhence ye are: 

{13:26} Then shall ye begin to say, We have eaten anddrunk in thy presence, and thou hast taught in our streets. 

{13:27} Buthe shall say, I tell you, I know you not whence ye are; depart from me,all [ye] workers of iniquity. 

{13:28} There shall be weeping andgnashing of teeth, when ye shall see Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, andall the prophets, in the kingdom of God, and you [yourselves] thrustout. 

{13:29} And they shall come from the east, and [from] the west,and from the north, and [from] the south, and shall sit down in thekingdom of God. 

{13:30} And, behold, there are last which shall befirst, and there are first which shall be last.   

{13:31} The same day there came certain of the Pharisees, sayingunto him, Get thee out, and depart hence: for Herod will kill thee.

{13:32} And he said unto them, Go ye, and tell that fox, Behold, I castout devils, and I do cures to day and to morrow, and the third [day] Ishall be perfected. 

{13:33} Nevertheless I must walk to day, and tomorrow, and the [day] following: for it cannot be that a prophet perishout of Jerusalem. 

{13:34} O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, which killest theprophets, and stonest them that are sent unto thee; how often would Ihave gathered thy children together, as a hen [doth gather] her broodunder [her] wings, and ye would not! 

{13:35} Behold, your house is leftunto you desolate: and verily I say unto you, Ye shall not see me,until [the time] come when ye shall say, Blessed [is] he that cometh inthe name of the Lord.   

{14:1} And it came to pass, as he went into the house of one of thechief Pharisees to eat bread on the sabbath day, that they watched him.

{14:2} And, behold, there was a certain man before him which had thedropsy. 

{14:3} And Jesus answering spake unto the lawyers andPharisees, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath day? 

{14:4} Andthey held their peace. And he took [him,] and healed him, and let himgo; 

{14:5} And answered them, saying, Which of you shall have an ass oran ox fallen into a pit, and will not straightway pull him out on thesabbath day? 

{14:6} And they could not answer him again to these things.   

{14:7} And he put forth a parable to those which were bidden, whenhe marked how they chose out the chief rooms; saying unto them, 

{14:8}When thou art bidden of any [man] to a wedding, sit not down in thehighest room; lest a more honourable man than thou be bidden of him;

{14:9} And he that bade thee and him come and say to thee, Give thisman place; and thou begin with shame to take the lowest room. 

{14:10}But when thou art bidden, go and sit down in the lowest room; that whenhe that bade thee cometh, he may say unto thee, Friend, go up higher:then shalt thou have worship in the presence of them that sit at meatwith thee. 

{14:11} For whosoever exalteth himself shall be abased; andhe that humbleth himself shall be exalted.   

{14:12} Then said he also to him that bade him, When thou makest adinner or a supper, call not thy friends, nor thy brethren, neither thykinsmen, nor [thy] rich neighbours; lest they also bid thee again, anda recompence be made thee. 

{14:13} But when thou makest a feast, callthe poor, the maimed, the lame, the blind: 

{14:14} And thou shalt beblessed; for they cannot recompense thee: for thou shalt be recompensedat the resurrection of the just.   

{14:15} And when one of them that sat at meat with him heard thesethings, he said unto him, Blessed [is] he that shall eat bread in thekingdom of God. 

{14:16} Then said he unto him, A certain man made agreat supper, and bade many: 

{14:17} And sent his servant at suppertime to say to them that were bidden, Come; for all things are nowready. 

{14:18} And they all with one [consent] began to make excuse.The first said unto him, I have bought a piece of ground, and I mustneeds go and see it: I pray thee have me excused. 

{14:19} And anothersaid, I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I go to prove them: I praythee have me excused. 

{14:20} And another said, I have married a wife,and therefore I cannot come. 

{14:21} So that servant came, and shewedhis lord these things. Then the master of the house being angry said tohis servant, Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city, andbring in hither the poor, and the maimed, and the halt, and the blind.

{14:22} And the servant said, Lord, it is done as thou hast commanded,and yet there is room. 

{14:23} And the lord said unto the servant, Goout into the highways and hedges, and compel [them] to come in, that myhouse may be filled. 

{14:24} For I say unto you, That none of those menwhich were bidden shall taste of my supper.   

{14:25} And there went great multitudes with him: and he turned, andsaid unto them, 

{14:26} If any [man] come to me, and hate not hisfather, and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters,yea, and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple. 

{14:27} Andwhosoever doth not bear his cross, and come after me, cannot be mydisciple. 

{14:28} For which of you, intending to build a tower, sittethnot down first, and counteth the cost, whether he have [sufficient] tofinish [it? ]

{14:29} Lest haply, after he hath laid the foundation, andis not able to finish [it,] all that behold [it] begin to mock him,

{14:30} Saying, This man began to build, and was not able to finish.

{14:31} Or what king, going to make war against another king, sittethnot down first, and consulteth whether he be able with ten thousand tomeet him that cometh against him with twenty thousand? 

{14:32} Or else,while the other is yet a great way off, he sendeth an ambassage, anddesireth conditions of peace. 

{14:33} So likewise, whosoever he be ofyou that forsaketh not all that he hath, he cannot be my disciple.   

{14:34} Salt [is] good: but if the salt have lost his savour,wherewith shall it be seasoned? 

{14:35} It is neither fit for the land,nor yet for the dunghill; [but] men cast it out. He that hath ears tohear, let him hear.   

{15:1} Then drew near unto him all the publicans and sinners for tohear him. 

{15:2} And the Pharisees and scribes murmured, saying, Thisman receiveth sinners, and eateth with them.   

{15:3} And he spake this parable unto them, saying, 

{15:4} What manof you, having an hundred sheep, if he lose one of them, doth not leavethe ninety and nine in the wilderness, and go after that which is lost,until he find it? 

{15:5} And when he hath found [it,] he layeth [it] onhis shoulders, rejoicing. 

{15:6} And when he cometh home, he callethtogether [his] friends and neighbours, saying unto them, Rejoice withme; for I have found my sheep which was lost. 

{15:7} I say unto you,that likewise joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that repenteth,more than over ninety and nine just persons, which need no repentance.   

{15:8} Either what woman having ten pieces of silver, if she loseone piece, doth not light a candle, and sweep the house, and seekdiligently till she find [it? ]

{15:9} And when she hath found [it,] shecalleth [her] friends and [her] neighbours together, saying, Rejoicewith me; for I have found the piece which I had lost. 

{15:10} Likewise,I say unto you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God overone sinner that repenteth.   

{15:11} And he said, A certain man had two sons: 

{15:12} And theyounger of them said to [his] father, Father, give me the portion ofgoods that falleth [to me.] And he divided unto them [his] living.

{15:13} And not many days after the younger son gathered all together,and took his journey into a far country, and there wasted his substancewith riotous living. 

{15:14} And when he had spent all, there arose amighty famine in that land; and he began to be in want. 

{15:15} And hewent and joined himself to a citizen of that country; and he sent himinto his fields to feed swine. 

{15:16} And he would fain have filledhis belly with the husks that the swine did eat: and no man gave untohim. 

{15:17} And when he came to himself, he said, How many hiredservants of my father's have bread enough and to spare, and I perishwith hunger! 

{15:18} I will arise and go to my father, and will sayunto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and before thee,

{15:19} And am no more worthy to be called thy son: make me as one ofthy hired servants. 

{15:20} And he arose, and came to his father. Butwhen he was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and hadcompassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him. 

{15:21} Andthe son said unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in thysight, and am no more worthy to be called thy son. 

{15:22} But thefather said to his servants, Bring forth the best robe, and put [it] onhim; and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on [his] feet: 

{15:23} Andbring hither the fatted calf, and kill [it;] and let us eat, and bemerry: 

{15:24} For this my son was dead, and is alive again; he waslost, and is found. And they began to be merry. 

{15:25} Now his elderson was in the field: and as he came and drew nigh to the house, heheard musick and dancing. 

{15:26} And he called one of the servants,and asked what these things meant. 

{15:27} And he said unto him, Thybrother is come; and thy father hath killed the fatted calf, because hehath received him safe and sound. 

{15:28} And he was angry, and wouldnot go in: therefore came his father out, and intreated him. 

{15:29}And he answering said to [his] father, Lo, these many years do I servethee, neither transgressed I at any time thy commandment: and yet thounever gavest me a kid, that I might make merry with my friends: 

{15:30}But as soon as this thy son was come, which hath devoured thy livingwith harlots, thou hast killed for him the fatted calf. 

{15:31} And hesaid unto him, Son, thou art ever with me, and all that I have isthine. 

{15:32} It was meet that we should make merry, and be glad: forthis thy brother was dead, and is alive again; and was lost, and isfound.   

{16:1} And he said also unto his disciples, There was a certain richman, which had a steward; and the same was accused unto him that he hadwasted his goods. 

{16:2} And he called him, and said unto him, How isit that I hear this of thee? give an account of thy stewardship; forthou mayest be no longer steward. 

{16:3} Then the steward said withinhimself, What shall I do? for my lord taketh away from me thestewardship: I cannot dig; to beg I am ashamed. 

{16:4} I am resolvedwhat to do, that, when I am put out of the stewardship, they mayreceive me into their houses. 

{16:5} So he called every one of hislord's debtors [unto him,] and said unto the first, How much owest thouunto my lord? 

{16:6} And he said, An hundred measures of oil. And hesaid unto him, Take thy bill, and sit down quickly, and write fifty.

{16:7} Then said he to another, And how much owest thou? And he said,An hundred measures of wheat. And he said unto him, Take thy bill, andwrite fourscore. 

{16:8} And the lord commended the unjust steward,because he had done wisely: for the children of this world are in theirgeneration wiser than the children of light. 

{16:9} And I say unto you,Make to yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness; that, whenye fail, they may receive you into everlasting habitations. 

{16:10} Hethat is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much: andhe that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much. 

{16:11} Iftherefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who willcommit to your trust the true [riches? ]

{16:12} And if ye have not beenfaithful in that which is another man's, who shall give you that whichis your own?   

{16:13} No servant can serve two masters: for either he will hatethe one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, anddespise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon. 

{16:14} And thePharisees also, who were covetous, heard all these things: and theyderided him. 

{16:15} And he said unto them, Ye are they which justifyyourselves before men; but God knoweth your hearts: for that which ishighly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of God. 

{16:16}The law and the prophets [were] until John: since that time the kingdomof God is preached, and every man presseth into it. 

{16:17} And it iseasier for heaven and earth to pass, than one tittle of the law tofail. 

{16:18} Whosoever putteth away his wife, and marrieth another,committeth adultery: and whosoever marrieth her that is put away from[her] husband committeth adultery.   

{16:19} There was a certain rich man, which was clothed in purpleand fine linen, and fared sumptuously every day: 

{16:20} And there wasa certain beggar named Lazarus, which was laid at his gate, full ofsores, 

{16:21} And desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell fromthe rich man's table: moreover the dogs came and licked his sores.

{16:22} And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried bythe angels into Abraham's bosom: the rich man also died, and wasburied; 

{16:23} And in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments, andseeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom. 

{16:24} And he criedand said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that hemay dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I amtormented in this flame. 

{16:25} But Abraham said, Son, remember thatthou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things, and likewise Lazarusevil things: but now he is comforted, and thou art tormented. 

{16:26}And beside all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed: sothat they which would pass from hence to you cannot; neither can theypass to us, that [would come] from thence. 

{16:27} Then he said, I praythee therefore, father, that thou wouldest send him to my father'shouse: 

{16:28} For I have five brethren; that he may testify unto them,lest they also come into this place of torment. 

{16:29} Abraham saithunto him, They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them. 

{16:30}And he said, Nay, father Abraham: but if one went unto them from thedead, they will repent. 

{16:31} And he said unto him, If they hear notMoses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded, though one rosefrom the dead.   

{17:1} Then said he unto the disciples, It is impossible but thatoffences will come: but woe [unto him,] through whom they come! 

{17:2}It were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, andhe cast into the sea, than that he should offend one of these littleones.   

{17:3} Take heed to yourselves: If thy brother trespass againstthee, rebuke him; and if he repent, forgive him. 

{17:4} And if hetrespass against thee seven times in a day, and seven times in a dayturn again to thee, saying, I repent; thou shalt forgive him. 

{17:5}And the apostles said unto the Lord, Increase our faith. 

{17:6} And theLord said, If ye had faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye might sayunto this sycamine tree, Be thou plucked up by the root, and be thouplanted in the sea; and it should obey you. 

{17:7} But which of you,having a servant plowing or feeding cattle, will say unto him by andby, when he is come from the field, Go and sit down to meat? 

{17:8} Andwill not rather say unto him, Make ready wherewith I may sup, and girdthyself, and serve me, till I have eaten and drunken; and afterwardthou shalt eat and drink? 

{17:9} Doth he thank that servant because hedid the things that were commanded him? I trow not. 

{17:10} So likewiseye, when ye shall have done all those things which are commanded you,say, We are unprofitable servants: we have done that which was our dutyto do.   

{17:11} And it came to pass, as he went to Jerusalem, that he passedthrough the midst of Samaria and Galilee. 

{17:12} And as he enteredinto a certain village, there met him ten men that were lepers, whichstood afar off: 

{17:13} And they lifted up [their] voices, and said,Jesus, Master, have mercy on us. 

{17:14} And when he saw [them,] hesaid unto them, Go shew yourselves unto the priests. And it came topass, that, as they went, they were cleansed. 

{17:15} And one of them,when he saw that he was healed, turned back, and with a loud voiceglorified God, 

{17:16} And fell down on [his] face at his feet, givinghim thanks: and he was a Samaritan. 

{17:17} And Jesus answering said,Were there not ten cleansed? but where [are] the nine? 

{17:18} Thereare not found that returned to give glory to God, save this stranger.

{17:19} And he said unto him, Arise, go thy way: thy faith hath madethee whole.   

{17:20} And when he was demanded of the Pharisees, when the kingdomof God should come, he answered them and said, The kingdom of Godcometh not with observation: 

{17:21} Neither shall they say, Lo here!or, lo there! for, behold, the kingdom of God is within you. 

{17:22}And he said unto the disciples, The days will come, when ye shalldesire to see one of the days of the Son of man, and ye shall not see[it. ]

{17:23} And they shall say to you, See here; or, see there: gonot after [them,] nor follow [them. ]

{17:24} For as the lightning, thatlighteneth out of the one [part] under heaven, shineth unto the other[part] under heaven; so shall also the Son of man be in his day.

{17:25} But first must he suffer many things, and be rejected of thisgeneration. 

{17:26} And as it was in the days of Noe, so shall it bealso in the days of the Son of man. 

{17:27} They did eat, they drank,they married wives, they were given in marriage, until the day that Noeentered into the ark, and the flood came, and destroyed them all.

{17:28} Likewise also as it was in the days of Lot; they did eat, theydrank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they builded; 

{17:29} Butthe same day that Lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstonefrom heaven, and destroyed [them] all. 

{17:30} Even thus shall it be inthe day when the Son of man is revealed. 

{17:31} In that day, he whichshall be upon the housetop, and his stuff in the house, let him notcome down to take it away: and he that is in the field, let himlikewise not return back. 

{17:32} Remember Lot's wife. 

{17:33}Whosoever shall seek to save his life shall lose it; and whosoevershall lose his life shall preserve it. 

{17:34} I tell you, in thatnight there shall be two [men] in one bed; the one shall be taken, andthe other shall be left. 

{17:35} Two [women] shall be grindingtogether; the one shall be taken, and the other left. 

{17:36} Two [men]shall be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the other left.

{17:37} And they answered and said unto him, Where, Lord? And he saidunto them, Wheresoever the body is, thither will the eagles be gatheredtogether.   

{18:1} And he spake a parable unto them [to this end,] that menought always to pray, and not to faint; 

{18:2} Saying, There was in acity a judge, which feared not God, neither regarded man: 

{18:3} Andthere was a widow in that city; and she came unto him, saying, Avengeme of mine adversary. 

{18:4} And he would not for a while: butafterward he said within himself, Though I fear not God, nor regardman; 

{18:5} Yet because this widow troubleth me, I will avenge her,lest by her continual coming she weary me. 

{18:6} And the Lord said,Hear what the unjust judge saith. 

{18:7} And shall not God avenge hisown elect, which cry day and night unto him, though he bear long withthem? 

{18:8} I tell you that he will avenge them speedily. Neverthelesswhen the Son of man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth? 

{18:9}And he spake this parable unto certain which trusted in themselves thatthey were righteous, and despised others: 

{18:10} Two men went up intothe temple to pray; the one a Pharisee, and the other a publican.

{18:11} The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, God, I thankthee, that I am not as other men [are,] extortioners, unjust,adulterers, or even as this publican. 

{18:12} I fast twice in the week,I give tithes of all that I possess. 

{18:13} And the publican, standingafar off, would not lift up so much as [his] eyes unto heaven, butsmote upon his breast, saying, God be merciful to me a sinner. 

{18:14}I tell you, this man went down to his house justified [rather] than theother: for every one that exalteth himself shall be abased; and he thathumbleth himself shall be exalted. 

{18:15} And they brought unto himalso infants, that he would touch them: but when [his] disciples saw[it,] they rebuked them. 

{18:16} But Jesus called them [unto him,] andsaid, Suffer little children to come unto me, and forbid them not: forof such is the kingdom of God. 

{18:17} Verily I say unto you, Whosoevershall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child shall in no wiseenter therein. 

{18:18} And a certain ruler asked him, saying, GoodMaster, what shall I do to inherit eternal life? 

{18:19} And Jesus saidunto him, Why callest thou me good? none [is] good, save one, [thatis,] God. 

{18:20} Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commitadultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Honourthy father and thy mother. 

{18:21} And he said, All these have I keptfrom my youth up. 

{18:22} Now when Jesus heard these things, he saidunto him, Yet lackest thou one thing: sell all that thou hast, anddistribute unto the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: andcome, follow me. 

{18:23} And when he heard this, he was very sorrowful:for he was very rich. 

{18:24} And when Jesus saw that he was verysorrowful, he said, How hardly shall they that have riches enter intothe kingdom of God! 

{18:25} For it is easier for a camel to go througha needle's eye, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.

{18:26} And they that heard [it] said, Who then can be saved? 

{18:27}And he said, The things which are impossible with men are possible withGod. 

{18:28} Then Peter said, Lo, we have left all, and followed thee.

{18:29} And he said unto them, Verily I say unto you, There is no manthat hath left house, or parents, or brethren, or wife, or children,for the kingdom of God's sake, 

{18:30} Who shall not receive manifoldmore in this present time, and in the world to come life everlasting.   

{18:31} Then he took [unto him] the twelve, and said unto them,Behold, we go up to Jerusalem, and all things that are written by theprophets concerning the Son of man shall be accomplished. 

{18:32} Forhe shall be delivered unto the Gentiles, and shall be mocked, andspitefully entreated, and spitted on: 

{18:33} And they shall scourge[him,] and put him to death: and the third day he shall rise again.

{18:34} And they understood none of these things: and this saying washid from them, neither knew they the things which were spoken.   

{18:35} And it came to pass, that as he was come nigh unto Jericho,a certain blind man sat by the way side begging: 

{18:36} And hearingthe multitude pass by, he asked what it meant. 

{18:37} And they toldhim, that Jesus of Nazareth passeth by. 

{18:38} And he cried, saying,Jesus, [thou] Son of David, have mercy on me. 

{18:39} And they whichwent before rebuked him, that he should hold his peace: but he cried somuch the more, [Thou] Son of David, have mercy on me. 

{18:40} And Jesusstood, and commanded him to be brought unto him: and when he was comenear, he asked him, 

{18:41} Saying, What wilt thou that I shall do untothee? And he said, Lord, that I may receive my sight. 

{18:42} And Jesussaid unto him, Receive thy sight: thy faith hath saved thee. 

{18:43}And immediately he received his sight, and followed him, glorifyingGod: and all the people, when they saw [it,] gave praise unto God.   

{19:1} And [Jesus] entered and passed through Jericho. 

{19:2} And,behold, [there was] a man named Zacchaeus, which was the chief amongthe publicans, and he was rich. 

{19:3} And he sought to see Jesus whohe was; and could not for the press, because he was little of stature.

{19:4} And he ran before, and climbed up into a sycomore tree to seehim: for he was to pass that [way. ]

{19:5} And when Jesus came to theplace, he looked up, and saw him, and said unto him, Zacchaeus, makehaste, and come down; for to day I must abide at thy house. 

{19:6} Andhe made haste, and came down, and received him joyfully. 

{19:7} Andwhen they saw [it,] they all murmured, saying, That he was gone to beguest with a man that is a sinner. 

{19:8} And Zacchaeus stood, and saidunto the Lord; Behold, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor;and if I have taken any thing from any man by false accusation, Irestore [him] fourfold. 

{19:9} And Jesus said unto him, This day issalvation come to this house, forsomuch as he also is a son of Abraham.

{19:10} For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which waslost. 

{19:11} And as they heard these things, he added and spake aparable, because he was nigh to Jerusalem, and because they thoughtthat the kingdom of God should immediately appear. 

{19:12} He saidtherefore, A certain nobleman went into a far country to receive forhimself a kingdom, and to return. 

{19:13} And he called his tenservants, and delivered them ten pounds, and said unto them, Occupytill I come. 

{19:14} But his citizens hated him, and sent a messageafter him, saying, We will not have this [man] to reign over us.

{19:15} And it came to pass, that when he was returned, having receivedthe kingdom, then he commanded these servants to be called unto him, towhom he had given the money, that he might know how much every man hadgained by trading. 

{19:16} Then came the first, saying, Lord, thy poundhath gained ten pounds. 

{19:17} And he said unto him, Well, thou goodservant: because thou hast been faithful in a very little, have thouauthority over ten cities. 

{19:18} And the second came, saying, Lord,thy pound hath gained five pounds. 

{19:19} And he said likewise to him,Be thou also over five cities. 

{19:20} And another came, saying, Lord,behold, [here is] thy pound, which I have kept laid up in a napkin:

{19:21} For I feared thee, because thou art an austere man: thou takestup that thou layedst not down, and reapest that thou didst not sow.

{19:22} And he saith unto him, Out of thine own mouth will I judgethee, [thou] wicked servant. Thou knewest that I was an austere man,taking up that I laid not down, and reaping that I did not sow: 

{19:23}Wherefore then gavest not thou my money into the bank, that at mycoming I might have required mine own with usury? 

{19:24} And he saidunto them that stood by, Take from him the pound, and give [it] to himthat hath ten pounds. 

{19:25} (And they said unto him, Lord, he hathten pounds.) 

{19:26} For I say unto you, That unto every one which hathshall be given; and from him that hath not, even that he hath shall betaken away from him. 

{19:27} But those mine enemies, which would notthat I should reign over them, bring hither, and slay [them] before me.   

{19:28} And when he had thus spoken, he went before, ascending up toJerusalem. 

{19:29} And it came to pass, when he was come nigh toBethphage and Bethany, at the mount called [the mount] of Olives, hesent two of his disciples, 

{19:30} Saying, Go ye into the village overagainst [you;] in the which at your entering ye shall find a colt tied,whereon yet never man sat: loose him, and bring [him hither. ]

{19:31}And if any man ask you, Why do ye loose [him?] thus shall ye say untohim, Because the Lord hath need of him. 

{19:32} And they that were sentwent their way, and found even as he had said unto them. 

{19:33} And asthey were loosing the colt, the owners thereof said unto them, Whyloose ye the colt? 

{19:34} And they said, The Lord hath need of him.

{19:35} And they brought him to Jesus: and they cast their garmentsupon the colt, and they set Jesus thereon. 

{19:36} And as he went, theyspread their clothes in the way. 

{19:37} And when he was come nigh,even now at the descent of the mount of Olives, the whole multitude ofthe disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for allthe mighty works that they had seen; 

{19:38} Saying, Blessed [be] theKing that cometh in the name of the Lord: peace in heaven, and glory inthe highest. 

{19:39} And some of the Pharisees from among the multitudesaid unto him, Master, rebuke thy disciples. 

{19:40} And he answeredand said unto them, I tell you that, if these should hold their peace,the stones would immediately cry out.   

{19:41} And when he was come near, he beheld the city, and wept overit, 

{19:42} Saying, If thou hadst known, even thou, at least in thisthy day, the things [which belong] unto thy peace! but now they are hidfrom thine eyes. 

{19:43} For the days shall come upon thee, that thineenemies shall cast a trench about thee, and compass thee round, andkeep thee in on every side, 

{19:44} And shall lay thee even with theground, and thy children within thee; and they shall not leave in theeone stone upon another; because thou knewest not the time of thyvisitation. 

{19:45} And he went into the temple, and began to cast outthem that sold therein, and them that bought; 

{19:46} Saying unto them,It is written, My house is the house of prayer: but ye have made it aden of thieves. 

{19:47} And he taught daily in the temple. But thechief priests and the scribes and the chief of the people sought todestroy him, 

{19:48} And could not find what they might do: for all thepeople were very attentive to hear him.   

{20:1} And it came to pass, [that] on one of those days, as hetaught the people in the temple, and preached the gospel, the chiefpriests and the scribes came upon [him] with the elders, 

{20:2} Andspake unto him, saying, Tell us, by what authority doest thou thesethings? or who is he that gave thee this authority? 

{20:3} And heanswered and said unto them, I will also ask you one thing; and answerme: 

{20:4} The baptism of John, was it from heaven, or of men? 

{20:5}And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, Fromheaven; he will say, Why then believed ye him not? 

{20:6} But and if wesay, Of men; all the people will stone us: for they be persuaded thatJohn was a prophet. 

{20:7} And they answered, that they could not tellwhence [it was. ]

{20:8} And Jesus said unto them, Neither tell I you bywhat authority I do these things. 

{20:9} Then began he to speak to thepeople this parable; A certain man planted a vineyard, and let it forthto husbandmen, and went into a far country for a long time. 

{20:10} Andat the season he sent a servant to the husbandmen, that they shouldgive him of the fruit of the vineyard: but the husbandmen beat him, andsent [him] away empty. 

{20:11} And again he sent another servant: andthey beat him also, and entreated [him] shamefully, and sent [him] awayempty. 

{20:12} And again he sent a third: and they wounded him also,and cast [him] out. 

{20:13} Then said the lord of the vineyard, Whatshall I do? I will send my beloved son: it may be they will reverence[him] when they see him. 

{20:14} But when the husbandmen saw him, theyreasoned among themselves, saying, This is the heir: come, let us killhim, that the inheritance may be ours. 

{20:15} So they cast him out ofthe vineyard, and killed [him.] What therefore shall the lord of thevineyard do unto them? 

{20:16} He shall come and destroy thesehusbandmen, and shall give the vineyard to others. And when they heard[it,] they said, God forbid. 

{20:17} And he beheld them, and said, Whatis this then that is written, The stone which the builders rejected,the same is become the head of the corner? 

{20:18} Whosoever shall fallupon that stone shall be broken; but on whomsoever it shall fall, itwill grind him to powder.   

{20:19} And the chief priests and the scribes the same hour soughtto lay hands on him; and they feared the people: for they perceivedthat he had spoken this parable against them. 

{20:20} And they watched[him,] and sent forth spies, which should feign themselves just men,that they might take hold of his words, that so they might deliver himunto the power and authority of the governor. 

{20:21} And they askedhim, saying, Master, we know that thou sayest and teachest rightly,neither acceptest thou the person [of any,] but teachest the way of Godtruly: 

{20:22} Is it lawful for us to give tribute unto Caesar, or no?

{20:23} But he perceived their craftiness, and said unto them, Whytempt ye me? 

{20:24} Shew me a penny. Whose image and superscriptionhath it? They answered and said, Caesar's. 

{20:25} And he said untothem, Render therefore unto Caesar the things which be Caesar's, andunto God the things which be God's. 

{20:26} And they could not takehold of his words before the people: and they marvelled at his answer,and held their peace.   

{20:27} Then came to [him] certain of the Sadducees, which deny thatthere is any resurrection; and they asked him, 

{20:28} Saying, Master,Moses wrote unto us, If any man's brother die, having a wife, and hedie without children, that his brother should take his wife, and raiseup seed unto his brother. 

{20:29} There were therefore seven brethren:and the first took a wife, and died without children. 

{20:30} And thesecond took her to wife, and he died childless. 

{20:31} And the thirdtook her; and in like manner the seven also: and they left no children,and died. 

{20:32} Last of all the woman died also. 

{20:33} Therefore inthe resurrection whose wife of them is she? for seven had her to wife.

{20:34} And Jesus answering said unto them, The children of this worldmarry, and are given in marriage: 

{20:35} But they which shall beaccounted worthy to obtain that world, and the resurrection from thedead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage: 

{20:36} Neither canthey die any more: for they are equal unto the angels; and are thechildren of God, being the children of the resurrection. 

{20:37} Nowthat the dead are raised, even Moses shewed at the bush, when hecalleth the Lord the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the Godof Jacob. 

{20:38} For he is not a God of the dead, but of the living:for all live unto him.   

{20:39} Then certain of the scribes answering said, Master, thouhast well said. 

{20:40} And after that they durst not ask him any[question at all. ]

{20:41} And he said unto them, How say they thatChrist is David's son? 

{20:42} And David himself saith in the book ofPsalms, The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 

{20:43}Till I make thine enemies thy footstool. 

{20:44} David thereforecalleth him Lord, how is he then his son?   

{20:45} Then in the audience of all the people he said unto hisdisciples, 

{20:46} Beware of the scribes, which desire to walk in longrobes, and love greetings in the markets, and the highest seats in thesynagogues, and the chief rooms at feasts; 

{20:47} Which devour widows'houses, and for a shew make long prayers: the same shall receivegreater damnation.   

{21:1} And he looked up, and saw the rich men casting their giftsinto the treasury. 

{21:2} And he saw also a certain poor widow castingin thither two mites. 

{21:3} And he said, Of a truth I say unto you,that this poor widow hath cast in more than they all: 

{21:4} For allthese have of their abundance cast in unto the offerings of God: butshe of her penury hath cast in all the living that she had.   

{21:5} And as some spake of the temple, how it was adorned withgoodly stones and gifts, he said, 

{21:6} [As for] these things which yebehold, the days will come, in the which there shall not be left onestone upon another, that shall not be thrown down. 

{21:7} And theyasked him, saying, Master, but when shall these things be? and whatsign [will there be] when these things shall come to pass? 

{21:8} Andhe said, Take heed that ye be not deceived: for many shall come in myname, saying, I am [Christ;] and the time draweth near: go ye nottherefore after them. 

{21:9} But when ye shall hear of wars andcommotions, be not terrified: for these things must first come to pass;but the end [is] not by and by. 

{21:10} Then said he unto them, Nationshall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: 

{21:11} Andgreat earthquakes shall be in divers places, and famines, andpestilences; and fearful sights and great signs shall there be fromheaven. 

{21:12} But before all these, they shall lay their hands onyou, and persecute [you,] delivering [you] up to the synagogues, andinto prisons, being brought before kings and rulers for my name's sake.

{21:13} And it shall turn to you for a testimony. 

{21:14} Settle [it]therefore in your hearts, not to meditate before what ye shall answer:

{21:15} For I will give you a mouth and wisdom, which all youradversaries shall not be able to gainsay nor resist. 

{21:16} And yeshall be betrayed both by parents, and brethren, and kinsfolks, andfriends; and [some] of you shall they cause to be put to death. 

{21:17}And ye shall be hated of all [men] for my name's sake. 

{21:18} Butthere shall not an hair of your head perish. 

{21:19} In your patiencepossess ye your souls. 

{21:20} And when ye shall see Jerusalemcompassed with armies, then know that the desolation thereof is nigh.

{21:21} Then let them which are in Judaea flee to the mountains; andlet them which are in the midst of it depart out; and let not them thatare in the countries enter thereinto. 

{21:22} For these be the days ofvengeance, that all things which are written may be fulfilled. 

{21:23}But woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give suck, inthose days! for there shall be great distress in the land, and wrathupon this people. 

{21:24} And they shall fall by the edge of the sword,and shall be led away captive into all nations: and Jerusalem shall betrodden down of the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles befulfilled.   

{21:25} And there shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and inthe stars; and upon the earth distress of nations, with perplexity; thesea and the waves roaring; 

{21:26} Men's hearts failing them for fear,and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth: forthe powers of heaven shall be shaken. 

{21:27} And then shall they seethe Son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory. 

{21:28}And when these things begin to come to pass, then look up, and lift upyour heads; for your redemption draweth nigh. 

{21:29} And he spake tothem a parable; Behold the fig tree, and all the trees; 

{21:30} Whenthey now shoot forth, ye see and know of your own selves that summer isnow nigh at hand. 

{21:31} So likewise ye, when ye see these things cometo pass, know ye that the kingdom of God is nigh at hand. 

{21:32}Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass away, till all befulfilled. 

{21:33} Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shallnot pass away.   

{21:34} And take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts beovercharged with surfeiting, and drunkenness, and cares of this life,and so that day come upon you unawares. 

{21:35} For as a snare shall itcome on all them that dwell on the face of the whole earth. 

{21:36}Watch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye may be accounted worthy toescape all these things that shall come to pass, and to stand beforethe Son of man. 

{21:37} And in the day time he was teaching in thetemple; and at night he went out, and abode in the mount that is called[the mount] of Olives. 

{21:38} And all the people came early in themorning to him in the temple, for to hear him.   

{22:1} Now the feast of unleavened bread drew nigh, which is calledthe Passover. 

{22:2} And the chief priests and scribes sought how theymight kill him; for they feared the people.   

{22:3} Then entered Satan into Judas surnamed Iscariot, being of thenumber of the twelve. 

{22:4} And he went his way, and communed with thechief priests and captains, how he might betray him unto them. 

{22:5}And they were glad, and covenanted to give him money. 

{22:6} And hepromised, and sought opportunity to betray him unto them in the absenceof the multitude.   

{22:7} Then came the day of unleavened bread, when the passover mustbe killed. 

{22:8} And he sent Peter and John, saying, Go and prepare usthe passover, that we may eat. 

{22:9} And they said unto him, Wherewilt thou that we prepare? 

{22:10} And he said unto them, Behold, whenye are entered into the city, there shall a man meet you, bearing apitcher of water; follow him into the house where he entereth in.

{22:11} And ye shall say unto the goodman of the house, The Mastersaith unto thee, Where is the guestchamber, where I shall eat thepassover with my disciples? 

{22:12} And he shall shew you a large upperroom furnished: there make ready. 

{22:13} And they went, and found ashe had said unto them: and they made ready the passover. 

{22:14} Andwhen the hour was come, he sat down, and the twelve apostles with him.

{22:15} And he said unto them, With desire I have desired to eat thispassover with you before I suffer: 

{22:16} For I say unto you, I willnot any more eat thereof, until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of God.

{22:17} And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and said, Take this, anddivide [it] among yourselves: 

{22:18} For I say unto you, I will notdrink of the fruit of the vine, until the kingdom of God shall come.   

{22:19} And he took bread, and gave thanks, and brake [it,] and gaveunto them, saying, This is my body which is given for you: this do inremembrance of me. 

{22:20} Likewise also the cup after supper, saying,This cup [is] the new testament in my blood, which is shed for you.   

{22:21} But, behold, the hand of him that betrayeth me [is] with meon the table. 

{22:22} And truly the Son of man goeth, as it wasdetermined: but woe unto that man by whom he is betrayed! 

{22:23} Andthey began to enquire among themselves, which of them it was thatshould do this thing.   

{22:24} And there was also a strife among them, which of them shouldbe accounted the greatest. 

{22:25} And he said unto them, The kings ofthe Gentiles exercise lordship over them; and they that exerciseauthority upon them are called benefactors. 

{22:26} But ye [shall] not[be] so: but he that is greatest among you, let him be as the younger;and he that is chief, as he that doth serve. 

{22:27} For whether [is]greater, he that sitteth at meat, or he that serveth? [is] not he thatsitteth at meat? but I am among you as he that serveth. 

{22:28} Ye arethey which have continued with me in my temptations. 

{22:29} And Iappoint unto you a kingdom, as my Father hath appointed unto me;

{22:30} That ye may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, and sit onthrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.   

{22:31} And the Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold, Satan hath desired[to have] you, that he may sift [you] as wheat: 

{22:32} But I haveprayed for thee, that thy faith fail not: and when thou art converted,strengthen thy brethren. 

{22:33} And he said unto him, Lord, I am readyto go with thee, both into prison, and to death. 

{22:34} And he said, Itell thee, Peter, the cock shall not crow this day, before that thoushalt thrice deny that thou knowest me. 

{22:35} And he said unto them,When I sent you without purse, and scrip, and shoes, lacked ye anything? And they said, Nothing. 

{22:36} Then said he unto them, But now,he that hath a purse, let him take [it,] and likewise [his] scrip: andhe that hath no sword, let him sell his garment, and buy one. 

{22:37}For I say unto you, that this that is written must yet be accomplishedin me, And he was reckoned among the transgressors: for the thingsconcerning me have an end. 

{22:38} And they said, Lord, behold, here[are] two swords. And he said unto them, It is enough.   

{22:39} And he came out, and went, as he was wont, to the mount ofOlives; and his disciples also followed him. 

{22:40} And when he was atthe place, he said unto them, Pray that ye enter not into temptation.

{22:41} And he was withdrawn from them about a stone's cast, andkneeled down, and prayed, 

{22:42} Saying, Father, if thou be willing,remove this cup from me: nevertheless not my will, but thine, be done.

{22:43} And there appeared an angel unto him from heaven, strengtheninghim. 

{22:44} And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly: and hissweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground.

{22:45} And when he rose up from prayer, and was come to his disciples,he found them sleeping for sorrow, 

{22:46} And said unto them, Whysleep ye? rise and pray, lest ye enter into temptation.   

{22:47} And while he yet spake, behold a multitude, and he that wascalled Judas, one of the twelve, went before them, and drew near untoJesus to kiss him. 

{22:48} But Jesus said unto him, Judas, betrayestthou the Son of man with a kiss? 

{22:49} When they which were about himsaw what would follow, they said unto him, Lord, shall we smite withthe sword?   

{22:50} And one of them smote the servant of the high priest, andcut off his right ear. 

{22:51} And Jesus answered and said, Suffer yethus far. And he touched his ear, and healed him. 

{22:52} Then Jesussaid unto the chief priests, and captains of the temple, and theelders, which were come to him, Be ye come out, as against a thief,with swords and staves? 

{22:53} When I was daily with you in thetemple, ye stretched forth no hands against me: but this is your hour,and the power of darkness.   

{22:54} Then took they him, and led [him,] and brought him into thehigh priest's house. And Peter followed afar off. 

{22:55} And when theyhad kindled a fire in the midst of the hall, and were set downtogether, Peter sat down among them. 

{22:56} But a certain maid beheldhim as he sat by the fire, and earnestly looked upon him, and said,This man was also with him. 

{22:57} And he denied him, saying, Woman, Iknow him not. 

{22:58} And after a little while another saw him, andsaid, Thou art also of them. And Peter said, Man, I am not. 

{22:59} Andabout the space of one hour after another confidently affirmed, saying,Of a truth this [fellow] also was with him: for he is a Galilaean.

{22:60} And Peter said, Man, I know not what thou sayest. Andimmediately, while he yet spake, the cock crew. 

{22:61} And the Lordturned, and looked upon Peter. And Peter remembered the word of theLord, how he had said unto him, Before the cock crow, thou shalt denyme thrice. 

{22:62} And Peter went out, and wept bitterly.   

{22:63} And the men that held Jesus mocked him, and smote [him.]

{22:64} And when they had blindfolded him, they struck him on theface, and asked him, saying, Prophesy, who is it that smote thee?

{22:65} And many other things blasphemously spake they against him.   

{22:66} And as soon as it was day, the elders of the people and thechief priests and the scribes came together, and led him into theircouncil, saying, 

{22:67} Art thou the Christ? tell us. And he said untothem, If I tell you, ye will not believe: 

{22:68} And if I also ask[you,] ye will not answer me, nor let [me] go. 

{22:69} Hereafter shallthe Son of man sit on the right hand of the power of God. 

{22:70} Thensaid they all, Art thou then the Son of God? And he said unto them, Yesay that I am. 

{22:71} And they said, What need we any further witness?for we ourselves have heard of his own mouth.   

{23:1} And the whole multitude of them arose, and led him untoPilate. 

{23:2} And they began to accuse him, saying, We found this[fellow] perverting the nation, and forbidding to give tribute toCaesar, saying that he himself is Christ a King. 

{23:3} And Pilateasked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answered himand said, Thou sayest [it. ]

{23:4} Then said Pilate to the chiefpriests and [to] the people, I find no fault in this man. 

{23:5} Andthey were the more fierce, saying, He stirreth up the people, teachingthroughout all Jewry, beginning from Galilee to this place. 

{23:6} WhenPilate heard of Galilee, he asked whether the man were a Galilaean.

{23:7} And as soon as he knew that he belonged unto Herod'sjurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who himself also was at Jerusalemat that time.   

{23:8} And when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceeding glad: for he wasdesirous to see him of a long [season,] because he had heard manythings of him; and he hoped to have seen some miracle done by him.

{23:9} Then he questioned with him in many words; but he answered himnothing. 

{23:10} And the chief priests and scribes stood and vehementlyaccused him. 

{23:11} And Herod with his men of war set him at nought,and mocked [him,] and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe, and sent himagain to Pilate.   

{23:12} And the same day Pilate and Herod were made friendstogether: for before they were at enmity between themselves.   

{23:13} And Pilate, when he had called together the chief priestsand the rulers and the people, 

{23:14} Said unto them, Ye have broughtthis man unto me, as one that perverteth the people: and, behold, I,having examined [him] before you, have found no fault in this mantouching those things whereof ye accuse him: 

{23:15} No, nor yet Herod:for I sent you to him; and, lo, nothing worthy of death is done untohim. 

{23:16} I will therefore chastise him, and release [him. ]

{23:17}(For of necessity he must release one unto them at the feast.) 

{23:18}And they cried out all at once, saying, Away with this [man,] andrelease unto us Barabbas: 

{23:19} (Who for a certain sedition made inthe city, and for murder, was cast into prison.) 

{23:20} Pilatetherefore, willing to release Jesus, spake again to them. 

{23:21} Butthey cried, saying, Crucify [him,] crucify him. 

{23:22} And he saidunto them the third time, Why, what evil hath he done? I have found nocause of death in him: I will therefore chastise him, and let [him] go.

{23:23} And they were instant with loud voices, requiring that he mightbe crucified. And the voices of them and of the chief priestsprevailed. 

{23:24} And Pilate gave sentence that it should be as theyrequired. 

{23:25} And he released unto them him that for sedition andmurder was cast into prison, whom they had desired; but he deliveredJesus to their will. 

{23:26} And as they led him away, they laid holdupon one Simon, a Cyrenian, coming out of the country, and on him theylaid the cross, that he might bear [it] after Jesus.   

{23:27} And there followed him a great company of people, and ofwomen, which also bewailed and lamented him. 

{23:28} But Jesus turningunto them said, Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep foryourselves, and for your children. 

{23:29} For, behold, the days arecoming, in the which they shall say, Blessed [are] the barren, and thewombs that never bare, and the paps which never gave suck. 

{23:30} Thenshall they begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us; and to the hills,Cover us. 

{23:31} For if they do these things in a green tree, whatshall be done in the dry? 

{23:32} And there were also two others,malefactors, led with him to be put to death. 

{23:33} And when theywere come to the place, which is called Calvary, there they crucifiedhim, and the malefactors, one on the right hand, and the other on theleft.   

{23:34} Then said Jesus, Father, forgive them; for they know notwhat they do. And they parted his raiment, and cast lots. 

{23:35} Andthe people stood beholding. And the rulers also with them derided[him,] saying, He saved others; let him save himself, if he be Christ,the chosen of God. 

{23:36} And the soldiers also mocked him, coming tohim, and offering him vinegar, 

{23:37} And saying, If thou be the kingof the Jews, save thyself. 

{23:38} And a superscription also waswritten over him in letters of Greek, and Latin, and Hebrew, THIS ISTHE KING OF THE JEWS.   

{23:39} And one of the malefactors which were hanged railed on him,saying, If thou be Christ, save thyself and us. 

{23:40} But the otheranswering rebuked him, saying, Dost not thou fear God, seeing thou artin the same condemnation? 

{23:41} And we indeed justly; for we receivethe due reward of our deeds: but this man hath done nothing amiss.

{23:42} And he said unto Jesus, Lord, remember me when thou comest intothy kingdom. 

{23:43} And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee,To day shalt thou be with me in paradise. 

{23:44} And it was about thesixth hour, and there was a darkness over all the earth until the ninthhour. 

{23:45} And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple wasrent in the midst.   

{23:46} And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, Father,into thy hands I commend my spirit: and having said thus, he gave upthe ghost. 

{23:47} Now when the centurion saw what was done, heglorified God, saying, Certainly this was a righteous man. 

{23:48} Andall the people that came together to that sight, beholding the thingswhich were done, smote their breasts, and returned. 

{23:49} And all hisacquaintance, and the women that followed him from Galilee, stood afaroff, beholding these things.   

{23:50} And, behold, [there was] a man named Joseph, a counsellor;[and he was] a good man, and a just: 

{23:51} (The same had notconsented to the counsel and deed of them;) [he was] of Arimathaea, acity of the Jews: who also himself waited for the kingdom of God.

{23:52} This [man] went unto Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus.

{23:53} And he took it down, and wrapped it in linen, and laid it in asepulchre that was hewn in stone, wherein never man before was laid.

{23:54} And that day was the preparation, and the sabbath drew on.

{23:55} And the women also, which came with him from Galilee, followedafter, and beheld the sepulchre, and how his body was laid. 

{23:56} Andthey returned, and prepared spices and ointments; and rested thesabbath day according to the commandment.   

{24:1} Now upon the first [day] of the week, very early in themorning, they came unto the sepulchre, bringing the spices which theyhad prepared, and certain [others] with them. 

{24:2} And they found thestone rolled away from the sepulchre. 

{24:3} And they entered in, andfound not the body of the Lord Jesus. 

{24:4} And it came to pass, asthey were much perplexed thereabout, behold, two men stood by them inshining garments: 

{24:5} And as they were afraid, and bowed down[their] faces to the earth, they said unto them, Why seek ye the livingamong the dead? 

{24:6} He is not here, but is risen: remember how hespake unto you when he was yet in Galilee, 

{24:7} Saying, The Son ofman must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified,and the third day rise again. 

{24:8} And they remembered his words,

{24:9} And returned from the sepulchre, and told all these things untothe eleven, and to all the rest. 

{24:10} It was Mary Magdalene, andJoanna, and Mary [the mother] of James, and other [women that were]with them, which told these things unto the apostles. 

{24:11} And theirwords seemed to them as idle tales, and they believed them not. 

{24:12}Then arose Peter, and ran unto the sepulchre; and stooping down, hebeheld the linen clothes laid by themselves, and departed, wondering inhimself at that which was come to pass.   

{24:13} And, behold, two of them went that same day to a villagecalled Emmaus, which was from Jerusalem [about] threescore furlongs.

{24:14} And they talked together of all these things which hadhappened. 

{24:15} And it came to pass, that, while they communed[together] and reasoned, Jesus himself drew near, and went with them.

{24:16} But their eyes were holden that they should not know him.

{24:17} And he said unto them, What manner of communications [are]these that ye have one to another, as ye walk, and are sad? 

{24:18} Andthe one of them, whose name was Cleopas, answering said unto him, Artthou only a stranger in Jerusalem, and hast not known the things whichare come to pass there in these days? 

{24:19} And he said unto them,What things? And they said unto him, Concerning Jesus of Nazareth,which was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all thepeople: 

{24:20} And how the chief priests and our rulers delivered himto be condemned to death, and have crucified him. 

{24:21} But wetrusted that it had been he which should have redeemed Israel: andbeside all this, to day is the third day since these things were done.

{24:22} Yea, and certain women also of our company made us astonished,which were early at the sepulchre; 

{24:23} And when they found not hisbody, they came, saying, that they had also seen a vision of angels,which said that he was alive. 

{24:24} And certain of them which werewith us went to the sepulchre, and found [it] even so as the women hadsaid: but him they saw not. 

{24:25} Then he said unto them, O fools,and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken: 

{24:26}Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and to enter into hisglory? 

{24:27} And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, heexpounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerninghimself. 

{24:28} And they drew nigh unto the village, whither theywent: and he made as though he would have gone further. 

{24:29} Butthey constrained him, saying, Abide with us: for it is toward evening,and the day is far spent. And he went in to tarry with them. 

{24:30}And it came to pass, as he sat at meat with them, he took bread, andblessed [it,] and brake, and gave to them. 

{24:31} And their eyes wereopened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of their sight. 

{24:32}And they said one to another, Did not our heart burn within us, whilehe talked with us by the way, and while he opened to us the scriptures?

{24:33} And they rose up the same hour, and returned to Jerusalem, andfound the eleven gathered together, and them that were with them,

{24:34} Saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon.

{24:35} And they told what things [were done] in the way, and how hewas known of them in breaking of bread.   

{24:36} And as they thus spake, Jesus himself stood in the midst ofthem, and saith unto them, Peace [be] unto you. 

{24:37} But they wereterrified and affrighted, and supposed that they had seen a spirit.

{24:38} And he said unto them, Why are ye troubled? and why do thoughtsarise in your hearts? 

{24:39} Behold my hands and my feet, that it is Imyself: handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, asye see me have. 

{24:40} And when he had thus spoken, he shewed them[his] hands and [his] feet. 

{24:41} And while they yet believed not forjoy, and wondered, he said unto them, Have ye here any meat? 

{24:42}And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish, and of an honeycomb.

{24:43} And he took [it,] and did eat before them. 

{24:44} And he saidunto them, These [are] the words which I spake unto you, while I wasyet with you, that all things must be fulfilled, which were written inthe law of Moses, and [in] the prophets, and [in] the psalms,concerning me. 

{24:45} Then opened he their understanding, that theymight understand the scriptures, 

{24:46} And said unto them, Thus it iswritten, and thus it behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise from thedead the third day: 

{24:47} And that repentance and remission of sinsshould be preached in his name among all nations, beginning atJerusalem. 

{24:48} And ye are witnesses of these things.   

{24:49} And, behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you: buttarry ye in the city of Jerusalem, until ye be endued with power fromon high.   

{24:50} And he led them out as far as to Bethany, and he lifted uphis hands, and blessed them. 

{24:51} And it came to pass, while heblessed them, he was parted from them, and carried up into heaven.

{24:52} And they worshipped him, and returned to Jerusalem with greatjoy: 

{24:53} And were continually in the temple, praising and blessingGod. Amen.
