{The Book of Job   

{1:1} There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name [was] Job; andthat man was perfect and upright, and one that feared God, and eschewedevil. 

{1:2} And there were born unto him seven sons and threedaughters. 

{1:3} His substance also was seven thousand sheep, and threethousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred sheasses, and a very great household; so that this man was the greatest ofall the men of the east. 

{1:4} And his sons went and feasted [in their]houses, every one his day; and sent and called for their three sistersto eat and to drink with them. 

{1:5} And it was so, when the days of[their] feasting were gone about, that Job sent and sanctified them,and rose up early in the morning, and offered burnt offerings[according] to the number of them all: for Job said, It may be that mysons have sinned, and cursed God in their hearts. Thus did Jobcontinually.   

{1:6} Now there was a day when the sons of God came to presentthemselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them. 

{1:7} Andthe LORD said unto Satan, Whence comest thou? Then Satan answered theLORD, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking upand down in it. 

{1:8} And the LORD said unto Satan, Hast thouconsidered my servant Job, that [there is] none like him in the earth,a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil?

{1:9} Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, Doth Job fear God fornought? 

{1:10} Hast not thou made an hedge about him, and about hishouse, and about all that he hath on every side? thou hast blessed thework of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land. 

{1:11}But put forth thine hand now, and touch all that he hath, and he willcurse thee to thy face. 

{1:12} And the LORD said unto Satan, Behold,all that he hath [is] in thy power; only upon himself put not forththine hand. So Satan went forth from the presence of the LORD.   

{1:13} And there was a day when his sons and his daughters [were]eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house: 

{1:14} Andthere came a messenger unto Job, and said, The oxen were plowing, andthe asses feeding beside them: 

{1:15} And the Sabeans fell [upon them,]and took them away; yea, they have slain the servants with the edge ofthe sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee. 

{1:16} While he[was] yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The fire of Godis fallen from heaven, and hath burned up the sheep, and the servants,and consumed them; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee. 

{1:17}While he [was] yet speaking, there came also another, and said, TheChaldeans made out three bands, and fell upon the camels, and havecarried them away, yea, and slain the servants with the edge of thesword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee. 

{1:18} While he [was]yet speaking, there came also another, and said, Thy sons and thydaughters [were] eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother'shouse: 

{1:19} And, behold, there came a great wind from the wilderness,and smote the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the youngmen, and they are dead; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.

{1:20} Then Job arose, and rent his mantle, and shaved his head, andfell down upon the ground, and worshipped, 

{1:21} And said, Naked cameI out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return thither: the LORDgave, and the LORD hath taken away; blessed be the name of the LORD.

{1:22} In all this Job sinned not, nor charged God foolishly.   

{2:1} Again there was a day when the sons of God came to presentthemselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them to presenthimself before the LORD. 

{2:2} And the LORD said unto Satan, Fromwhence comest thou? And Satan answered the LORD, and said, From goingto and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it. 

{2:3} Andthe LORD said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that[there is] none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man,one that feareth God, and escheweth evil? and still he holdeth fast hisintegrity, although thou movedst me against him, to destroy him withoutcause. 

{2:4} And Satan answered the LORD, and said, Skin for skin, yea,all that a man hath will he give for his life. 

{2:5} But put forththine hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will cursethee to thy face. 

{2:6} And the LORD said unto Satan, Behold, he [is]in thine hand; but save his life.   

{2:7} So went Satan forth from the presence of the LORD, and smoteJob with sore boils from the sole of his foot unto his crown. 

{2:8} Andhe took him a potsherd to scrape himself withal; and he sat down amongthe ashes.   

{2:9} Then said his wife unto him, Dost thou still retain thineintegrity? curse God, and die. 

{2:10} But he said unto her, Thouspeakest as one of the foolish women speaketh. What? shall we receivegood at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil? In all this didnot Job sin with his lips.   

{2:11} Now when Job's three friends heard of all this evil that wascome upon him, they came every one from his own place; Eliphaz theTemanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite: for theyhad made an appointment together to come to mourn with him and tocomfort him. 

{2:12} And when they lifted up their eyes afar off, andknew him not, they lifted up their voice, and wept; and they rent everyone his mantle, and sprinkled dust upon their heads toward heaven.

{2:13} So they sat down with him upon the ground seven days and sevennights, and none spake a word unto him: for they saw that [his] griefwas very great.   

{3:1} After this opened Job his mouth, and cursed his day. 

{3:2} AndJob spake, and said, 

{3:3} Let the day perish wherein I was born, andthe night [in which] it was said, There is a man child conceived. 

{3:4}Let that day be darkness; let not God regard it from above, neither letthe light shine upon it. 

{3:5} Let darkness and the shadow of deathstain it; let a cloud dwell upon it; let the blackness of the dayterrify it. 

{3:6} As [for] that night, let darkness seize upon it; letit not be joined unto the days of the year, let it not come into thenumber of the months. 

{3:7} Lo, let that night be solitary, let nojoyful voice come therein. 

{3:8} Let them curse it that curse the day,who are ready to raise up their mourning. 

{3:9} Let the stars of thetwilight thereof be dark; let it look for light, but [have] none;neither let it see the dawning of the day: 

{3:10} Because it shut notup the doors of my [mother's] womb, nor hid sorrow from mine eyes.

{3:11} Why died I not from the womb? [why] did I [not] give up theghost when I came out of the belly? 

{3:12} Why did the knees preventme? or why the breasts that I should suck? 

{3:13} For now should I havelain still and been quiet, I should have slept: then had I been atrest, 

{3:14} With kings and counsellors of the earth, which builtdesolate places for themselves; 

{3:15} Or with princes that had gold,who filled their houses with silver: 

{3:16} Or as an hidden untimelybirth I had not been; as infants [which] never saw light. 

{3:17} Therethe wicked cease [from] troubling; and there the weary be at rest.

{3:18} [There] the prisoners rest together; they hear not the voice ofthe oppressor. 

{3:19} The small and great are there; and the servant[is] free from his master. 

{3:20} Wherefore is light given to him thatis in misery, and life unto the bitter [in] soul; 

{3:21} Which long fordeath, but it [cometh] not; and dig for it more than for hid treasures;

{3:22} Which rejoice exceedingly, [and] are glad, when they can findthe grave? 

{3:23} [Why is light given] to a man whose way is hid, andwhom God hath hedged in? 

{3:24} For my sighing cometh before I eat, andmy roarings are poured out like the waters. 

{3:25} For the thing whichI greatly feared is come upon me, and that which I was afraid of iscome unto me. 

{3:26} I was not in safety, neither had I rest, neitherwas I quiet; yet trouble came.   

{4:1} Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said, 

{4:2} [If] weassay to commune with thee, wilt thou be grieved? but who can withholdhimself from speaking? 

{4:3} Behold, thou hast instructed many, andthou hast strengthened the weak hands. 

{4:4} Thy words have upholdenhim that was falling, and thou hast strengthened the feeble knees.

{4:5} But now it is come upon thee, and thou faintest; it toucheththee, and thou art troubled. 

{4:6} [Is] not [this] thy fear, thyconfidence, thy hope, and the uprightness of thy ways? 

{4:7} Remember,I pray thee, who [ever] perished, being innocent? or where were therighteous cut off? 

{4:8} Even as I have seen, they that plow iniquity,and sow wickedness, reap the same. 

{4:9} By the blast of God theyperish, and by the breath of his nostrils are they consumed. 

{4:10} Theroaring of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion, and the teeth ofthe young lions, are broken. 

{4:11} The old lion perisheth for lack ofprey, and the stout lion's whelps are scattered abroad. 

{4:12} Now athing was secretly brought to me, and mine ear received a littlethereof. 

{4:13} In thoughts from the visions of the night, when deepsleep falleth on men, 

{4:14} Fear came upon me, and trembling, whichmade all my bones to shake. 

{4:15} Then a spirit passed before my face;the hair of my flesh stood up: 

{4:16} It stood still, but I could notdiscern the form thereof: an image [was] before mine eyes, [there was]silence, and I heard a voice, [saying, ]

{4:17} Shall mortal man be morejust than God? shall a man be more pure than his maker? 

{4:18} Behold,he put no trust in his servants; and his angels he charged with folly:

{4:19} How much less [in] them that dwell in houses of clay, whosefoundation [is] in the dust, [which] are crushed before the moth?

{4:20} They are destroyed from morning to evening: they perish for everwithout any regarding [it. ]

{4:21} Doth not their excellency [which is]in them go away? they die, even without wisdom.   

{5:1} Call now, if there be any that will answer thee; and to whichof the saints wilt thou turn? 

{5:2} For wrath killeth the foolish man,and envy slayeth the silly one. 

{5:3} I have seen the foolish takingroot: but suddenly I cursed his habitation. 

{5:4} His children are farfrom safety, and they are crushed in the gate, neither [is there] anyto deliver [them. ]

{5:5} Whose harvest the hungry eateth up, and takethit even out of the thorns, and the robber swalloweth up theirsubstance. 

{5:6} Although affliction cometh not forth of the dust,neither doth trouble spring out of the ground; 

{5:7} Yet man is bornunto trouble, as the sparks fly upward. 

{5:8} I would seek unto God,and unto God would I commit my cause: 

{5:9} Which doeth great thingsand unsearchable; marvellous things without number: 

{5:10} Who givethrain upon the earth, and sendeth waters upon the fields: 

{5:11} To setup on high those that be low; that those which mourn may be exalted tosafety. 

{5:12} He disappointeth the devices of the crafty, so thattheir hands cannot perform [their] enterprise. 

{5:13} He taketh thewise in their own craftiness: and the counsel of the froward is carriedheadlong. 

{5:14} They meet with darkness in the daytime, and grope inthe noonday as in the night. 

{5:15} But he saveth the poor from thesword, from their mouth, and from the hand of the mighty. 

{5:16} So thepoor hath hope, and iniquity stoppeth her mouth. 

{5:17} Behold, happy[is] the man whom God correcteth: therefore despise not thou thechastening of the Almighty: 

{5:18} For he maketh sore, and bindeth up:he woundeth, and his hands make whole. 

{5:19} He shall deliver thee insix troubles: yea, in seven there shall no evil touch thee. 

{5:20} Infamine he shall redeem thee from death: and in war from the power ofthe sword. 

{5:21} Thou shalt be hid from the scourge of the tongue:neither shalt thou be afraid of destruction when it cometh. 

{5:22} Atdestruction and famine thou shalt laugh: neither shalt thou be afraidof the beasts of the earth. 

{5:23} For thou shalt be in league with thestones of the field: and the beasts of the field shall be at peace withthee. 

{5:24} And thou shalt know that thy tabernacle [shall be] inpeace; and thou shalt visit thy habitation, and shalt not sin. 

{5:25}Thou shalt know also that thy seed [shall be] great, and thineoffspring as the grass of the earth. 

{5:26} Thou shalt come to [thy]grave in a full age, like as a shock of corn cometh in in his season.

{5:27} Lo this, we have searched it, so it [is;] hear it, and know thou[it] for thy good.   

{6:1} But Job answered and said, 

{6:2} O that my grief werethroughly weighed, and my calamity laid in the balances together! 

{6:3}For now it would be heavier than the sand of the sea: therefore mywords are swallowed up. 

{6:4} For the arrows of the Almighty [are]within me, the poison whereof drinketh up my spirit: the terrors of Goddo set themselves in array against me. 

{6:5} Doth the wild ass braywhen he hath grass? or loweth the ox over his fodder? 

{6:6} Can thatwhich is unsavoury be eaten without salt? or is there [any] taste inthe white of an egg? 

{6:7} The things [that] my soul refused to touch[are] as my sorrowful meat. 

{6:8} Oh that I might have my request; andthat God would grant [me] the thing that I long for! 

{6:9} Even that itwould please God to destroy me; that he would let loose his hand, andcut me off! 

{6:10} Then should I yet have comfort; yea, I would hardenmyself in sorrow: let him not spare; for I have not concealed the wordsof the Holy One. 

{6:11} What [is] my strength, that I should hope? andwhat [is] mine end, that I should prolong my life? 

{6:12} [Is] mystrength the strength of stones? or [is] my flesh of brass? 

{6:13} [Is]not my help in me? and is wisdom driven quite from me? 

{6:14} To himthat is afflicted pity [should be shewed] from his friend; but heforsaketh the fear of the Almighty. 

{6:15} My brethren have dealtdeceitfully as a brook, [and] as the stream of brooks they pass away;

{6:16} Which are blackish by reason of the ice, [and] wherein the snowis hid: 

{6:17} What time they wax warm, they vanish: when it is hot,they are consumed out of their place. 

{6:18} The paths of their way areturned aside; they go to nothing, and perish. 

{6:19} The troops of Temalooked, the companies of Sheba waited for them. 

{6:20} They wereconfounded because they had hoped; they came thither, and were ashamed.

{6:21} For now ye are no thing; ye see [my] casting down, and areafraid. 

{6:22} Did I say, Bring unto me? or, Give a reward for me ofyour substance? 

{6:23} Or, Deliver me from the enemy's hand? or, Redeemme from the hand of the mighty? 

{6:24} Teach me, and I will hold mytongue: and cause me to understand wherein I have erred. 

{6:25} Howforcible are right words! but what doth your arguing reprove? 

{6:26} Doye imagine to reprove words, and the speeches of one that is desperate,[which are] as wind? 

{6:27} Yea, ye overwhelm the fatherless, and yedig [a pit] for your friend. 

{6:28} Now therefore be content, look uponme; for [it is] evident unto you if I lie. 

{6:29} Return, I pray you,let it not be iniquity; yea, return again, my righteousness [is] in it.

{6:30} Is there iniquity in my tongue? cannot my taste discern perversethings?   

{7:1} [Is there] not an appointed time to man upon earth? [are not]his days also like the days of an hireling? 

{7:2} As a servantearnestly desireth the shadow, and as an hireling looketh for [thereward of] his work: 

{7:3} So am I made to possess months of vanity,and wearisome nights are appointed to me. 

{7:4} When I lie down, I say,When shall I arise, and the night be gone? and I am full of tossings toand fro unto the dawning of the day. 

{7:5} My flesh is clothed withworms and clods of dust; my skin is broken, and become loathsome. 

{7:6}My days are swifter than a weaver's shuttle, and are spent withouthope. 

{7:7} O remember that my life is wind: mine eye shall no more seegood. 

{7:8} The eye of him that hath seen me shall see me no [more:]thine eyes [are] upon me, and I [am] not. 

{7:9} [As] the cloud isconsumed and vanisheth away: so he that goeth down to the grave shallcome up no [more. ]

{7:10} He shall return no more to his house, neithershall his place know him any more. 

{7:11} Therefore I will not refrainmy mouth; I will speak in the anguish of my spirit; I will complain inthe bitterness of my soul. 

{7:12} [Am] I a sea, or a whale, that thousettest a watch over me? 

{7:13} When I say, My bed shall comfort me, mycouch shall ease my complaint; 

{7:14} Then thou scarest me with dreams,and terrifiest me through visions: 

{7:15} So that my soul choosethstrangling, [and] death rather than my life. 

{7:16} I loathe [it;] Iwould not live alway: let me alone; for my days [are] vanity. 

{7:17}What [is] man, that thou shouldest magnify him? and that thou shouldestset thine heart upon him? 

{7:18} And [that] thou shouldest visit himevery morning, [and] try him every moment? 

{7:19} How long wilt thounot depart from me, nor let me alone till I swallow down my spittle?

{7:20} I have sinned; what shall I do unto thee, O thou preserver ofmen? why hast thou set me as a mark against thee, so that I am a burdento myself? 

{7:21} And why dost thou not pardon my transgression, andtake away mine iniquity? for now shall I sleep in the dust; and thoushalt seek me in the morning, but I [shall] not [be.]   

{8:1} Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said, 

{8:2} How longwilt thou speak these [things?] and [how long shall] the words of thymouth be like a strong wind? 

{8:3} Doth God pervert judgment? or doththe Almighty pervert justice? 

{8:4} If thy children have sinned againsthim, and he have cast them away for their transgression; 

{8:5} If thouwouldest seek unto God betimes, and make thy supplication to theAlmighty; 

{8:6} If thou [wert] pure and upright; surely now he wouldawake for thee, and make the habitation of thy righteousnessprosperous. 

{8:7} Though thy beginning was small, yet thy latter endshould greatly increase. 

{8:8} For enquire, I pray thee, of the formerage, and prepare thyself to the search of their fathers: 

{8:9} (For we[are but of] yesterday, and know nothing, because our days upon earth[are] a shadow:) 

{8:10} Shall not they teach thee, [and] tell thee, andutter words out of their heart? 

{8:11} Can the rush grow up withoutmire? can the flag grow without water? 

{8:12} Whilst it [is] yet in hisgreenness, [and] not cut down, it withereth before any [other] herb.

{8:13} So [are] the paths of all that forget God; and the hypocrite'shope shall perish: 

{8:14} Whose hope shall be cut off, and whose trust[shall be] a spider's web. 

{8:15} He shall lean upon his house, but itshall not stand: he shall hold it fast, but it shall not endure. 

{8:16}He [is] green before the sun, and his branch shooteth forth in hisgarden. 

{8:17} His roots are wrapped about the heap, [and] seeth theplace of stones. 

{8:18} If he destroy him from his place, then [it]shall deny him, [saying,] I have not seen thee. 

{8:19} Behold, this[is] the joy of his way, and out of the earth shall others grow. 

{8:20}Behold, God will not cast away a perfect [man,] neither will he helpthe evil doers: 

{8:21} Till he fill thy mouth with laughing, and thylips with rejoicing. 

{8:22} They that hate thee shall be clothed withshame; and the dwelling place of the wicked shall come to nought.   

{9:1} Then Job answered and said, 

{9:2} I know [it is] so of atruth: but how should man be just with God? 

{9:3} If he will contendwith him, he cannot answer him one of a thousand. 

{9:4} [He is] wise inheart, and mighty in strength: who hath hardened [himself] against him,and hath prospered? 

{9:5} Which removeth the mountains, and they knownot: which overturneth them in his anger. 

{9:6} Which shaketh the earthout of her place, and the pillars thereof tremble. 

{9:7} Whichcommandeth the sun, and it riseth not; and sealeth up the stars. 

{9:8}Which alone spreadeth out the heavens, and treadeth upon the waves ofthe sea. 

{9:9} Which maketh Arcturus, Orion, and Pleiades, and thechambers of the south. 

{9:10} Which doeth great things past findingout; yea, and wonders without number. 

{9:11} Lo, he goeth by me, and Isee [him] not: he passeth on also, but I perceive him not. 

{9:12}Behold, he taketh away, who can hinder him? who will say unto him, Whatdoest thou? 

{9:13} [If] God will not withdraw his anger, the proudhelpers do stoop under him. 

{9:14} How much less shall I answer him,[and] choose out my words [to reason] with him? 

{9:15} Whom, though Iwere righteous, [yet] would I not answer, [but] I would makesupplication to my judge. 

{9:16} If I had called, and he had answeredme; [yet] would I not believe that he had hearkened unto my voice.

{9:17} For he breaketh me with a tempest, and multiplieth my woundswithout cause. 

{9:18} He will not suffer me to take my breath, butfilleth me with bitterness. 

{9:19} If [I speak] of strength, lo, [heis] strong: and if of judgment, who shall set me a time [to plead?]

{9:20} If I justify myself, mine own mouth shall condemn me: [if Isay, I am] perfect, it shall also prove me perverse. 

{9:21} [Though] I[were] perfect, [yet] would I not know my soul: I would despise mylife. 

{9:22} This [is] one [thing,] therefore I said [it,] Hedestroyeth the perfect and the wicked. 

{9:23} If the scourge slaysuddenly, he will laugh at the trial of the innocent. 

{9:24} The earthis given into the hand of the wicked: he covereth the faces of thejudges thereof; if not, where, [and] who [is] he? 

{9:25} Now my daysare swifter than a post: they flee away, they see no good. 

{9:26} Theyare passed away as the swift ships: as the eagle [that] hasteth to theprey. 

{9:27} If I say, I will forget my complaint, I will leave off myheaviness, and comfort [myself: ]

{9:28} I am afraid of all my sorrows,I know that thou wilt not hold me innocent. 

{9:29} [If] I be wicked,why then labour I in vain? 

{9:30} If I wash myself with snow water, andmake my hands never so clean; 

{9:31} Yet shalt thou plunge me in theditch, and mine own clothes shall abhor me. 

{9:32} For [he is] not aman, as I [am, that] I should answer him, [and] we should come togetherin judgment. 

{9:33} Neither is there any daysman betwixt us, [that]might lay his hand upon us both. 

{9:34} Let him take his rod away fromme, and let not his fear terrify me: 

{9:35} [Then] would I speak, andnot fear him; but [it is] not so with me.   

{10:1} My soul is weary of my life; I will leave my complaint uponmyself; I will speak in the bitterness of my soul. 

{10:2} I will sayunto God, Do not condemn me; shew me wherefore thou contendest with me.

{10:3} [Is it] good unto thee that thou shouldest oppress, that thoushouldest despise the work of thine hands, and shine upon the counselof the wicked? 

{10:4} Hast thou eyes of flesh? or seest thou as manseeth? 

{10:5} [Are] thy days as the days of man? [are] thy years asman's days, 

{10:6} That thou enquirest after mine iniquity, andsearchest after my sin? 

{10:7} Thou knowest that I am not wicked; and[there is] none that can deliver out of thine hand. 

{10:8} Thine handshave made me and fashioned me together round about; yet thou dostdestroy me. 

{10:9} Remember, I beseech thee, that thou hast made me asthe clay; and wilt thou bring me into dust again? 

{10:10} Hast thou notpoured me out as milk, and curdled me like cheese? 

{10:11} Thou hastclothed me with skin and flesh, and hast fenced me with bones andsinews. 

{10:12} Thou hast granted me life and favour, and thyvisitation hath preserved my spirit. 

{10:13} And these [things] hastthou hid in thine heart: I know that this [is] with thee. 

{10:14} If Isin, then thou markest me, and thou wilt not acquit me from mineiniquity. 

{10:15} If I be wicked, woe unto me; and [if] I be righteous,[yet] will I not lift up my head. [I am] full of confusion; thereforesee thou mine affliction; 

{10:16} For it increaseth. Thou huntest me asa fierce lion: and again thou shewest thyself marvellous upon me.

{10:17} Thou renewest thy witnesses against me, and increasest thineindignation upon me; changes and war [are] against me. 

{10:18}Wherefore then hast thou brought me forth out of the womb? Oh that Ihad given up the ghost, and no eye had seen me! 

{10:19} I should havebeen as though I had not been; I should have been carried from the wombto the grave. 

{10:20} [Are] not my days few? cease [then, and] let mealone, that I may take comfort a little, 

{10:21} Before I go [whence] Ishall not return, [even] to the land of darkness and the shadow ofdeath; 

{10:22} A land of darkness, as darkness [itself; and] of theshadow of death, without any order, and [where] the light [is] asdarkness.   

{11:1} Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said, 

{11:2} Shouldnot the multitude of words be answered? and should a man full of talkbe justified? 

{11:3} Should thy lies make men hold their peace? andwhen thou mockest, shall no man make thee ashamed? 

{11:4} For thou hastsaid, My doctrine [is] pure, and I am clean in thine eyes. 

{11:5} Butoh that God would speak, and open his lips against thee; 

{11:6} Andthat he would shew thee the secrets of wisdom, that [they are] doubleto that which is! Know therefore that God exacteth of thee [less] thanthine iniquity [deserveth. ]

{11:7} Canst thou by searching find outGod? canst thou find out the Almighty unto perfection? 

{11:8} [It is]as high as heaven; what canst thou do? deeper than hell; what canstthou know? 

{11:9} The measure thereof [is] longer than the earth, andbroader than the sea. 

{11:10} If he cut off, and shut up, or gathertogether, then who can hinder him? 

{11:11} For he knoweth vain men: heseeth wickedness also; will he not then consider [it? ]

{11:12} For vainman would be wise, though man be born [like] a wild ass's colt. 

{11:13}If thou prepare thine heart, and stretch out thine hands toward him;

{11:14} If iniquity [be] in thine hand, put it far away, and let notwickedness dwell in thy tabernacles. 

{11:15} For then shalt thou liftup thy face without spot; yea, thou shalt be stedfast, and shalt notfear: 

{11:16} Because thou shalt forget [thy] misery, [and] remember[it] as waters [that] pass away: 

{11:17} And [thine] age shall beclearer than the noonday; thou shalt shine forth, thou shalt be as themorning. 

{11:18} And thou shalt be secure, because there is hope; yea,thou shalt dig [about thee, and] thou shalt take thy rest in safety.

{11:19} Also thou shalt lie down, and none shall make [thee] afraid;yea, many shall make suit unto thee. 

{11:20} But the eyes of the wickedshall fail, and they shall not escape, and their hope [shall be as] thegiving up of the ghost.   

{12:1} And Job answered and said, 

{12:2} No doubt but ye [are] thepeople, and wisdom shall die with you. 

{12:3} But I have understandingas well as you; I [am] not inferior to you: yea, who knoweth not suchthings as these? 

{12:4} I am [as] one mocked of his neighbour, whocalleth upon God, and he answereth him: the just upright [man is]laughed to scorn. 

{12:5} He that is ready to slip with [his] feet [isas] a lamp despised in the thought of him that is at ease. 

{12:6} Thetabernacles of robbers prosper, and they that provoke God are secure;into whose hand God bringeth [abundantly. ]

{12:7} But ask now thebeasts, and they shall teach thee; and the fowls of the air, and theyshall tell thee: 

{12:8} Or speak to the earth, and it shall teach thee:and the fishes of the sea shall declare unto thee. 

{12:9} Who knowethnot in all these that the hand of the LORD hath wrought this? 

{12:10}In whose hand [is] the soul of every living thing, and the breath ofall mankind. 

{12:11} Doth not the ear try words? and the mouth tastehis meat? 

{12:12} With the ancient [is] wisdom; and in length of daysunderstanding. 

{12:13} With him [is] wisdom and strength, he hathcounsel and understanding. 

{12:14} Behold, he breaketh down, and itcannot be built again: he shutteth up a man, and there can be noopening. 

{12:15} Behold, he withholdeth the waters, and they dry up:also he sendeth them out, and they overturn the earth. 

{12:16} With him[is] strength and wisdom: the deceived and the deceiver [are] his.

{12:17} He leadeth counsellors away spoiled, and maketh the judgesfools. 

{12:18} He looseth the bond of kings, and girdeth their loinswith a girdle. 

{12:19} He leadeth princes away spoiled, andoverthroweth the mighty. 

{12:20} He removeth away the speech of thetrusty, and taketh away the understanding of the aged. 

{12:21} Hepoureth contempt upon princes, and weakeneth the strength of themighty. 

{12:22} He discovereth deep things out of darkness, andbringeth out to light the shadow of death. 

{12:23} He increaseth thenations, and destroyeth them: he enlargeth the nations, and straiteneththem [again. ]

{12:24} He taketh away the heart of the chief of thepeople of the earth, and causeth them to wander in a wilderness [wherethere is] no way. 

{12:25} They grope in the dark without light, and hemaketh them to stagger like [a] drunken [man.]   

{13:1} Lo, mine eye hath seen all [this,] mine ear hath heard andunderstood it. 

{13:2} What ye know, [the same] do I know also: I [am]not inferior unto you. 

{13:3} Surely I would speak to the Almighty, andI desire to reason with God. 

{13:4} But ye [are] forgers of lies, ye[are] all physicians of no value. 

{13:5} Oh that ye would altogetherhold your peace! and it should be your wisdom. 

{13:6} Hear now myreasoning, and hearken to the pleadings of my lips. 

{13:7} Will yespeak wickedly for God? and talk deceitfully for him? 

{13:8} Will yeaccept his person? will ye contend for God? 

{13:9} Is it good that heshould search you out? or as one man mocketh another, do ye [so] mockhim? 

{13:10} He will surely reprove you, if ye do secretly acceptpersons. 

{13:11} Shall not his excellency make you afraid? and hisdread fall upon you? 

{13:12} Your remembrances [are] like unto ashes,your bodies to bodies of clay. 

{13:13} Hold your peace, let me alone,that I may speak, and let come on me what [will. ]

{13:14} Wherefore doI take my flesh in my teeth, and put my life in mine hand? 

{13:15}Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him: but I will maintain mineown ways before him. 

{13:16} He also [shall be] my salvation: for anhypocrite shall not come before him. 

{13:17} Hear diligently my speech,and my declaration with your ears. 

{13:18} Behold now, I have ordered[my] cause; I know that I shall be justified. 

{13:19} Who [is] he[that] will plead with me? for now, if I hold my tongue, I shall giveup the ghost. 

{13:20} Only do not two [things] unto me: then will I nothide myself from thee. 

{13:21} Withdraw thine hand far from me: and letnot thy dread make me afraid. 

{13:22} Then call thou, and I willanswer: or let me speak, and answer thou me. 

{13:23} How many [are]mine iniquities and sins? make me to know my transgression and my sin.

{13:24} Wherefore hidest thou thy face, and holdest me for thine enemy?

{13:25} Wilt thou break a leaf driven to and fro? and wilt thou pursuethe dry stubble? 

{13:26} For thou writest bitter things against me, andmakest me to possess the iniquities of my youth. 

{13:27} Thou puttestmy feet also in the stocks, and lookest narrowly unto all my paths;thou settest a print upon the heels of my feet. 

{13:28} And he, as arotten thing, consumeth, as a garment that is moth eaten.   

{14:1} Man [that is] born of a woman [is] of few days, and full oftrouble. 

{14:2} He cometh forth like a flower, and is cut down: hefleeth also as a shadow, and continueth not. 

{14:3} And dost thou openthine eyes upon such an one, and bringest me into judgment with thee?

{14:4} Who can bring a clean [thing] out of an unclean? not one. 

{14:5}Seeing his days [are] determined, the number of his months [are] withthee, thou hast appointed his bounds that he cannot pass; 

{14:6} Turnfrom him, that he may rest, till he shall accomplish, as an hireling,his day. 

{14:7} For there is hope of a tree, if it be cut down, that itwill sprout again, and that the tender branch thereof will not cease.

{14:8} Though the root thereof wax old in the earth, and the stockthereof die in the ground; 

{14:9} [Yet] through the scent of water itwill bud, and bring forth boughs like a plant. 

{14:10} But man dieth,and wasteth away: yea, man giveth up the ghost, and where [is] he?

{14:11} [As] the waters fail from the sea, and the flood decayeth anddrieth up: 

{14:12} So man lieth down, and riseth not: till the heavens[be] no more, they shall not awake, nor be raised out of their sleep.

{14:13} Oh that thou wouldest hide me in the grave, that thou wouldestkeep me secret, until thy wrath be past, that thou wouldest appoint mea set time, and remember me! 

{14:14} If a man die, shall he live[again?] all the days of my appointed time will I wait, till my changecome. 

{14:15} Thou shalt call, and I will answer thee: thou wilt have adesire to the work of thine hands. 

{14:16} For now thou numberest mysteps: dost thou not watch over my sin? 

{14:17} My transgression [is]sealed up in a bag, and thou sewest up mine iniquity. 

{14:18} Andsurely the mountain falling cometh to nought, and the rock is removedout of his place. 

{14:19} The waters wear the stones: thou washest awaythe things which grow [out] of the dust of the earth; and thoudestroyest the hope of man. 

{14:20} Thou prevailest for ever againsthim, and he passeth: thou changest his countenance, and sendest himaway. 

{14:21} His sons come to honour, and he knoweth [it] not; andthey are brought low, but he perceiveth [it] not of them. 

{14:22} Buthis flesh upon him shall have pain, and his soul within him shall mourn.   

{15:1} Then answered Eliphaz the Temanite, and said, 

{15:2} Should awise man utter vain knowledge, and fill his belly with the east wind?

{15:3} Should he reason with unprofitable talk? or with speecheswherewith he can do no good? 

{15:4} Yea, thou castest off fear, andrestrainest prayer before God. 

{15:5} For thy mouth uttereth thineiniquity, and thou choosest the tongue of the crafty. 

{15:6} Thine ownmouth condemneth thee, and not I: yea, thine own lips testify againstthee. 

{15:7} [Art] thou the first man [that] was born? or wast thoumade before the hills? 

{15:8} Hast thou heard the secret of God? anddost thou restrain wisdom to thyself? 

{15:9} What knowest thou, that weknow not? [what] understandest thou, which [is] not in us? 

{15:10} Withus [are] both the grayheaded and very aged men, much elder than thyfather. 

{15:11} [Are] the consolations of God small with thee? is thereany secret thing with thee? 

{15:12} Why doth thine heart carry theeaway? and what do thy eyes wink at, 

{15:13} That thou turnest thyspirit against God, and lettest [such] words go out of thy mouth?

{15:14} What [is] man, that he should be clean? and [he which is] bornof a woman, that he should be righteous? 

{15:15} Behold, he putteth notrust in his saints; yea, the heavens are not clean in his sight.

{15:16} How much more abominable and filthy [is] man, which drinkethiniquity like water? 

{15:17} I will shew thee, hear me; and that[which] I have seen I will declare; 

{15:18} Which wise men have toldfrom their fathers, and have not hid [it: ]

{15:19} Unto whom alone theearth was given, and no stranger passed among them. 

{15:20} The wickedman travaileth with pain all [his] days, and the number of years ishidden to the oppressor. 

{15:21} A dreadful sound [is] in his ears: inprosperity the destroyer shall come upon him. 

{15:22} He believeth notthat he shall return out of darkness, and he is waited for of thesword. 

{15:23} He wandereth abroad for bread, [saying,] Where [is it?]he knoweth that the day of darkness is ready at his hand. 

{15:24}Trouble and anguish shall make him afraid; they shall prevail againsthim, as a king ready to the battle. 

{15:25} For he stretcheth out hishand against God, and strengtheneth himself against the Almighty.

{15:26} He runneth upon him, [even] on [his] neck, upon the thickbosses of his bucklers: 

{15:27} Because he covereth his face with hisfatness, and maketh collops of fat on [his] flanks. 

{15:28} And hedwelleth in desolate cities, [and] in houses which no man inhabiteth,which are ready to become heaps. 

{15:29} He shall not be rich, neithershall his substance continue, neither shall he prolong the perfectionthereof upon the earth. 

{15:30} He shall not depart out of darkness;the flame shall dry up his branches, and by the breath of his mouthshall he go away. 

{15:31} Let not him that is deceived trust in vanity:for vanity shall be his recompence. 

{15:32} It shall be accomplishedbefore his time, and his branch shall not be green. 

{15:33} He shallshake off his unripe grape as the vine, and shall cast off his floweras the olive. 

{15:34} For the congregation of hypocrites [shall be]desolate, and fire shall consume the tabernacles of bribery. 

{15:35}They conceive mischief, and bring forth vanity, and their bellyprepareth deceit.   

{16:1} Then Job answered and said, 

{16:2} I have heard many suchthings: miserable comforters [are] ye all. 

{16:3} Shall vain words havean end? or what emboldeneth thee that thou answerest? 

{16:4} I alsocould speak as ye [do:] if your soul were in my soul's stead, I couldheap up words against you, and shake mine head at you. 

{16:5} [But] Iwould strengthen you with my mouth, and the moving of my lips shouldasswage [your grief. ]

{16:6} Though I speak, my grief is not asswaged:and [though] I forbear, what am I eased? 

{16:7} But now he hath made meweary: thou hast made desolate all my company. 

{16:8} And thou hastfilled me with wrinkles, [which] is a witness [against me:] and myleanness rising up in me beareth witness to my face. 

{16:9} He teareth[me] in his wrath, who hateth me: he gnasheth upon me with his teeth;mine enemy sharpeneth his eyes upon me. 

{16:10} They have gaped upon mewith their mouth; they have smitten me upon the cheek reproachfully;they have gathered themselves together against me. 

{16:11} God hathdelivered me to the ungodly, and turned me over into the hands of thewicked. 

{16:12} I was at ease, but he hath broken me asunder: he hathalso taken [me] by my neck, and shaken me to pieces, and set me up forhis mark. 

{16:13} His archers compass me round about, he cleaveth myreins asunder, and doth not spare; he poureth out my gall upon theground. 

{16:14} He breaketh me with breach upon breach, he runneth uponme like a giant. 

{16:15} I have sewed sackcloth upon my skin, anddefiled my horn in the dust. 

{16:16} My face is foul with weeping, andmy eyelids is the shadow of death; 

{16:17} Not for [any] injustice inmine hands: also my prayer [is] pure. 

{16:18} O earth, cover not thoumy blood, and let my cry have no place. 

{16:19} Also now, behold, mywitness [is] in heaven, and my record [is] on high. 

{16:20} My friendsscorn me: [but] mine eye poureth out [tears] unto God. 

{16:21} Oh thatone might plead for a man with God, as a man [pleadeth] for hisneighbour! 

{16:22} When a few years are come, then I shall go the way[whence] I shall not return.   

{17:1} My breath is corrupt, my days are extinct, the graves [areready] for me. 

{17:2} [Are there] not mockers with me? and doth notmine eye continue in their provocation? 

{17:3} Lay down now, put me ina surety with thee; who [is] he [that] will strike hands with me?

{17:4} For thou hast hid their heart from understanding: thereforeshalt thou not exalt [them. ]

{17:5} He that speaketh flattery to [his]friends, even the eyes of his children shall fail. 

{17:6} He hath mademe also a byword of the people; and aforetime I was as a tabret. 

{17:7}Mine eye also is dim by reason of sorrow, and all my members [are] as ashadow. 

{17:8} Upright [men] shall be astonied at this, and theinnocent shall stir up himself against the hypocrite. 

{17:9} Therighteous also shall hold on his way, and he that hath clean handsshall be stronger and stronger. 

{17:10} But as for you all, do yereturn, and come now: for I cannot find [one] wise [man] among you.

{17:11} My days are past, my purposes are broken off, [even] thethoughts of my heart. 

{17:12} They change the night into day: the light[is] short because of darkness. 

{17:13} If I wait, the grave [is] minehouse: I have made my bed in the darkness. 

{17:14} I have said tocorruption, Thou [art] my father: to the worm, [Thou art] my mother,and my sister. 

{17:15} And where [is] now my hope? as for my hope, whoshall see it? 

{17:16} They shall go down to the bars of the pit, when[our] rest together [is] in the dust.   

{18:1} Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said, 

{18:2} How long[will it be ere] ye make an end of words? mark, and afterwards we willspeak. 

{18:3} Wherefore are we counted as beasts, [and] reputed vile inyour sight? 

{18:4} He teareth himself in his anger: shall the earth beforsaken for thee? and shall the rock be removed out of his place?

{18:5} Yea, the light of the wicked shall be put out, and the spark ofhis fire shall not shine. 

{18:6} The light shall be dark in histabernacle, and his candle shall be put out with him. 

{18:7} The stepsof his strength shall be straitened, and his own counsel shall cast himdown. 

{18:8} For he is cast into a net by his own feet, and he walkethupon a snare. 

{18:9} The gin shall take [him] by the heel, [and] therobber shall prevail against him. 

{18:10} The snare [is] laid for himin the ground, and a trap for him in the way. 

{18:11} Terrors shallmake him afraid on every side, and shall drive him to his feet. 

{18:12}His strength shall be hungerbitten, and destruction [shall be] ready athis side. 

{18:13} It shall devour the strength of his skin: [even] thefirstborn of death shall devour his strength. 

{18:14} His confidenceshall be rooted out of his tabernacle, and it shall bring him to theking of terrors. 

{18:15} It shall dwell in his tabernacle, because [itis] none of his: brimstone shall be scattered upon his habitation.

{18:16} His roots shall be dried up beneath, and above shall his branchbe cut off. 

{18:17} His remembrance shall perish from the earth, and heshall have no name in the street. 

{18:18} He shall be driven from lightinto darkness, and chased out of the world. 

{18:19} He shall neitherhave son nor nephew among his people, nor any remaining in hisdwellings. 

{18:20} They that come after [him] shall be astonied at hisday, as they that went before were affrighted. 

{18:21} Surely such[are] the dwellings of the wicked, and this [is] the place [of himthat] knoweth not God.   

{19:1} Then Job answered and said, 

{19:2} How long will ye vex mysoul, and break me in pieces with words? 

{19:3} These ten times have yereproached me: ye are not ashamed [that] ye make yourselves strange tome. 

{19:4} And be it indeed [that] I have erred, mine error remainethwith myself. 

{19:5} If indeed ye will magnify [yourselves] against me,and plead against me my reproach: 

{19:6} Know now that God hathoverthrown me, and hath compassed me with his net. 

{19:7} Behold, I cryout of wrong, but I am not heard: I cry aloud, but [there is] nojudgment. 

{19:8} He hath fenced up my way that I cannot pass, and hehath set darkness in my paths. 

{19:9} He hath stripped me of my glory,and taken the crown [from] my head. 

{19:10} He hath destroyed me onevery side, and I am gone: and mine hope hath he removed like a tree.

{19:11} He hath also kindled his wrath against me, and he counteth meunto him as [one of] his enemies. 

{19:12} His troops come together, andraise up their way against me, and encamp round about my tabernacle.

{19:13} He hath put my brethren far from me, and mine acquaintance areverily estranged from me. 

{19:14} My kinsfolk have failed, and myfamiliar friends have forgotten me. 

{19:15} They that dwell in minehouse, and my maids, count me for a stranger: I am an alien in theirsight. 

{19:16} I called my servant, and he gave [me] no answer; Iintreated him with my mouth. 

{19:17} My breath is strange to my wife,though I intreated for the children's [sake] of mine own body. 

{19:18}Yea, young children despised me; I arose, and they spake against me.

{19:19} All my inward friends abhorred me: and they whom I loved areturned against me. 

{19:20} My bone cleaveth to my skin and to my flesh,and I am escaped with the skin of my teeth. 

{19:21} Have pity upon me,have pity upon me, O ye my friends; for the hand of God hath touchedme. 

{19:22} Why do ye persecute me as God, and are not satisfied withmy flesh? 

{19:23} Oh that my words were now written! oh that they wereprinted in a book! 

{19:24} That they were graven with an iron pen andlead in the rock for ever! 

{19:25} For I know [that] my redeemerliveth, and [that] he shall stand at the latter [day] upon the earth:

{19:26} And [though] after my skin [worms] destroy this [body,] yet inmy flesh shall I see God: 

{19:27} Whom I shall see for myself, and mineeyes shall behold, and not another; [though] my reins be consumedwithin me. 

{19:28} But ye should say, Why persecute we him, seeing theroot of the matter is found in me? 

{19:29} Be ye afraid of the sword:for wrath [bringeth] the punishments of the sword, that ye may know[there is] a judgment.   

{20:1} Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said, 

{20:2}Therefore do my thoughts cause me to answer, and for [this] I makehaste. 

{20:3} I have heard the check of my reproach, and the spirit ofmy understanding causeth me to answer. 

{20:4} Knowest thou [not] thisof old, since man was placed upon earth, 

{20:5} That the triumphing ofthe wicked [is] short, and the joy of the hypocrite [but] for a moment?

{20:6} Though his excellency mount up to the heavens, and his headreach unto the clouds; 

{20:7} [Yet] he shall perish for ever like hisown dung: they which have seen him shall say, Where [is] he? 

{20:8} Heshall fly away as a dream, and shall not be found: yea, he shall bechased away as a vision of the night. 

{20:9} The eye also [which] sawhim shall [see him] no more; neither shall his place any more beholdhim. 

{20:10} His children shall seek to please the poor, and his handsshall restore their goods. 

{20:11} His bones are full [of the sin] ofhis youth, which shall lie down with him in the dust. 

{20:12} Thoughwickedness be sweet in his mouth, [though] he hide it under his tongue;

{20:13} [Though] he spare it, and forsake it not; but keep it stillwithin his mouth: 

{20:14} [Yet] his meat in his bowels is turned, [itis] the gall of asps within him. 

{20:15} He hath swallowed down riches,and he shall vomit them up again: God shall cast them out of his belly.

{20:16} He shall suck the poison of asps: the viper's tongue shall slayhim. 

{20:17} He shall not see the rivers, the floods, the brooks ofhoney and butter. 

{20:18} That which he laboured for shall he restore,and shall not swallow [it] down: according to [his] substance [shall]the restitution [be,] and he shall not rejoice [therein. ]

{20:19}Because he hath oppressed [and] hath forsaken the poor; [because] hehath violently taken away an house which he builded not; 

{20:20} Surelyhe shall not feel quietness in his belly, he shall not save of thatwhich he desired. 

{20:21} There shall none of his meat be left;therefore shall no man look for his goods. 

{20:22} In the fulness ofhis sufficiency he shall be in straits: every hand of the wicked shallcome upon him. 

{20:23} [When] he is about to fill his belly, [God]shall cast the fury of his wrath upon him, and shall rain [it] upon himwhile he is eating. 

{20:24} He shall flee from the iron weapon, [and]the bow of steel shall strike him through. 

{20:25} It is drawn, andcometh out of the body; yea, the glittering sword cometh out of hisgall: terrors [are] upon him. 

{20:26} All darkness [shall be] hid inhis secret places: a fire not blown shall consume him; it shall go illwith him that is left in his tabernacle. 

{20:27} The heaven shallreveal his iniquity; and the earth shall rise up against him. 

{20:28}The increase of his house shall depart, [and his goods] shall flow awayin the day of his wrath. 

{20:29} This [is] the portion of a wicked manfrom God, and the heritage appointed unto him by God.   

{21:1} But Job answered and said, 

{21:2} Hear diligently my speech,and let this be your consolations. 

{21:3} Suffer me that I may speak;and after that I have spoken, mock on. 

{21:4} As for me, [is] mycomplaint to man? and if [it were so,] why should not my spirit betroubled? 

{21:5} Mark me, and be astonished, and lay [your] hand upon[your] mouth. 

{21:6} Even when I remember I am afraid, and tremblingtaketh hold on my flesh. 

{21:7} Wherefore do the wicked live, becomeold, yea, are mighty in power? 

{21:8} Their seed is established intheir sight with them, and their offspring before their eyes. 

{21:9}Their houses [are] safe from fear, neither [is] the rod of God uponthem. 

{21:10} Their bull gendereth, and faileth not; their cow calveth,and casteth not her calf. 

{21:11} They send forth their little oneslike a flock, and their children dance. 

{21:12} They take the timbreland harp, and rejoice at the sound of the organ. 

{21:13} They spendtheir days in wealth, and in a moment go down to the grave. 

{21:14}Therefore they say unto God, Depart from us; for we desire not theknowledge of thy ways. 

{21:15} What [is] the Almighty, that we shouldserve him? and what profit should we have, if we pray unto him? 

{21:16}Lo, their good [is] not in their hand: the counsel of the wicked is farfrom me. 

{21:17} How oft is the candle of the wicked put out! and [howoft] cometh their destruction upon them! [God] distributeth sorrows inhis anger. 

{21:18} They are as stubble before the wind, and as chaffthat the storm carrieth away. 

{21:19} God layeth up his iniquity forhis children: he rewardeth him, and he shall know [it. ]

{21:20} Hiseyes shall see his destruction, and he shall drink of the wrath of theAlmighty. 

{21:21} For what pleasure [hath] he in his house after him,when the number of his months is cut off in the midst? 

{21:22} Shall[any] teach God knowledge? seeing he judgeth those that are high.

{21:23} One dieth in his full strength, being wholly at ease and quiet.

{21:24} His breasts are full of milk, and his bones are moistened withmarrow. 

{21:25} And another dieth in the bitterness of his soul, andnever eateth with pleasure. 

{21:26} They shall lie down alike in thedust, and the worms shall cover them. 

{21:27} Behold, I know yourthoughts, and the devices [which] ye wrongfully imagine against me.

{21:28} For ye say, Where [is] the house of the prince? and where [are]the dwelling places of the wicked? 

{21:29} Have ye not asked them thatgo by the way? and do ye not know their tokens, 

{21:30} That the wickedis reserved to the day of destruction? they shall be brought forth tothe day of wrath. 

{21:31} Who shall declare his way to his face? andwho shall repay him [what] he hath done? 

{21:32} Yet shall he bebrought to the grave, and shall remain in the tomb. 

{21:33} The clodsof the valley shall be sweet unto him, and every man shall draw afterhim, as [there are] innumerable before him. 

{21:34} How then comfort yeme in vain, seeing in your answers there remaineth falsehood?   

{22:1} Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said, 

{22:2} Can a manbe profitable unto God, as he that is wise may be profitable untohimself? 

{22:3} [Is it] any pleasure to the Almighty, that thou artrighteous? or [is it] gain [to him] that thou makest thy ways perfect?

{22:4} Will he reprove thee for fear of thee? will he enter with theeinto judgment? 

{22:5} [Is] not thy wickedness great? and thineiniquities infinite? 

{22:6} For thou hast taken a pledge from thybrother for nought, and stripped the naked of their clothing. 

{22:7}Thou hast not given water to the weary to drink, and thou hastwithholden bread from the hungry. 

{22:8} But [as for] the mighty man,he had the earth; and the honourable man dwelt in it. 

{22:9} Thou hastsent widows away empty, and the arms of the fatherless have beenbroken. 

{22:10} Therefore snares [are] round about thee, and suddenfear troubleth thee; 

{22:11} Or darkness, [that] thou canst not see;and abundance of waters cover thee. 

{22:12} [Is] not God in the heightof heaven? and behold the height of the stars, how high they are!

{22:13} And thou sayest, How doth God know? can he judge through thedark cloud? 

{22:14} Thick clouds [are] a covering to him, that he seethnot; and he walketh in the circuit of heaven. 

{22:15} Hast thou markedthe old way which wicked men have trodden? 

{22:16} Which were cut downout of time, whose foundation was overflown with a flood: 

{22:17} Whichsaid unto God, Depart from us: and what can the Almighty do for them?

{22:18} Yet he filled their houses with good [things:] but the counselof the wicked is far from me. 

{22:19} The righteous see [it,] and areglad: and the innocent laugh them to scorn. 

{22:20} Whereas oursubstance is not cut down, but the remnant of them the fire consumeth.

{22:21} Acquaint now thyself with him, and be at peace: thereby goodshall come unto thee. 

{22:22} Receive, I pray thee, the law from hismouth, and lay up his words in thine heart. 

{22:23} If thou return tothe Almighty, thou shalt be built up, thou shalt put away iniquity farfrom thy tabernacles. 

{22:24} Then shalt thou lay up gold as dust, andthe [gold] of Ophir as the stones of the brooks. 

{22:25} Yea, theAlmighty shall be thy defence, and thou shalt have plenty of silver.

{22:26} For then shalt thou have thy delight in the Almighty, and shaltlift up thy face unto God. 

{22:27} Thou shalt make thy prayer unto him,and he shall hear thee, and thou shalt pay thy vows. 

{22:28} Thou shaltalso decree a thing, and it shall be established unto thee: and thelight shall shine upon thy ways. 

{22:29} When [men] are cast down, thenthou shalt say, [There is] lifting up; and he shall save the humbleperson. 

{22:30} He shall deliver the island of the innocent: and it isdelivered by the pureness of thine hands.   

{23:1} Then Job answered and said, 

{23:2} Even to day [is] mycomplaint bitter: my stroke is heavier than my groaning. 

{23:3} Oh thatI knew where I might find him! [that] I might come [even] to his seat!

{23:4} I would order [my] cause before him, and fill my mouth witharguments. 

{23:5} I would know the words [which] he would answer me,and understand what he would say unto me. 

{23:6} Will he plead againstme with [his] great power? No; but he would put [strength] in me.

{23:7} There the righteous might dispute with him; so should I bedelivered for ever from my judge. 

{23:8} Behold, I go forward, but he[is] not [there;] and backward, but I cannot perceive him: 

{23:9} Onthe left hand, where he doth work, but I cannot behold [him:] he hidethhimself on the right hand, that I cannot see [him: ]

{23:10} But heknoweth the way that I take: [when] he hath tried me, I shall comeforth as gold. 

{23:11} My foot hath held his steps, his way have Ikept, and not declined. 

{23:12} Neither have I gone back from thecommandment of his lips; I have esteemed the words of his mouth morethan my necessary [food. ]

{23:13} But he [is] in one [mind,] and whocan turn him? and [what] his soul desireth, even [that] he doeth.

{23:14} For he performeth [the thing that is] appointed for me: andmany such [things are] with him. 

{23:15} Therefore am I troubled at hispresence: when I consider, I am afraid of him. 

{23:16} For God makethmy heart soft, and the Almighty troubleth me: 

{23:17} Because I was notcut off before the darkness, [neither] hath he covered the darknessfrom my face.   

{24:1} Why, seeing times are not hidden from the Almighty, do theythat know him not see his days? 

{24:2} [Some] remove the landmarks;they violently take away flocks, and feed [thereof. ]

{24:3} They driveaway the ass of the fatherless, they take the widow's ox for a pledge.

{24:4} They turn the needy out of the way: the poor of the earth hidethemselves together. 

{24:5} Behold, [as] wild asses in the desert, gothey forth to their work; rising betimes for a prey: the wilderness[yieldeth] food for them [and] for [their] children. 

{24:6} They reap[every one] his corn in the field: and they gather the vintage of thewicked. 

{24:7} They cause the naked to lodge without clothing, that[they have] no covering in the cold. 

{24:8} They are wet with theshowers of the mountains, and embrace the rock for want of a shelter.

{24:9} They pluck the fatherless from the breast, and take a pledge ofthe poor. 

{24:10} They cause [him] to go naked without clothing, andthey take away the sheaf [from] the hungry; 

{24:11} [Which] make oilwithin their walls, [and] tread [their] winepresses, and suffer thirst.

{24:12} Men groan from out of the city, and the soul of the woundedcrieth out: yet God layeth not folly [to them. ]

{24:13} They are ofthose that rebel against the light; they know not the ways thereof, norabide in the paths thereof. 

{24:14} The murderer rising with the lightkilleth the poor and needy, and in the night is as a thief. 

{24:15} Theeye also of the adulterer waiteth for the twilight, saying, No eyeshall see me: and disguiseth [his] face. 

{24:16} In the dark they digthrough houses, [which] they had marked for themselves in the daytime:they know not the light. 

{24:17} For the morning [is] to them even asthe shadow of death: if [one] know [them, they are in] the terrors ofthe shadow of death. 

{24:18} He [is] swift as the waters; their portionis cursed in the earth: he beholdeth not the way of the vineyards.

{24:19} Drought and heat consume the snow waters: [so doth] the grave[those which] have sinned. 

{24:20} The womb shall forget him; the wormshall feed sweetly on him; he shall be no more remembered; andwickedness shall be broken as a tree. 

{24:21} He evil entreateth thebarren that [beareth] not: and doeth not good to the widow. 

{24:22} Hedraweth also the mighty with his power: he riseth up, and no [man] issure of life. 

{24:23} [Though] it be given him [to be] in safety,whereon he resteth; yet his eyes [are] upon their ways. 

{24:24} Theyare exalted for a little while, but are gone and brought low; they aretaken out of the way as all [other,] and cut off as the tops of theears of corn. 

{24:25} And if [it be] not [so] now, who will make me aliar, and make my speech nothing worth?   

{25:1} Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said, 

{25:2} Dominionand fear [are] with him, he maketh peace in his high places. 

{25:3} Isthere any number of his armies? and upon whom doth not his light arise?

{25:4} How then can man be justified with God? or how can he be clean[that is] born of a woman? 

{25:5} Behold even to the moon, and itshineth not; yea, the stars are not pure in his sight. 

{25:6} How muchless man, [that is] a worm? and the son of man, [which is] a worm?   

{26:1} But Job answered and said, 

{26:2} How hast thou helped [himthat is] without power? [how] savest thou the arm [that hath] nostrength? 

{26:3} How hast thou counseled [him that hath] no wisdom? and[how] hast thou plentifully declared the thing as it is? 

{26:4} To whomhast thou uttered words? and whose spirit came from thee? 

{26:5} Dead[things] are formed from under the waters, and the inhabitants thereof.

{26:6} Hell [is] naked before him, and destruction hath no covering.

{26:7} He stretcheth out the north over the empty place, [and] hangeththe earth upon nothing. 

{26:8} He bindeth up the waters in his thickclouds; and the cloud is not rent under them. 

{26:9} He holdeth backthe face of his throne, [and] spreadeth his cloud upon it. 

{26:10} Hehath compassed the waters with bounds, until the day and night come toan end. 

{26:11} The pillars of heaven tremble and are astonished at hisreproof. 

{26:12} He divideth the sea with his power, and by hisunderstanding he smiteth through the proud. 

{26:13} By his spirit hehath garnished the heavens; his hand hath formed the crooked serpent.

{26:14} Lo, these [are] parts of his ways: but how little a portion isheard of him? but the thunder of his power who can understand?   

{27:1} Moreover Job continued his parable, and said, 

{27:2} [As] Godliveth, [who] hath taken away my judgment; and the Almighty, [who] hathvexed my soul; 

{27:3} All the while my breath [is] in me, and thespirit of God [is] in my nostrils; 

{27:4} My lips shall not speakwickedness, nor my tongue utter deceit. 

{27:5} God forbid that I shouldjustify you: till I die I will not remove mine integrity from me.

{27:6} My righteousness I hold fast, and will not let it go: my heartshall not reproach [me] so long as I live. 

{27:7} Let mine enemy be asthe wicked, and he that riseth up against me as the unrighteous. 

{27:8}For what [is] the hope of the hypocrite, though he hath gained, whenGod taketh away his soul? 

{27:9} Will God hear his cry when troublecometh upon him? 

{27:10} Will he delight himself in the Almighty? willhe always call upon God? 

{27:11} I will teach you by the hand of God:[that] which [is] with the Almighty will I not conceal. 

{27:12} Behold,all ye yourselves have seen [it;] why then are ye thus altogether vain?

{27:13} This [is] the portion of a wicked man with God, and theheritage of oppressors, [which] they shall receive of the Almighty.

{27:14} If his children be multiplied, [it is] for the sword: and hisoffspring shall not be satisfied with bread. 

{27:15} Those that remainof him shall be buried in death: and his widows shall not weep. 

{27:16}Though he heap up silver as the dust, and prepare raiment as the clay;

{27:17} He may prepare [it,] but the just shall put [it] on, and theinnocent shall divide the silver. 

{27:18} He buildeth his house as amoth, and as a booth [that] the keeper maketh. 

{27:19} The rich manshall lie down, but he shall not be gathered: he openeth his eyes, andhe [is] not. 

{27:20} Terrors take hold on him as waters, a tempeststealeth him away in the night. 

{27:21} The east wind carrieth himaway, and he departeth: and as a storm hurleth him out of his place.

{27:22} For [God] shall cast upon him, and not spare: he would fainflee out of his hand. 

{27:23} [Men] shall clap their hands at him, andshall hiss him out of his place.   

{28:1} Surely there is a vein for the silver, and a place for gold[where] they fine [it. ]

{28:2} Iron is taken out of the earth, andbrass [is] molten [out of] the stone. 

{28:3} He setteth an end todarkness, and searcheth out all perfection: the stones of darkness, andthe shadow of death. 

{28:4} The flood breaketh out from the inhabitant;[even the waters] forgotten of the foot: they are dried up, they aregone away from men. 

{28:5} [As for] the earth, out of it cometh bread:and under it is turned up as it were fire. 

{28:6} The stones of it[are] the place of sapphires: and it hath dust of gold. 

{28:7} [Thereis] a path which no fowl knoweth, and which the vulture's eye hath notseen: 

{28:8} The lion's whelps have not trodden it, nor the fierce lionpassed by it. 

{28:9} He putteth forth his hand upon the rock; heoverturneth the mountains by the roots. 

{28:10} He cutteth out riversamong the rocks; and his eye seeth every precious thing. 

{28:11} Hebindeth the floods from overflowing; and [the thing that is] hidbringeth he forth to light. 

{28:12} But where shall wisdom be found?and where [is] the place of understanding? 

{28:13} Man knoweth not theprice thereof; neither is it found in the land of the living. 

{28:14}The depth saith, It [is] not in me: and the sea saith, [It is] not withme. 

{28:15} It cannot be gotten for gold, neither shall silver beweighed [for] the price thereof. 

{28:16} It cannot be valued with thegold of Ophir, with the precious onyx, or the sapphire. 

{28:17} Thegold and the crystal cannot equal it: and the exchange of it [shall notbe for] jewels of fine gold. 

{28:18} No mention shall be made of coral,or of pearls: for the price of wisdom [is] above rubies. 

{28:19} Thetopaz of Ethiopia shall not equal it, neither shall it be valued withpure gold. 

{28:20} Whence then cometh wisdom? and where [is] the placeof understanding? 

{28:21} Seeing it is hid from the eyes of all living,and kept close from the fowls of the air. 

{28:22} Destruction and deathsay, We have heard the fame thereof with our ears. 

{28:23} Godunderstandeth the way thereof, and he knoweth the place thereof.

{28:24} For he looketh to the ends of the earth, [and] seeth under thewhole heaven; 

{28:25} To make the weight for the winds; and he weigheththe waters by measure. 

{28:26} When he made a decree for the rain, anda way for the lightning of the thunder: 

{28:27} Then did he see it, anddeclare it; he prepared it, yea, and searched it out. 

{28:28} And untoman he said, Behold, the fear of the Lord, that [is] wisdom; and todepart from evil [is] understanding.   

{29:1} Moreover Job continued his parable, and said, 

{29:2} Oh thatI were as [in] months past, as [in] the days [when] God preserved me;

{29:3} When his candle shined upon my head, [and when] by his light Iwalked [through] darkness; 

{29:4} As I was in the days of my youth,when the secret of God [was] upon my tabernacle; 

{29:5} When theAlmighty [was] yet with me, [when] my children [were] about me; 

{29:6}When I washed my steps with butter, and the rock poured me out riversof oil; 

{29:7} When I went out to the gate through the city, [when] Iprepared my seat in the street! 

{29:8} The young men saw me, and hidthemselves: and the aged arose, [and] stood up. 

{29:9} The princesrefrained talking, and laid [their] hand on their mouth. 

{29:10} Thenobles held their peace, and their tongue cleaved to the roof of theirmouth. 

{29:11} When the ear heard [me,] then it blessed me; and whenthe eye saw [me,] it gave witness to me: 

{29:12} Because I deliveredthe poor that cried, and the fatherless, and [him that had] none tohelp him. 

{29:13} The blessing of him that was ready to perish cameupon me: and I caused the widow's heart to sing for joy. 

{29:14} I puton righteousness, and it clothed me: my judgment [was] as a robe and adiadem. 

{29:15} I was eyes to the blind, and feet [was] I to the lame.

{29:16} I [was] a father to the poor: and the cause [which] I knew notI searched out. 

{29:17} And I brake the jaws of the wicked, and pluckedthe spoil out of his teeth. 

{29:18} Then I said, I shall die in mynest, and I shall multiply [my] days as the sand. 

{29:19} My root [was]spread out by the waters, and the dew lay all night upon my branch.

{29:20} My glory [was] fresh in me, and my bow was renewed in my hand.

{29:21} Unto me [men] gave ear, and waited, and kept silence at mycounsel. 

{29:22} After my words they spake not again; and my speechdropped upon them. 

{29:23} And they waited for me as for the rain; andthey opened their mouth wide [as] for the latter rain. 

{29:24} [If] Ilaughed on them, they believed [it] not; and the light of mycountenance they cast not down. 

{29:25} I chose out their way, and satchief, and dwelt as a king in the army, as one [that] comforteth themourners.   

{30:1} But now [they that are] younger than I have me in derision,whose fathers I would have disdained to have set with the dogs of myflock. 

{30:2} Yea, whereto [might] the strength of their hands [profit]me, in whom old age was perished? 

{30:3} For want and famine [theywere] solitary; fleeing into the wilderness in former time desolate andwaste. 

{30:4} Who cut up mallows by the bushes, and juniper roots [for]their meat. 

{30:5} They were driven forth from among [men,] (they criedafter them as [after] a thief;) 

{30:6} To dwell in the cliffs of thevalleys, [in] caves of the earth, and [in] the rocks. 

{30:7} Among thebushes they brayed; under the nettles they were gathered together.

{30:8} [They were] children of fools, yea, children of base men: theywere viler than the earth. 

{30:9} And now am I their song, yea, I amtheir byword. 

{30:10} They abhor me, they flee far from me, and sparenot to spit in my face. 

{30:11} Because he hath loosed my cord, andafflicted me, they have also let loose the bridle before me. 

{30:12}Upon [my] right [hand] rise the youth; they push away my feet, and theyraise up against me the ways of their destruction. 

{30:13} They mar mypath, they set forward my calamity, they have no helper. 

{30:14} Theycame [upon me] as a wide breaking in [of waters:] in the desolationthey rolled themselves [upon me. ]

{30:15} Terrors are turned upon me:they pursue my soul as the wind: and my welfare passeth away as acloud. 

{30:16} And now my soul is poured out upon me; the days ofaffliction have taken hold upon me. 

{30:17} My bones are pierced in mein the night season: and my sinews take no rest. 

{30:18} By the greatforce [of my disease] is my garment changed: it bindeth me about as thecollar of my coat. 

{30:19} He hath cast me into the mire, and I ambecome like dust and ashes. 

{30:20} I cry unto thee, and thou dost nothear me: I stand up, and thou regardest me [not. ]

{30:21} Thou artbecome cruel to me: with thy strong hand thou opposest thyself againstme. 

{30:22} Thou liftest me up to the wind; thou causest me to ride[upon it,] and dissolvest my substance. 

{30:23} For I know [that] thouwilt bring me [to] death, and [to] the house appointed for all living.

{30:24} Howbeit he will not stretch out [his] hand to the grave, thoughthey cry in his destruction. 

{30:25} Did not I weep for him that was introuble? was [not] my soul grieved for the poor? 

{30:26} When I lookedfor good, then evil came [unto me:] and when I waited for light, therecame darkness. 

{30:27} My bowels boiled, and rested not: the days ofaffliction prevented me. 

{30:28} I went mourning without the sun: Istood up, [and] I cried in the congregation. 

{30:29} I am a brother todragons, and a companion to owls. 

{30:30} My skin is black upon me, andmy bones are burned with heat. 

{30:31} My harp also is [turned] tomourning, and my organ into the voice of them that weep.   

{31:1} I made a covenant with mine eyes; why then should I thinkupon a maid? 

{31:2} For what portion of God [is there] from above? and[what] inheritance of the Almighty from on high? 

{31:3} [Is] notdestruction to the wicked? and a strange [punishment] to the workers ofiniquity? 

{31:4} Doth not he see my ways, and count all my steps?

{31:5} If I have walked with vanity, or if my foot hath hasted todeceit; 

{31:6} Let me be weighed in an even balance, that God may knowmine integrity. 

{31:7} If my step hath turned out of the way, and mineheart walked after mine eyes, and if any blot hath cleaved to minehands; 

{31:8} [Then] let me sow, and let another eat; yea, let myoffspring be rooted out. 

{31:9} If mine heart have been deceived by awoman, or [if] I have laid wait at my neighbour's door; 

{31:10} [Then]let my wife grind unto another, and let others bow down upon her.

{31:11} For this [is] an heinous crime; yea, it [is] an iniquity [to bepunished by] the judges. 

{31:12} For it [is] a fire [that] consumeth todestruction, and would root out all mine increase. 

{31:13} If I diddespise the cause of my manservant or of my maidservant, when theycontended with me; 

{31:14} What then shall I do when God riseth up? andwhen he visiteth, what shall I answer him? 

{31:15} Did not he that mademe in the womb make him? and did not one fashion us in the womb?

{31:16} If I have withheld the poor from [their] desire, or have causedthe eyes of the widow to fail; 

{31:17} Or have eaten my morsel myselfalone, and the fatherless hath not eaten thereof; 

{31:18} (For from myyouth he was brought up with me, as [with] a father, and I have guidedher from my mother's womb;) 

{31:19} If I have seen any perish for wantof clothing, or any poor without covering; 

{31:20} If his loins havenot blessed me, and [if] he were [not] warmed with the fleece of mysheep; 

{31:21} If I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless, whenI saw my help in the gate: 

{31:22} [Then] let mine arm fall from myshoulder blade, and mine arm be broken from the bone. 

{31:23} Fordestruction [from] God [was] a terror to me, and by reason of hishighness I could not endure. 

{31:24} If I have made gold my hope, orhave said to the fine gold, [Thou art] my confidence; 

{31:25} If Irejoiced because my wealth [was] great, and because mine hand hadgotten much; 

{31:26} If I beheld the sun when it shined, or the moonwalking [in] brightness; 

{31:27} And my heart hath been secretlyenticed, or my mouth hath kissed my hand: 

{31:28} This also [were] aniniquity [to be punished by] the judge: for I should have denied theGod [that is] above. 

{31:29} If I rejoiced at the destruction of himthat hated me, or lifted up myself when evil found him: 

{31:30} Neitherhave I suffered my mouth to sin by wishing a curse to his soul. 

{31:31}If the men of my tabernacle said not, Oh that we had of his flesh! wecannot be satisfied. 

{31:32} The stranger did not lodge in the street:[but] I opened my doors to the traveller. 

{31:33} If I covered mytransgressions as Adam, by hiding mine iniquity in my bosom: 

{31:34}Did I fear a great multitude, or did the contempt of families terrifyme, that I kept silence, [and] went not out of the door? 

{31:35} Ohthat one would hear me! behold, my desire [is, that] the Almighty wouldanswer me, and [that] mine adversary had written a book. 

{31:36} SurelyI would take it upon my shoulder, [and] bind it [as] a crown to me.

{31:37} I would declare unto him the number of my steps; as a princewould I go near unto him. 

{31:38} If my land cry against me, or thatthe furrows likewise thereof complain; 

{31:39} If I have eaten thefruits thereof without money, or have caused the owners thereof to losetheir life: 

{31:40} Let thistles grow instead of wheat, and cockleinstead of barley. The words of Job are ended.   

{32:1} So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he [was]righteous in his own eyes. 

{32:2} Then was kindled the wrath of Elihuthe son of Barachel the Buzite, of the kindred of Ram: against Job washis wrath kindled, because he justified himself rather than God. 

{32:3}Also against his three friends was his wrath kindled, because they hadfound no answer, and yet had condemned Job. 

{32:4} Now Elihu had waitedtill Job had spoken, because they were elder than he. 

{32:5} When Elihusaw that [there was] no answer in the mouth of [these] three men, thenhis wrath was kindled. 

{32:6} And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buziteanswered and said, I [am] young, and ye [are] very old; wherefore I wasafraid, and durst not shew you mine opinion. 

{32:7} I said, Days shouldspeak, and multitude of years should teach wisdom. 

{32:8} But [thereis] a spirit in man: and the inspiration of the Almighty giveth themunderstanding. 

{32:9} Great men are not [always] wise: neither do theaged understand judgment. 

{32:10} Therefore I said, Hearken to me; Ialso will shew mine opinion. 

{32:11} Behold, I waited for your words; Igave ear to your reasons, whilst ye searched out what to say. 

{32:12}Yea, I attended unto you, and, behold, [there was] none of you thatconvinced Job, or that answered his words: 

{32:13} Lest ye should say,We have found out wisdom: God thrusteth him down, not man. 

{32:14} Nowhe hath not directed [his] words against me: neither will I answer himwith your speeches. 

{32:15} They were amazed, they answered no more:they left off speaking. 

{32:16} When I had waited, (for they spake not,but stood still, [and] answered no more;) 

{32:17} [I said,] I willanswer also my part, I also will shew mine opinion. 

{32:18} For I amfull of matter, the spirit within me constraineth me. 

{32:19} Behold,my belly [is] as wine [which] hath no vent; it is ready to burst likenew bottles. 

{32:20} I will speak, that I may be refreshed: I will openmy lips and answer. 

{32:21} Let me not, I pray you, accept any man'sperson, neither let me give flattering titles unto man. 

{32:22} For Iknow not to give flattering titles; [in so doing] my maker would soontake me away.   

{33:1} Wherefore, Job, I pray thee, hear my speeches, and hearken toall my words. 

{33:2} Behold, now I have opened my mouth, my tongue hathspoken in my mouth. 

{33:3} My words [shall be of] the uprightness of myheart: and my lips shall utter knowledge clearly. 

{33:4} The Spirit ofGod hath made me, and the breath of the Almighty hath given me life.

{33:5} If thou canst answer me, set [thy words] in order before me,stand up. 

{33:6} Behold, I [am] according to thy wish in God's stead: Ialso am formed out of the clay. 

{33:7} Behold, my terror shall not makethee afraid, neither shall my hand be heavy upon thee. 

{33:8} Surelythou hast spoken in mine hearing, and I have heard the voice of [thy]words, [saying, ]

{33:9} I am clean without transgression, I [am]innocent; neither [is there] iniquity in me. 

{33:10} Behold, he findethoccasions against me, he counteth me for his enemy, 

{33:11} He puttethmy feet in the stocks, he marketh all my paths. 

{33:12} Behold, [in]this thou art not just: I will answer thee, that God is greater thanman. 

{33:13} Why dost thou strive against him? for he giveth notaccount of any of his matters. 

{33:14} For God speaketh once, yeatwice, [yet man] perceiveth it not. 

{33:15} In a dream, in a vision ofthe night, when deep sleep falleth upon men, in slumberings upon thebed; 

{33:16} Then he openeth the ears of men, and sealeth theirinstruction, 

{33:17} That he may withdraw man [from his] purpose, andhide pride from man. 

{33:18} He keepeth back his soul from the pit, andhis life from perishing by the sword. 

{33:19} He is chastened also withpain upon his bed, and the multitude of his bones with strong [pain:]

{33:20} So that his life abhorreth bread, and his soul dainty meat.

{33:21} His flesh is consumed away, that it cannot be seen; and hisbones [that] were not seen stick out. 

{33:22} Yea, his soul drawethnear unto the grave, and his life to the destroyers. 

{33:23} If therebe a messenger with him, an interpreter, one among a thousand, to shewunto man his uprightness: 

{33:24} Then he is gracious unto him, andsaith, Deliver him from going down to the pit: I have found a ransom.

{33:25} His flesh shall be fresher than a child's: he shall return tothe days of his youth: 

{33:26} He shall pray unto God, and he will befavourable unto him: and he shall see his face with joy: for he willrender unto man his righteousness. 

{33:27} He looketh upon men, and [ifany] say, I have sinned, and perverted [that which was] right, and itprofited me not; 

{33:28} He will deliver his soul from going into thepit, and his life shall see the light. 

{33:29} Lo, all these [things]worketh God oftentimes with man, 

{33:30} To bring back his soul fromthe pit, to be enlightened with the light of the living. 

{33:31} Markwell, O Job, hearken unto me: hold thy peace, and I will speak. 

{33:32}If thou hast any thing to say, answer me: speak, for I desire tojustify thee. 

{33:33} If not, hearken unto me: hold thy peace, and Ishall teach thee wisdom.   

{34:1} Furthermore Elihu answered and said, 

{34:2} Hear my words, Oye wise [men;] and give ear unto me, ye that have knowledge. 

{34:3} Forthe ear trieth words, as the mouth tasteth meat. 

{34:4} Let us chooseto us judgment: let us know among ourselves what [is] good. 

{34:5} ForJob hath said, I am righteous: and God hath taken away my judgment.

{34:6} Should I lie against my right? my wound [is] incurable withouttransgression. 

{34:7} What man [is] like Job, [who] drinketh upscorning like water? 

{34:8} Which goeth in company with the workers ofiniquity, and walketh with wicked men. 

{34:9} For he hath said, Itprofiteth a man nothing that he should delight himself with God.

{34:10} Therefore hearken unto me, ye men of understanding: far be itfrom God, [that he should do] wickedness; and [from] the Almighty,[that he should commit] iniquity. 

{34:11} For the work of a man shallhe render unto him, and cause every man to find according to [his]ways. 

{34:12} Yea, surely God will not do wickedly, neither will theAlmighty pervert judgment. 

{34:13} Who hath given him a charge over theearth? or who hath disposed the whole world? 

{34:14} If he set hisheart upon man, [if] he gather unto himself his spirit and his breath;

{34:15} All flesh shall perish together, and man shall turn again untodust. 

{34:16} If now [thou hast] understanding, hear this: hearken tothe voice of my words. 

{34:17} Shall even he that hateth right govern?and wilt thou condemn him that is most just? 

{34:18} [Is it fit] to sayto a king, [Thou art] wicked? [and] to princes, [Ye are] ungodly?

{34:19} [How much less to him] that accepteth not the persons ofprinces, nor regardeth the rich more than the poor? for they all [are]the work of his hands. 

{34:20} In a moment shall they die, and thepeople shall be troubled at midnight, and pass away: and the mightyshall be taken away without hand. 

{34:21} For his eyes [are] upon theways of man, and he seeth all his goings. 

{34:22} [There is] nodarkness, nor shadow of death, where the workers of iniquity may hidethemselves. 

{34:23} For he will not lay upon man more [than right;]that he should enter into judgment with God. 

{34:24} He shall break inpieces mighty men without number, and set others in their stead.

{34:25} Therefore he knoweth their works, and he overturneth [them] inthe night, so that they are destroyed. 

{34:26} He striketh them aswicked men in the open sight of others; 

{34:27} Because they turnedback from him, and would not consider any of his ways: 

{34:28} So thatthey cause the cry of the poor to come unto him, and he heareth the cryof the afflicted. 

{34:29} When he giveth quietness, who then can maketrouble? and when he hideth [his] face, who then can behold him?whether [it be done] against a nation, or against a man only: 

{34:30}That the hypocrite reign not, lest the people be ensnared. 

{34:31}Surely it is meet to be said unto God, I have borne [chastisement,] Iwill not offend [any more: ]

{34:32} [That which] I see not teach thoume: if I have done iniquity, I will do no more. 

{34:33} [Should it be]according to thy mind? he will recompense it, whether thou refuse, orwhether thou choose; and not I: therefore speak what thou knowest.

{34:34} Let men of understanding tell me, and let a wise man hearkenunto me. 

{34:35} Job hath spoken without knowledge, and his words[were] without wisdom. 

{34:36} My desire [is that] Job may be triedunto the end because of [his] answers for wicked men. 

{34:37} For headdeth rebellion unto his sin, he clappeth [his hands] among us, andmultiplieth his words against God.   

{35:1} Elihu spake moreover, and said, 

{35:2} Thinkest thou this tobe right, [that] thou saidst, My righteousness [is] more than God's?

{35:3} For thou saidst, What advantage will it be unto thee? [and,]What profit shall I have, [if I be cleansed] from my sin? 

{35:4} I willanswer thee, and thy companions with thee. 

{35:5} Look unto theheavens, and see; and behold the clouds [which] are higher than thou.

{35:6} If thou sinnest, what doest thou against him? or [if] thytransgressions be multiplied, what doest thou unto him? 

{35:7} If thoube righteous, what givest thou him? or what receiveth he of thine hand?

{35:8} Thy wickedness [may hurt] a man as thou [art;] and thyrighteousness [may profit] the son of man. 

{35:9} By reason of themultitude of oppressions they make [the oppressed] to cry: they cry outby reason of the arm of the mighty. 

{35:10} But none saith, Where [is]God my maker, who giveth songs in the night; 

{35:11} Who teacheth usmore than the beasts of the earth, and maketh us wiser than the fowlsof heaven? 

{35:12} There they cry, but none giveth answer, because ofthe pride of evil men. 

{35:13} Surely God will not hear vanity, neitherwill the Almighty regard it. 

{35:14} Although thou sayest thou shaltnot see him, [yet] judgment [is] before him; therefore trust thou inhim. 

{35:15} But now, because [it is] not [so,] he hath visited in hisanger; yet he knoweth [it] not in great extremity: 

{35:16} Thereforedoth Job open his mouth in vain; he multiplieth words without knowledge.   

{36:1} Elihu also proceeded, and said, 

{36:2} Suffer me a little,and I will shew thee that [I have] yet to speak on God's behalf. 

{36:3}I will fetch my knowledge from afar, and will ascribe righteousness tomy Maker. 

{36:4} For truly my words [shall] not [be] false: he that isperfect in knowledge [is] with thee. 

{36:5} Behold, God [is] mighty,and despiseth not [any: he is] mighty in strength [and] wisdom. 

{36:6}He preserveth not the life of the wicked: but giveth right to the poor.

{36:7} He withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous: but with kings[are they] on the throne; yea, he doth establish them for ever, andthey are exalted. 

{36:8} And if [they be] bound in fetters, [and] beholden in cords of affliction; 

{36:9} Then he sheweth them their work,and their transgressions that they have exceeded. 

{36:10} He openethalso their ear to discipline, and commandeth that they return frominiquity. 

{36:11} If they obey and serve [him,] they shall spend theirdays in prosperity, and their years in pleasures. 

{36:12} But if theyobey not, they shall perish by the sword, and they shall die withoutknowledge. 

{36:13} But the hypocrites in heart heap up wrath: they crynot when he bindeth them. 

{36:14} They die in youth, and their life[is] among the unclean. 

{36:15} He delivereth the poor in hisaffliction, and openeth their ears in oppression. 

{36:16} Even so wouldhe have removed thee out of the strait [into] a broad place, where[there is] no straitness; and that which [should be] set on thy tableshould be full of fatness. 

{36:17} But thou hast fulfilled the judgmentof the wicked: judgment and justice take hold [on thee. ]

{36:18}Because [there is] wrath, [beware] lest he take thee away with [his]stroke: then a great ransom cannot deliver thee. 

{36:19} Will he esteemthy riches? [no,] not gold, nor all the forces of strength. 

{36:20}Desire not the night, when people are cut off in their place. 

{36:21}Take heed, regard not iniquity: for this hast thou chosen rather thanaffliction. 

{36:22} Behold, God exalteth by his power: who teachethlike him? 

{36:23} Who hath enjoined him his way? or who can say, Thouhast wrought iniquity? 

{36:24} Remember that thou magnify his work,which men behold. 

{36:25} Every man may see it; man may behold [it]afar off. 

{36:26} Behold, God [is] great, and we know [him] not,neither can the number of his years be searched out. 

{36:27} For hemaketh small the drops of water: they pour down rain according to thevapour thereof: 

{36:28} Which the clouds do drop [and] distil upon manabundantly. 

{36:29} Also can [any] understand the spreadings of theclouds, [or] the noise of his tabernacle? 

{36:30} Behold, he spreadethhis light upon it, and covereth the bottom of the sea. 

{36:31} For bythem judgeth he the people; he giveth meat in abundance. 

{36:32} Withclouds he covereth the light; and commandeth it [not to shine] by [thecloud] that cometh betwixt. 

{36:33} The noise thereof shewethconcerning it, the cattle also concerning the vapour.   

{37:1} At this also my heart trembleth, and is moved out of hisplace. 

{37:2} Hear attentively the noise of his voice, and the sound[that] goeth out of his mouth. 

{37:3} He directeth it under the wholeheaven, and his lightning unto the ends of the earth. 

{37:4} After it avoice roareth: he thundereth with the voice of his excellency; and hewill not stay them when his voice is heard. 

{37:5} God thunderethmarvellously with his voice; great things doeth he, which we cannotcomprehend. 

{37:6} For he saith to the snow, Be thou [on] the earth;likewise to the small rain, and to the great rain of his strength.

{37:7} He sealeth up the hand of every man; that all men may know hiswork. 

{37:8} Then the beasts go into dens, and remain in their places.

{37:9} Out of the south cometh the whirlwind: and cold out of thenorth. 

{37:10} By the breath of God frost is given: and the breadth ofthe waters is straitened. 

{37:11} Also by watering he wearieth thethick cloud: he scattereth his bright cloud: 

{37:12} And it is turnedround about by his counsels: that they may do whatsoever he commandeththem upon the face of the world in the earth. 

{37:13} He causeth it tocome, whether for correction, or for his land, or for mercy. 

{37:14}Hearken unto this, O Job: stand still, and consider the wondrous worksof God. 

{37:15} Dost thou know when God disposed them, and caused thelight of his cloud to shine? 

{37:16} Dost thou know the balancings ofthe clouds, the wondrous works of him which is perfect in knowledge?

{37:17} How thy garments [are] warm, when he quieteth the earth by thesouth [wind? ]

{37:18} Hast thou with him spread out the sky, [which is]strong, [and] as a molten looking glass? 

{37:19} Teach us what we shallsay unto him; [for] we cannot order [our speech] by reason of darkness.

{37:20} Shall it be told him that I speak? if a man speak, surely heshall be swallowed up. 

{37:21} And now [men] see not the bright lightwhich is in the clouds: but the wind passeth, and cleanseth them.

{37:22} Fair weather cometh out of the north: with God is terriblemajesty. 

{37:23} [Touching] the Almighty, we cannot find him out: [heis] excellent in power, and in judgment, and in plenty of justice: hewill not afflict. 

{37:24} Men do therefore fear him: he respecteth notany [that are] wise of heart.   

{38:1} Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said,

{38:2} Who [is] this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge?

{38:3} Gird up now thy loins like a man; for I will demand of thee, andanswer thou me. 

{38:4} Where wast thou when I laid the foundations ofthe earth? declare, if thou hast understanding. 

{38:5} Who hath laidthe measures thereof, if thou knowest? or who hath stretched the lineupon it? 

{38:6} Whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened? or wholaid the corner stone thereof; 

{38:7} When the morning stars sangtogether, and all the sons of God shouted for joy? 

{38:8} Or [who] shutup the sea with doors, when it brake forth, [as if] it had issued outof the womb? 

{38:9} When I made the cloud the garment thereof, andthick darkness a swaddlingband for it, 

{38:10} And brake up for it mydecreed [place,] and set bars and doors, 

{38:11} And said, Hithertoshalt thou come, but no further: and here shall thy proud waves bestayed? 

{38:12} Hast thou commanded the morning since thy days; [and]caused the dayspring to know his place; 

{38:13} That it might take holdof the ends of the earth, that the wicked might be shaken out of it?

{38:14} It is turned as clay [to] the seal; and they stand as agarment. 

{38:15} And from the wicked their light is withholden, and thehigh arm shall be broken. 

{38:16} Hast thou entered into the springs ofthe sea? or hast thou walked in the search of the depth? 

{38:17} Havethe gates of death been opened unto thee? or hast thou seen the doorsof the shadow of death? 

{38:18} Hast thou perceived the breadth of theearth? declare if thou knowest it all. 

{38:19} Where [is] the way[where] light dwelleth? and [as for] darkness, where [is] the placethereof, 

{38:20} That thou shouldest take it to the bound thereof, andthat thou shouldest know the paths [to] the house thereof? 

{38:21}Knowest thou [it,] because thou wast then born? or [because] the numberof thy days [is] great? 

{38:22} Hast thou entered into the treasures ofthe snow? or hast thou seen the treasures of the hail, 

{38:23} Which Ihave reserved against the time of trouble, against the day of battleand war? 

{38:24} By what way is the light parted, [which] scattereththe east wind upon the earth? 

{38:25} Who hath divided a watercoursefor the overflowing of waters, or a way for the lightning of thunder;

{38:26} To cause it to rain on the earth, [where] no man [is; on] thewilderness, wherein [there is] no man; 

{38:27} To satisfy the desolateand waste [ground;] and to cause the bud of the tender herb to springforth? 

{38:28} Hath the rain a father? or who hath begotten the dropsof dew? 

{38:29} Out of whose womb came the ice? and the hoary frost ofheaven, who hath gendered it? 

{38:30} The waters are hid as [with] astone, and the face of the deep is frozen. 

{38:31} Canst thou bind thesweet influences of Pleiades, or loose the bands of Orion? 

{38:32}Canst thou bring forth Mazzaroth in his season? or canst thou guideArcturus with his sons? 

{38:33} Knowest thou the ordinances of heaven?canst thou set the dominion thereof in the earth? 

{38:34} Canst thoulift up thy voice to the clouds, that abundance of waters may coverthee? 

{38:35} Canst thou send lightnings, that they may go, and sayunto thee, Here we [are? ]

{38:36} Who hath put wisdom in the inwardparts? or who hath given understanding to the heart? 

{38:37} Who cannumber the clouds in wisdom? or who can stay the bottles of heaven,

{38:38} When the dust groweth into hardness, and the clods cleave fasttogether? 

{38:39} Wilt thou hunt the prey for the lion? or fill theappetite of the young lions, 

{38:40} When they couch in [their] dens,[and] abide in the covert to lie in wait? 

{38:41} Who provideth for theraven his food? when his young ones cry unto God, they wander for lackof meat.   

{39:1} Knowest thou the time when the wild goats of the rock bringforth? [or] canst thou mark when the hinds do calve? 

{39:2} Canst thounumber the months [that] they fulfil? or knowest thou the time whenthey bring forth? 

{39:3} They bow themselves, they bring forth theiryoung ones, they cast out their sorrows. 

{39:4} Their young ones are ingood liking, they grow up with corn; they go forth, and return not untothem. 

{39:5} Who hath sent out the wild ass free? or who hath loosedthe bands of the wild ass? 

{39:6} Whose house I have made thewilderness, and the barren land his dwellings. 

{39:7} He scorneth themultitude of the city, neither regardeth he the crying of the driver.

{39:8} The range of the mountains [is] his pasture, and he searchethafter every green thing. 

{39:9} Will the unicorn be willing to servethee, or abide by thy crib? 

{39:10} Canst thou bind the unicorn withhis band in the furrow? or will he harrow the valleys after thee?

{39:11} Wilt thou trust him, because his strength [is] great? or wiltthou leave thy labour to him? 

{39:12} Wilt thou believe him, that hewill bring home thy seed, and gather [it into] thy barn? 

{39:13}[Gavest thou] the goodly wings unto the peacocks? or wings and feathersunto the ostrich? 

{39:14} Which leaveth her eggs in the earth, andwarmeth them in dust, 

{39:15} And forgetteth that the foot may crushthem, or that the wild beast may break them. 

{39:16} She is hardenedagainst her young ones, as though [they were] not hers: her labour isin vain without fear; 

{39:17} Because God hath deprived her of wisdom,neither hath he imparted to her understanding. 

{39:18} What time shelifteth up herself on high, she scorneth the horse and his rider.

{39:19} Hath thou given the horse strength? hast thou clothed his neckwith thunder? 

{39:20} Canst thou make him afraid as a grasshopper? theglory of his nostrils [is] terrible. 

{39:21} He paweth in the valley,and rejoiceth in [his] strength: he goeth on to meet the armed men.

{39:22} He mocketh at fear, and is not affrighted; neither turneth heback from the sword. 

{39:23} The quiver rattleth against him, theglittering spear and the shield. 

{39:24} He swalloweth the ground withfierceness and rage: neither believeth he that [it is] the sound of thetrumpet. 

{39:25} He saith among the trumpets, Ha, ha; and he smelleththe battle afar off, the thunder of the captains, and the shouting.

{39:26} Doth the hawk fly by thy wisdom, [and] stretch her wings towardthe south? 

{39:27} Doth the eagle mount up at thy command, and make hernest on high? 

{39:28} She dwelleth and abideth on the rock, upon thecrag of the rock, and the strong place. 

{39:29} From thence she seekeththe prey, [and] her eyes behold afar off. 

{39:30} Her young ones alsosuck up blood: and where the slain [are,] there [is] she.   

{40:1} Moreover the LORD answered Job, and said, 

{40:2} Shall hethat contendeth with the Almighty instruct [him?] he that reprovethGod, let him answer it.   

{40:3} Then Job answered the LORD, and said, 

{40:4} Behold, I amvile; what shall I answer thee? I will lay mine hand upon my mouth.

{40:5} Once have I spoken; but I will not answer: yea, twice; but Iwill proceed no further.   

{40:6} Then answered the LORD unto Job out of the whirlwind, andsaid, 

{40:7} Gird up thy loins now like a man: I will demand of thee,and declare thou unto me. 

{40:8} Wilt thou also disannul my judgment?wilt thou condemn me, that thou mayest be righteous? 

{40:9} Hast thouan arm like God? or canst thou thunder with a voice like him? 

{40:10}Deck thyself now [with] majesty and excellency; and array thyself withglory and beauty. 

{40:11} Cast abroad the rage of thy wrath: and beholdevery one [that is] proud, and abase him. 

{40:12} Look on every one[that is] proud, [and] bring him low; and tread down the wicked intheir place. 

{40:13} Hide them in the dust together; [and] bind theirfaces in secret. 

{40:14} Then will I also confess unto thee that thineown right hand can save thee.   

{40:15} Behold now behemoth, which I made with thee; he eateth grassas an ox. 

{40:16} Lo now, his strength [is] in his loins, and his force[is] in the navel of his belly. 

{40:17} He moveth his tail like acedar: the sinews of his stones are wrapped together. 

{40:18} His bones[are as] strong pieces of brass; his bones [are] like bars of iron.

{40:19} He [is] the chief of the ways of God: he that made him can makehis sword to approach [unto him. ]

{40:20} Surely the mountains bringhim forth food, where all the beasts of the field play. 

{40:21} Helieth under the shady trees, in the covert of the reed, and fens.

{40:22} The shady trees cover him [with] their shadow; the willows ofthe brook compass him about. 

{40:23} Behold, he drinketh up a river,[and] hasteth not: he trusteth that he can draw up Jordan into hismouth. 

{40:24} He taketh it with his eyes: [his] nose pierceth throughsnares.   

{41:1} Canst thou draw out leviathan with an hook? or his tonguewith a cord [which] thou lettest down? 

{41:2} Canst thou put an hookinto his nose? or bore his jaw through with a thorn? 

{41:3} Will hemake many supplications unto thee? will he speak soft [words] untothee? 

{41:4} Will he make a covenant with thee? wilt thou take him fora servant for ever? 

{41:5} Wilt thou play with him as [with] a bird? orwilt thou bind him for thy maidens? 

{41:6} Shall the companions make abanquet of him? shall they part him among the merchants? 

{41:7} Canstthou fill his skin with barbed irons? or his head with fish spears?

{41:8} Lay thine hand upon him, remember the battle, do no more. 

{41:9}Behold, the hope of him is in vain: shall not [one] be cast down evenat the sight of him? 

{41:10} None [is so] fierce that dare stir him up:who then is able to stand before me? 

{41:11} Who hath prevented me,that I should repay [him? whatsoever is] under the whole heaven ismine. 

{41:12} I will not conceal his parts, nor his power, nor hiscomely proportion. 

{41:13} Who can discover the face of his garment?[or] who can come [to him] with his double bridle? 

{41:14} Who can openthe doors of his face? his teeth [are] terrible round about. 

{41:15}[His] scales [are his] pride, shut up together [as with] a close seal.

{41:16} One is so near to another, that no air can come between them.

{41:17} They are joined one to another, they stick together, that theycannot be sundered. 

{41:18} By his neesings a light doth shine, and hiseyes [are] like the eyelids of the morning. 

{41:19} Out of his mouth goburning lamps, [and] sparks of fire leap out. 

{41:20} Out of hisnostrils goeth smoke, as [out] of a seething pot or caldron. 

{41:21}His breath kindleth coals, and a flame goeth out of his mouth. 

{41:22}In his neck remaineth strength, and sorrow is turned into joy beforehim. 

{41:23} The flakes of his flesh are joined together: they are firmin themselves; they cannot be moved. 

{41:24} His heart is as firm as astone; yea, as hard as a piece of the nether [millstone. ]

{41:25} Whenhe raiseth up himself, the mighty are afraid: by reason of breakingsthey purify themselves. 

{41:26} The sword of him that layeth at himcannot hold: the spear, the dart, nor the habergeon. 

{41:27} Heesteemeth iron as straw, [and] brass as rotten wood. 

{41:28} The arrowcannot make him flee: slingstones are turned with him into stubble.

{41:29} Darts are counted as stubble: he laugheth at the shaking of aspear. 

{41:30} Sharp stones [are] under him: he spreadeth sharp pointedthings upon the mire. 

{41:31} He maketh the deep to boil like a pot: hemaketh the sea like a pot of ointment. 

{41:32} He maketh a path toshine after him; [one] would think the deep [to be] hoary. 

{41:33} Uponearth there is not his like, who is made without fear. 

{41:34} Hebeholdeth all high [things:] he [is] a king over all the children ofpride.   

{42:1} Then Job answered the LORD, and said, 

{42:2} I know that thoucanst do every [thing,] and [that] no thought can be withholden fromthee. 

{42:3} Who [is] he that hideth counsel without knowledge?therefore have I uttered that I understood not; things too wonderfulfor me, which I knew not. 

{42:4} Hear, I beseech thee, and I willspeak: I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me. 

{42:5} I haveheard of thee by the hearing of the ear: but now mine eye seeth thee.

{42:6} Wherefore I abhor [myself,] and repent in dust and ashes.   

{42:7} And it was [so,] that after the LORD had spoken these wordsunto Job, the LORD said to Eliphaz the Temanite, My wrath is kindledagainst thee, and against thy two friends: for ye have not spoken of me[the thing that is] right, as my servant Job [hath. ]

{42:8} Thereforetake unto you now seven bullocks and seven rams, and go to my servantJob, and offer up for yourselves a burnt offering; and my servant Jobshall pray for you: for him will I accept: lest I deal with you [afteryour] folly, in that ye have not spoken of me [the thing which is]right, like my servant Job. 

{42:9} So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildadthe Shuhite [and] Zophar the Naamathite went, and did according as theLORD commanded them: the LORD also accepted Job. 

{42:10} And the LORDturned the captivity of Job, when he prayed for his friends: also theLORD gave Job twice as much as he had before. 

{42:11} Then came thereunto him all his brethren, and all his sisters, and all they that hadbeen of his acquaintance before, and did eat bread with him in hishouse: and they bemoaned him, and comforted him over all the evil thatthe LORD had brought upon him: every man also gave him a piece ofmoney, and every one an earring of gold. 

{42:12} So the LORD blessedthe latter end of Job more than his beginning: for he had fourteenthousand sheep, and six thousand camels, and a thousand yoke of oxen,and a thousand she asses. 

{42:13} He had also seven sons and threedaughters. 

{42:14} And he called the name of the first, Jemima; and thename of the second, Kezia; and the name of the third, Keren-happuch.

{42:15} And in all the land were no women found [so] fair as thedaughters of Job: and their father gave them inheritance among theirbrethren. 

{42:16} After this lived Job an hundred and forty years, andsaw his sons, and his sons' sons, [even] four generations. 

{42:17} SoJob died, [being] old and full of days.
