{The Second Book of the KingsCommonly Called the Fourth Book of the Kings   

{1:1} Then Moab rebelled against Israel after the death of Ahab.

{1:2} And Ahaziah fell down through a lattice in his upper chamber that[was] in Samaria, and was sick: and he sent messengers, and said untothem, Go, enquire of Baal-zebub the god of Ekron whether I shallrecover of this disease. 

{1:3} But the angel of the LORD said to Elijahthe Tishbite, Arise, go up to meet the messengers of the king ofSamaria, and say unto them, [Is it] not because [there is] not a God inIsrael, [that] ye go to enquire of Baal-zebub the god of Ekron? 

{1:4}Now therefore thus saith the LORD, Thou shalt not come down from thatbed on which thou art gone up, but shalt surely die. And Elijahdeparted.   

{1:5} And when the messengers turned back unto him, he said untothem, Why are ye now turned back? 

{1:6} And they said unto him, Therecame a man up to meet us, and said unto us, Go, turn again unto theking that sent you, and say unto him, Thus saith the LORD, [Is it] notbecause [there is] not a God in Israel, [that] thou sendest to enquireof Baal-zebub the god of Ekron? therefore thou shalt not come down fromthat bed on which thou art gone up, but shalt surely die. 

{1:7} And hesaid unto them, What manner of man [was he] which came up to meet you,and told you these words? 

{1:8} And they answered him, [He was] anhairy man, and girt with a girdle of leather about his loins. And hesaid, It [is] Elijah the Tishbite. 

{1:9} Then the king sent unto him acaptain of fifty with his fifty. And he went up to him: and, behold, hesat on the top of an hill. And he spake unto him, Thou man of God, theking hath said, Come down. 

{1:10} And Elijah answered and said to thecaptain of fifty, If I [be] a man of God, then let fire come down fromheaven, and consume thee and thy fifty. And there came down fire fromheaven, and consumed him and his fifty. 

{1:11} Again also he sent untohim another captain of fifty with his fifty. And he answered and saidunto him, O man of God, thus hath the king said, Come down quickly.

{1:12} And Elijah answered and said unto them, If I [be] a man of God,let fire come down from heaven, and consume thee and thy fifty. And thefire of God came down from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty.   

{1:13} And he sent again a captain of the third fifty with hisfifty. And the third captain of fifty went up, and came and fell on hisknees before Elijah, and besought him, and said unto him, O man of God,I pray thee, let my life, and the life of these fifty thy servants, beprecious in thy sight. 

{1:14} Behold, there came fire down from heaven,and burnt up the two captains of the former fifties with their fifties:therefore let my life now be precious in thy sight. 

{1:15} And theangel of the LORD said unto Elijah, Go down with him: be not afraid ofhim. And he arose, and went down with him unto the king. 

{1:16} And hesaid unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Forasmuch as thou hast sentmessengers to enquire of Baal-zebub the god of Ekron, [is it] notbecause [there is] no God in Israel to enquire of his word? thereforethou shalt not come down off that bed on which thou art gone up, butshalt surely die.   

{1:17} So he died according to the word of the LORD which Elijah hadspoken. And Jehoram reigned in his stead in the second year of Jehoramthe son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah; because he had no son. 

{1:18} Nowthe rest of the acts of Ahaziah which he did, [are] they not written inthe book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?   

{2:1} And it came to pass, when the LORD would take up Elijah intoheaven by a whirlwind, that Elijah went with Elisha from Gilgal. 

{2:2}And Elijah said unto Elisha, Tarry here, I pray thee; for the LORD hathsent me to Bethel. And Elisha said [unto him, As] the LORD liveth, andas thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. So they went down to Bethel.

{2:3} And the sons of the prophets that [were] at Bethel came forth toElisha, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the LORD will take awaythy master from thy head to day? And he said, Yea, I know [it;] hold yeyour peace. 

{2:4} And Elijah said unto him, Elisha, tarry here, I praythee; for the LORD hath sent me to Jericho. And he said, [As] the LORDliveth, and [as] thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. So they cameto Jericho. 

{2:5} And the sons of the prophets that [were] at Jerichocame to Elisha, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the LORD will takeaway thy master from thy head to day? And he answered, Yea, I know[it;] hold ye your peace. 

{2:6} And Elijah said unto him, Tarry, I praythee, here; for the LORD hath sent me to Jordan. And he said, [As] theLORD liveth, and [as] thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. And theytwo went on. 

{2:7} And fifty men of the sons of the prophets went, andstood to view afar off: and they two stood by Jordan. 

{2:8} And Elijahtook his mantle, and wrapped [it] together, and smote the waters, andthey were divided hither and thither, so that they two went over on dryground.   

{2:9} And it came to pass, when they were gone over, that Elijahsaid unto Elisha, Ask what I shall do for thee, before I be taken awayfrom thee. And Elisha said, I pray thee, let a double portion of thyspirit be upon me. 

{2:10} And he said, Thou hast asked a hard thing:[nevertheless,] if thou see me [when I am] taken from thee, it shall beso unto thee; but if not, it shall not be so. 

{2:11} And it came topass, as they still went on, and talked, that, behold, [there appeared]a chariot of fire, and horses of fire, and parted them both asunder;and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven.   

{2:12} And Elisha saw [it,] and he cried, My father, my father, thechariot of Israel, and the horsemen thereof. And he saw him no more:and he took hold of his own clothes, and rent them in two pieces.

{2:13} He took up also the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, andwent back, and stood by the bank of Jordan; 

{2:14} And he took themantle of Elijah that fell from him, and smote the waters, and said,Where [is] the LORD God of Elijah? and when he also had smitten thewaters, they parted hither and thither: and Elisha went over. 

{2:15}And when the sons of the prophets which [were] to view at Jericho sawhim, they said, The spirit of Elijah doth rest on Elisha. And they cameto meet him, and bowed themselves to the ground before him.   

{2:16} And they said unto him, Behold now, there be with thyservants fifty strong men; let them go, we pray thee, and seek thymaster: lest peradventure the Spirit of the LORD hath taken him up, andcast him upon some mountain, or into some valley. And he said, Ye shallnot send. 

{2:17} And when they urged him till he was ashamed, he said,Send. They sent therefore fifty men; and they sought three days, butfound him not. 

{2:18} And when they came again to him, (for he tarriedat Jericho,) he said unto them, Did I not say unto you, Go not?   

{2:19} And the men of the city said unto Elisha, Behold, I praythee, the situation of this city [is] pleasant, as my lord seeth: butthe water [is] naught, and the ground barren. 

{2:20} And he said, Bringme a new cruse, and put salt therein. And they bring [it] to him.

{2:21} And he went forth unto the spring of the waters, and cast thesalt in there, and said, Thus saith the LORD, I have healed thesewaters; there shall not be from thence any more death or barren [land.]

{2:22} So the waters were healed unto this day, according to thesaying of Elisha which he spake.   

{2:23} And he went up from thence unto Bethel: and as he was goingup by the way, there came forth little children out of the city, andmocked him, and said unto him, Go up, thou bald head; go up, thou baldhead. 

{2:24} And he turned back, and looked on them, and cursed them inthe name of the LORD. And there came forth two she bears out of thewood, and tare forty and two children of them. 

{2:25} And he went fromthence to mount Carmel, and from thence he returned to Samaria.   

{3:1} Now Jehoram the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel inSamaria the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reignedtwelve years. 

{3:2} And he wrought evil in the sight of the LORD; butnot like his father, and like his mother: for he put away the image ofBaal that his father had made. 

{3:3} Nevertheless he cleaved unto thesins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, which made Israel to sin; hedeparted not therefrom.   

{3:4} And Mesha king of Moab was a sheepmaster, and rendered untothe king of Israel an hundred thousand lambs, and an hundred thousandrams, with the wool. 

{3:5} But it came to pass, when Ahab was dead,that the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel.   

{3:6} And king Jehoram went out of Samaria the same time, andnumbered all Israel. 

{3:7} And he went and sent to Jehoshaphat the kingof Judah, saying, The king of Moab hath rebelled against me: wilt thougo with me against Moab to battle? And he said, I will go up: I [am] asthou [art,] my people as thy people, [and] my horses as thy horses.

{3:8} And he said, Which way shall we go up? And he answered, The waythrough the wilderness of Edom. 

{3:9} So the king of Israel went, andthe king of Judah, and the king of Edom: and they fetched a compass ofseven days' journey: and there was no water for the host, and for thecattle that followed them. 

{3:10} And the king of Israel said, Alas!that the LORD hath called these three kings together, to deliver theminto the hand of Moab! 

{3:11} But Jehoshaphat said, [Is there] not herea prophet of the LORD, that we may enquire of the LORD by him? And oneof the king of Israel's servants answered and said, Here [is] Elishathe son of Shaphat, which poured water on the hands of Elijah. 

{3:12}And Jehoshaphat said, The word of the LORD is with him. So the king ofIsrael and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to him. 

{3:13}And Elisha said unto the king of Israel, What have I to do with thee?get thee to the prophets of thy father, and to the prophets of thymother. And the king of Israel said unto him, Nay: for the LORD hathcalled these three kings together, to deliver them into the hand ofMoab. 

{3:14} And Elisha said, [As] the LORD of hosts liveth, beforewhom I stand, surely, were it not that I regard the presence ofJehoshaphat the king of Judah, I would not look toward thee, nor seethee. 

{3:15} But now bring me a minstrel. And it came to pass, when theminstrel played, that the hand of the LORD came upon him. 

{3:16} And hesaid, Thus saith the LORD, Make this valley full of ditches. 

{3:17} Forthus saith the LORD, Ye shall not see wind, neither shall ye see rain;yet that valley shall be filled with water, that ye may drink, both ye,and your cattle, and your beasts. 

{3:18} And this is [but] a lightthing in the sight of the LORD: he will deliver the Moabites also intoyour hand. 

{3:19} And ye shall smite every fenced city, and everychoice city, and shall fell every good tree, and stop all wells ofwater, and mar every good piece of land with stones. 

{3:20} And it cameto pass in the morning, when the meat offering was offered, that,behold, there came water by the way of Edom, and the country was filledwith water.   

{3:21} And when all the Moabites heard that the kings were come upto fight against them, they gathered all that were able to put onarmour, and upward, and stood in the border. 

{3:22} And they rose upearly in the morning, and the sun shone upon the water, and theMoabites saw the water on the other side [as] red as blood: 

{3:23} Andthey said, This [is] blood: the kings are surely slain, and they havesmitten one another: now therefore, Moab, to the spoil. 

{3:24} And whenthey came to the camp of Israel, the Israelites rose up and smote theMoabites, so that they fled before them: but they went forward smitingthe Moabites, even in [their] country. 

{3:25} And they beat down thecities, and on every good piece of land cast every man his stone, andfilled it; and they stopped all the wells of water, and felled all thegood trees: only in Kir-haraseth left they the stones thereof; howbeitthe slingers went about [it,] and smote it.   

{3:26} And when the king of Moab saw that the battle was too sorefor him, he took with him seven hundred men that drew swords, to breakthrough [even] unto the king of Edom: but they could not. 

{3:27} Thenhe took his eldest son that should have reigned in his stead, andoffered him [for] a burnt offering upon the wall. And there was greatindignation against Israel: and they departed from him, and returned to[their own] land.   

{4:1} Now there cried a certain woman of the wives of the sons ofthe prophets unto Elisha, saying, Thy servant my husband is dead; andthou knowest that thy servant did fear the LORD: and the creditor iscome to take unto him my two sons to be bondmen. 

{4:2} And Elisha saidunto her, What shall I do for thee? tell me, what hast thou in thehouse? And she said, Thine handmaid hath not any thing in the house,save a pot of oil. 

{4:3} Then he said, Go, borrow thee vessels abroadof all thy neighbours, [even] empty vessels; borrow not a few. 

{4:4}And when thou art come in, thou shalt shut the door upon thee and uponthy sons, and shalt pour out into all those vessels, and thou shalt setaside that which is full. 

{4:5} So she went from him, and shut the doorupon her and upon her sons, who brought [the vessels] to her; and shepoured out. 

{4:6} And it came to pass, when the vessels were full, thatshe said unto her son, Bring me yet a vessel. And he said unto her,[There is] not a vessel more. And the oil stayed. 

{4:7} Then she cameand told the man of God. And he said, Go, sell the oil, and pay thydebt, and live thou and thy children of the rest.   

{4:8} And it fell on a day, that Elisha passed to Shunem, where[was] a great woman; and she constrained him to eat bread. And so itwas, [that] as oft as he passed by, he turned in thither to eat bread.

{4:9} And she said unto her husband, Behold now, I perceive that this[is] an holy man of God, which passeth by us continually. 

{4:10} Let usmake a little chamber, I pray thee, on the wall; and let us set for himthere a bed, and a table, and a stool, and a candlestick: and it shallbe, when he cometh to us, that he shall turn in thither. 

{4:11} And itfell on a day, that he came thither, and he turned into the chamber,and lay there. 

{4:12} And he said to Gehazi his servant, Call thisShunammite. And when he had called her, she stood before him. 

{4:13}And he said unto him, Say now unto her, Behold, thou hast been carefulfor us with all this care; what [is] to be done for thee? wouldest thoube spoken for to the king, or to the captain of the host? And sheanswered, I dwell among mine own people. 

{4:14} And he said, What then[is] to be done for her? And Gehazi answered, Verily she hath no child,and her husband is old. 

{4:15} And he said, Call her. And when he hadcalled her, she stood in the door. 

{4:16} And he said, About thisseason, according to the time of life, thou shalt embrace a son. Andshe said, Nay, my lord, [thou] man of God, do not lie unto thinehandmaid. 

{4:17} And the woman conceived, and bare a son at that seasonthat Elisha had said unto her, according to the time of life.   

{4:18} And when the child was grown, it fell on a day, that he wentout to his father to the reapers. 

{4:19} And he said unto his father,My head, my head. And he said to a lad, Carry him to his mother. 

{4:20}And when he had taken him, and brought him to his mother, he sat on herknees till noon, and [then] died. 

{4:21} And she went up, and laid himon the bed of the man of God, and shut [the door] upon him, and wentout. 

{4:22} And she called unto her husband, and said, Send me, I praythee, one of the young men, and one of the asses, that I may run to theman of God, and come again. 

{4:23} And he said, Wherefore wilt thou goto him to day? [it is] neither new moon, nor sabbath. And she said, [Itshall be] well. 

{4:24} Then she saddled an ass, and said to herservant, Drive, and go forward; slack not [thy] riding for me, except Ibid thee. 

{4:25} So she went and came unto the man of God to mountCarmel. And it came to pass, when the man of God saw her afar off, thathe said to Gehazi his servant, Behold, [yonder is] that Shunammite:

{4:26} Run now, I pray thee, to meet her, and say unto her, [Is it]well with thee? [is it] well with thy husband? [is it] well with thechild? And she answered, [It is] well. 

{4:27} And when she came to theman of God to the hill, she caught him by the feet: but Gehazi camenear to thrust her away. And the man of God said, Let her alone; forher soul [is] vexed within her: and the LORD hath hid [it] from me, andhath not told me. 

{4:28} Then she said, Did I desire a son of my lord?did I not say, Do not deceive me? 

{4:29} Then he said to Gehazi, Girdup thy loins, and take my staff in thine hand, and go thy way: if thoumeet any man, salute him not; and if any salute thee, answer him notagain: and lay my staff upon the face of the child. 

{4:30} And themother of the child said, [As] the LORD liveth, and [as] thy soulliveth, I will not leave thee. And he arose, and followed her. 

{4:31}And Gehazi passed on before them, and laid the staff upon the face ofthe child; but [there was] neither voice, nor hearing. Wherefore hewent again to meet him, and told him, saying, The child is not awaked.

{4:32} And when Elisha was come into the house, behold, the child wasdead, [and] laid upon his bed. 

{4:33} He went in therefore, and shutthe door upon them twain, and prayed unto the LORD. 

{4:34} And he wentup, and lay upon the child, and put his mouth upon his mouth, and hiseyes upon his eyes, and his hands upon his hands: and he stretchedhimself upon the child; and the flesh of the child waxed warm. 

{4:35}Then he returned, and walked in the house to and fro; and went up, andstretched himself upon him: and the child sneezed seven times, and thechild opened his eyes. 

{4:36} And he called Gehazi, and said, Call thisShunammite. So he called her. And when she was come in unto him, hesaid, Take up thy son. 

{4:37} Then she went in, and fell at his feet,and bowed herself to the ground, and took up her son, and went out.   

{4:38} And Elisha came again to Gilgal: and [there was] a dearth inthe land; and the sons of the prophets [were] sitting before him: andhe said unto his servant, Set on the great pot, and seethe pottage forthe sons of the prophets. 

{4:39} And one went out into the field togather herbs, and found a wild vine, and gathered thereof wild gourdshis lap full, and came and shred [them] into the pot of pottage: forthey knew [them] not. 

{4:40} So they poured out for the men to eat. Andit came to pass, as they were eating of the pottage, that they criedout, and said, O [thou] man of God, [there is] death in the pot. Andthey could not eat [thereof. ]

{4:41} But he said, Then bring meal. Andhe cast [it] into the pot; and he said, Pour out for the people, thatthey may eat. And there was no harm in the pot.   

{4:42} And there came a man from Baal-shalisha, and brought the manof God bread of the firstfruits, twenty loaves of barley, and full earsof corn in the husk thereof. And he said, Give unto the people, thatthey may eat. 

{4:43} And his servitor said, What, should I set thisbefore an hundred men? He said again, Give the people, that they mayeat: for thus saith the LORD, They shall eat, and shall leave [thereof.]

{4:44} So he set [it] before them, and they did eat, and left[thereof,] according to the word of the LORD.   

{5:1} Now Naaman, captain of the host of the king of Syria, was agreat man with his master, and honourable, because by him the LORD hadgiven deliverance unto Syria: he was also a mighty man in valour, [buthe was] a leper. 

{5:2} And the Syrians had gone out by companies, andhad brought away captive out of the land of Israel a little maid; andshe waited on Naaman's wife. 

{5:3} And she said unto her mistress,Would God my lord [were] with the prophet that [is] in Samaria! for hewould recover him of his leprosy. 

{5:4} And [one] went in, and told hislord, saying, Thus and thus said the maid that [is] of the land ofIsrael. 

{5:5} And the king of Syria said, Go to, go, and I will send aletter unto the king of Israel. And he departed, and took with him tentalents of silver, and six thousand [pieces] of gold, and ten changesof raiment. 

{5:6} And he brought the letter to the king of Israel,saying, Now when this letter is come unto thee, behold, I have[therewith] sent Naaman my servant to thee, that thou mayest recoverhim of his leprosy. 

{5:7} And it came to pass, when the king of Israelhad read the letter, that he rent his clothes, and said, [Am] I God, tokill and to make alive, that this man doth send unto me to recover aman of his leprosy? wherefore consider, I pray you, and see how heseeketh a quarrel against me.   

{5:8} And it was [so,] when Elisha the man of God had heard that theking of Israel had rent his clothes, that he sent to the king, saying,Wherefore hast thou rent thy clothes? let him come now to me, and heshall know that there is a prophet in Israel. 

{5:9} So Naaman came withhis horses and with his chariot, and stood at the door of the house ofElisha. 

{5:10} And Elisha sent a messenger unto him, saying, Go andwash in the Jordan seven times, and thy flesh shall come again to thee,and thou shalt be clean. 

{5:11} But Naaman was wroth, and went away,and said, Behold, I thought, He will surely come out to me, and stand,and call on the name of the LORD his God, and strike his hand over theplace, and recover the leper. 

{5:12} [Are] not Abana and Pharpar,rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? may I notwash in them, and be clean? So he turned and went away in a rage.

{5:13} And his servants came near, and spake unto him, and said, Myfather, [if] the prophet had bid thee [do some] great thing, wouldestthou not have done [it?] how much rather then, when he saith to thee,Wash, and be clean? 

{5:14} Then went he down, and dipped himself seventimes in Jordan, according to the saying of the man of God: and hisflesh came again like unto the flesh of a little child, and he wasclean.   

{5:15} And he returned to the man of God, he and all his company,and came, and stood before him: and he said, Behold, now I know that[there is] no God in all earth, but in Israel: now therefore, I praythee, take a blessing of thy servant. 

{5:16} But he said, [As] the LORDliveth, before whom I stand, I will receive none. And he urged him totake [it;] but he refused. 

{5:17} And Naaman said, Shall there notthen, I pray thee, be given to thy servant two mules' burden of earth?for thy servant will henceforth offer neither burnt offering norsacrifice unto other gods, but unto the LORD. 

{5:18} In this thing theLORD pardon thy servant, [that] when my master goeth into the house ofRimmon to worship there, and he leaneth on my hand, and I bow myself inthe house of Rimmon: when I bow down myself in the house of Rimmon, theLORD pardon thy servant in this thing. 

{5:19} And he said unto him, Goin peace. So he departed from him a little way.   

{5:20} But Gehazi, the servant of Elisha the man of God, said,Behold, my master hath spared Naaman this Syrian, in not receiving athis hands that which he brought: but, [as] the LORD liveth, I will runafter him, and take somewhat of him. 

{5:21} So Gehazi followed afterNaaman. And when Naaman saw [him] running after him, he lighted downfrom the chariot to meet him, and said, [Is] all well? 

{5:22} And hesaid, All [is] well. My master hath sent me, saying, Behold, even nowthere be come to me from mount Ephraim two young men of the sons of theprophets: give them, I pray thee, a talent of silver, and two changesof garments. 

{5:23} And Naaman said, Be content, take two talents. Andhe urged him, and bound two talents of silver in two bags, with twochanges of garments, and laid [them] upon two of his servants; and theybare [them] before him. 

{5:24} And when he came to the tower, he took[them] from their hand, and bestowed [them] in the house: and he letthe men go, and they departed. 

{5:25} But he went in, and stood beforehis master. And Elisha said unto him, Whence [comest thou,] Gehazi? Andhe said, Thy servant went no whither. 

{5:26} And he said unto him, Wentnot mine heart [with thee,] when the man turned again from his chariotto meet thee? [Is it] a time to receive money, and to receive garments,and oliveyards, and vineyards, and sheep, and oxen, and menservants,and maidservants? 

{5:27} The leprosy therefore of Naaman shall cleaveunto thee, and unto thy seed for ever. And he went out from hispresence a leper [as white] as snow.   

{6:1} And the sons of the prophets said unto Elisha, Behold now, theplace where we dwell with thee is too strait for us. 

{6:2} Let us go,we pray thee, unto Jordan, and take thence every man a beam, and let usmake us a place there, where we may dwell. And he answered, Go ye.

{6:3} And one said, Be content, I pray thee, and go with thy servants.And he answered, I will go. 

{6:4} So he went with them. And when theycame to Jordan, they cut down wood. 

{6:5} But as one was felling abeam, the axe head fell into the water: and he cried, and said, Alas,master! for it was borrowed. 

{6:6} And the man of God said, Where fellit? And he shewed him the place. And he cut down a stick, and cast [it]in thither; and the iron did swim. 

{6:7} Therefore said he, Take [it]up to thee. And he put out his hand, and took it.   

{6:8} Then the king of Syria warred against Israel, and took counselwith his servants, saying, In such and such a place [shall be] my camp.

{6:9} And the man of God sent unto the king of Israel, saying, Bewarethat thou pass not such a place; for thither the Syrians are come down.

{6:10} And the king of Israel sent to the place which the man of Godtold him and warned him of, and saved himself there, not once nortwice. 

{6:11} Therefore the heart of the king of Syria was soretroubled for this thing; and he called his servants, and said untothem, Will ye not shew me which of us [is] for the king of Israel?

{6:12} And one of his servants said, None, my lord, O king: but Elisha,the prophet that [is] in Israel, telleth the king of Israel the wordsthat thou speakest in thy bedchamber.   

{6:13} And he said, Go and spy where he [is,] that I may send andfetch him. And it was told him, saying, Behold, [he is] in Dothan.

{6:14} Therefore sent he thither horses, and chariots, and a greathost: and they came by night, and compassed the city about. 

{6:15} Andwhen the servant of the man of God was risen early, and gone forth,behold, an host compassed the city both with horses and chariots. Andhis servant said unto him, Alas, my master! how shall we do? 

{6:16} Andhe answered, Fear not: for they that [be] with us [are] more than theythat [be] with them. 

{6:17} And Elisha prayed, and said, LORD, I praythee, open his eyes, that he may see. And the LORD opened the eyes ofthe young man; and he saw: and, behold, the mountain [was] full ofhorses and chariots of fire round about Elisha. 

{6:18} And when theycame down to him, Elisha prayed unto the LORD, and said, Smite thispeople, I pray thee, with blindness. And he smote them with blindnessaccording to the word of Elisha.   

{6:19} And Elisha said unto them, This [is] not the way, neither[is] this the city: follow me, and I will bring you to the man whom yeseek. But he led them to Samaria. 

{6:20} And it came to pass, when theywere come into Samaria, that Elisha said, LORD, open the eyes of these[men,] that they may see. And the LORD opened their eyes, and they saw;and, behold, [they were] in the midst of Samaria. 

{6:21} And the kingof Israel said unto Elisha, when he saw them, My father, shall I smite[them?] shall I smite [them? ]

{6:22} And he answered, Thou shalt notsmite [them:] wouldest thou smite those whom thou hast taken captivewith thy sword and with thy bow? set bread and water before them, thatthey may eat and drink, and go to their master. 

{6:23} And he preparedgreat provision for them: and when they had eaten and drunk, he sentthem away, and they went to their master. So the bands of Syria came nomore into the land of Israel.   

{6:24} And it came to pass after this, that Ben-hadad king of Syriagathered all his host, and went up, and besieged Samaria. 

{6:25} Andthere was a great famine in Samaria: and, behold, they besieged it,until an ass's head was [sold] for fourscore [pieces] of silver, andthe fourth part of a cab of dove's dung for five [pieces] of silver.

{6:26} And as the king of Israel was passing by upon the wall, therecried a woman unto him, saying, Help, my lord, O king. 

{6:27} And hesaid, If the LORD do not help thee, whence shall I help thee? out ofthe barnfloor, or out of the winepress? 

{6:28} And the king said untoher, What aileth thee? And she answered, This woman said unto me, Givethy son, that we may eat him to day, and we will eat my son to morrow.

{6:29} So we boiled my son, and did eat him: and I said unto her on thenext day, Give thy son, that we may eat him: and she hath hid her son.   

{6:30} And it came to pass, when the king heard the words of thewoman, that he rent his clothes; and he passed by upon the wall, andthe people looked, and, behold, [he had] sackcloth within upon hisflesh. 

{6:31} Then he said, God do so and more also to me, if the headof Elisha the son of Shaphat shall stand on him this day. 

{6:32} ButElisha sat in his house, and the elders sat with him; and [the king]sent a man from before him: but ere the messenger came to him, he saidto the elders, See ye how this son of a murderer hath sent to take awaymine head? look, when the messenger cometh, shut the door, and hold himfast at the door: [is] not the sound of his master's feet behind him?

{6:33} And while he yet talked with them, behold, the messenger camedown unto him: and he said, Behold, this evil [is] of the LORD; whatshould I wait for the LORD any longer?   

{7:1} Then Elisha said, Hear ye the word of the LORD; Thus saith theLORD, To morrow about this time [shall] a measure of fine flour [besold] for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel, in thegate of Samaria. 

{7:2} Then a lord on whose hand the king leanedanswered the man of God, and said, Behold, [if] the LORD would makewindows in heaven, might this thing be? And he said, Behold, thou shaltsee [it] with thine eyes, but shalt not eat thereof.   

{7:3} And there were four leprous men at the entering in of thegate: and they said one to another, Why sit we here until we die? 

{7:4}If we say, We will enter into the city, then the famine [is] in thecity, and we shall die there: and if we sit still here, we die also.Now therefore come, and let us fall unto the host of the Syrians: ifthey save us alive, we shall live; and if they kill us, we shall butdie. 

{7:5} And they rose up in the twilight, to go unto the camp of theSyrians: and when they were come to the uttermost part of the camp ofSyria, behold, [there was] no man there. 

{7:6} For the Lord had madethe host of the Syrians to hear a noise of chariots, and a noise ofhorses, [even] the noise of a great host: and they said one to another,Lo, the king of Israel hath hired against us the kings of the Hittites,and the kings of the Egyptians, to come upon us. 

{7:7} Wherefore theyarose and fled in the twilight, and left their tents, and their horses,and their asses, even the camp as it [was,] and fled for their life.

{7:8} And when these lepers came to the uttermost part of the camp,they went into one tent, and did eat and drink, and carried thencesilver, and gold, and raiment, and went and hid [it;] and came again,and entered into another tent, and carried thence [also,] and went andhid [it. ]

{7:9} Then they said one to another, We do not well: this day[is] a day of good tidings, and we hold our peace: if we tarry till themorning light, some mischief will come upon us: now therefore come,that we may go and tell the king's household. 

{7:10} So they came andcalled unto the porter of the city: and they told them, saying, We cameto the camp of the Syrians, and, behold, [there was] no man there,neither voice of man, but horses tied, and asses tied, and the tents asthey [were. ]

{7:11} And he called the porters; and they told [it] tothe king's house within.   

{7:12} And the king arose in the night, and said unto his servants,I will now shew you what the Syrians have done to us. They know that we[be] hungry; therefore are they gone out of the camp to hide themselvesin the field, saying, When they come out of the city, we shall catchthem alive, and get into the city. 

{7:13} And one of his servantsanswered and said, Let [some] take, I pray thee, five of the horsesthat remain, which are left in the city, (behold, they [are] as all themultitude of Israel that are left in it: behold, [I say,] they [are]even as all the multitude of the Israelites that are consumed:) and letus send and see. 

{7:14} They took therefore two chariot horses; and theking sent after the host of the Syrians, saying, Go and see. 

{7:15} Andthey went after them unto Jordan: and, lo, all the way [was] full ofgarments and vessels, which the Syrians had cast away in their haste.And the messengers returned, and told the king. 

{7:16} And the peoplewent out, and spoiled the tents of the Syrians. So a measure of fineflour was [sold] for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel,according to the word of the LORD.   

{7:17} And the king appointed the lord on whose hand he leaned tohave the charge of the gate: and the people trode upon him in the gate,and he died, as the man of God had said, who spake when the king camedown to him. 

{7:18} And it came to pass as the man of God had spoken tothe king, saying, Two measures of barley for a shekel, and a measure offine flour for a shekel, shall be to morrow about this time in the gateof Samaria: 

{7:19} And that lord answered the man of God, and said,Now, behold, [if] the LORD should make windows in heaven, might such athing be? And he said, Behold, thou shalt see it with thine eyes, butshalt not eat thereof. 

{7:20} And so it fell out unto him: for thepeople trode upon him in the gate, and he died.   

{8:1} Then spake Elisha unto the woman, whose son he had restored tolife, saying, Arise, and go thou and thine household, and sojournwheresoever thou canst sojourn: for the LORD hath called for a famine;and it shall also come upon the land seven years. 

{8:2} And the womanarose, and did after the saying of the man of God: and she went withher household, and sojourned in the land of the Philistines sevenyears. 

{8:3} And it came to pass at the seven years' end, that thewoman returned out of the land of the Philistines: and she went forthto cry unto the king for her house and for her land. 

{8:4} And the kingtalked with Gehazi the servant of the man of God, saying, Tell me, Ipray thee, all the great things that Elisha hath done. 

{8:5} And itcame to pass, as he was telling the king how he had restored a deadbody to life, that, behold, the woman, whose son he had restored tolife, cried to the king for her house and for her land. And Gehazisaid, My lord, O king, this [is] the woman, and this [is] her son, whomElisha restored to life. 

{8:6} And when the king asked the woman, shetold him. So the king appointed unto her a certain officer, saying,Restore all that [was] hers, and all the fruits of the field since theday that she left the land, even until now.   

{8:7} And Elisha came to Damascus; and Ben-hadad the king of Syriawas sick; and it was told him, saying, The man of God is come hither.

{8:8} And the king said unto Hazael, Take a present in thine hand, andgo, meet the man of God, and enquire of the LORD by him, saying, ShallI recover of this disease? 

{8:9} So Hazael went to meet him, and took apresent with him, even of every good thing of Damascus, forty camels'burden, and came and stood before him, and said, Thy son Ben-hadad kingof Syria hath sent me to thee, saying, Shall I recover of this disease?

{8:10} And Elisha said unto him, Go, say unto him, Thou mayestcertainly recover: howbeit the LORD hath shewed me that he shall surelydie. 

{8:11} And he settled his countenance stedfastly, until he wasashamed: and the man of God wept. 

{8:12} And Hazael said, Why weepethmy lord? And he answered, Because I know the evil that thou wilt dounto the children of Israel: their strong holds wilt thou set on fire,and their young men wilt thou slay with the sword, and wilt dash theirchildren, and rip up their women with child. 

{8:13} And Hazael said,But what, [is] thy servant a dog, that he should do this great thing?And Elisha answered, The LORD hath shewed me that thou [shalt be] kingover Syria. 

{8:14} So he departed from Elisha, and came to his master;who said to him, What said Elisha to thee? And he answered, He told me[that ]thou shouldest surely recover. 

{8:15} And it came to pass on themorrow, that he took a thick cloth, and dipped [it] in water, andspread [it] on his face, so that he died: and Hazael reigned in hisstead.   

{8:16} And in the fifth year of Joram the son of Ahab king ofIsrael, Jehoshaphat [being] then king of Judah, Jehoram the son ofJehoshaphat king of Judah began to reign. 

{8:17} Thirty and two yearsold was he when he began to reign; and he reigned eight years inJerusalem. 

{8:18} And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, asdid the house of Ahab: for the daughter of Ahab was his wife: and hedid evil in the sight of the LORD. 

{8:19} Yet the LORD would notdestroy Judah for David his servant's sake, as he promised him to givehim alway a light, [and] to his children.   

{8:20} In his days Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah, andmade a king over themselves. 

{8:21} So Joram went over to Zair, and allthe chariots with him: and he rose by night, and smote the Edomiteswhich compassed him about, and the captains of the chariots: and thepeople fled into their tents. 

{8:22} Yet Edom revolted from under thehand of Judah unto this day. Then Libnah revolted at the same time.

{8:23} And the rest of the acts of Joram, and all that he did, [are]they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?

{8:24} And Joram slept with his fathers, and was buried with hisfathers in the city of David: and Ahaziah his son reigned in his stead.   

{8:25} In the twelfth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israeldid Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah begin to reign. 

{8:26} Twoand twenty years old [was] Ahaziah when he began to reign; and hereigned one year in Jerusalem. And his mother's name [was] Athaliah,the daughter of Omri king of Israel. 

{8:27} And he walked in the way ofthe house of Ahab, and did evil in the sight of the LORD, as [did] thehouse of Ahab: for he [was] the son in law of the house of Ahab.   

{8:28} And he went with Joram the son of Ahab to the war againstHazael king of Syria in Ramoth-gilead; and the Syrians wounded Joram.

{8:29} And king Joram went back to be healed in Jezreel of the woundswhich the Syrians had given him at Ramah, when he fought against Hazaelking of Syria. And Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah went downto see Joram the son of Ahab in Jezreel, because he was sick.   

{9:1} And Elisha the prophet called one of the children of theprophets, and said unto him, Gird up thy loins, and take this box ofoil in thine hand, and go to Ramoth-gilead: 

{9:2} And when thou comestthither, look out there Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi,and go in, and make him arise up from among his brethren, and carry himto an inner chamber; 

{9:3} Then take the box of oil, and pour [it] onhis head, and say, Thus saith the LORD, I have anointed thee king overIsrael. Then open the door, and flee, and tarry not.   

{9:4} So the young man, [even] the young man the prophet, went toRamoth-gilead. 

{9:5} And when he came, behold, the captains of the host[were] sitting; and he said, I have an errand to thee, O captain. AndJehu said, Unto which of all us? And he said, To thee, O captain. 

{9:6}And he arose, and went into the house; and he poured the oil on hishead, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, I haveanointed thee king over the people of the LORD, [even] over Israel.

{9:7} And thou shalt smite the house of Ahab thy master, that I mayavenge the blood of my servants the prophets, and the blood of all theservants of the LORD, at the hand of Jezebel. 

{9:8} For the whole houseof Ahab shall perish: and I will cut off from Ahab him that pissethagainst the wall, and him that is shut up and left in Israel: 

{9:9} AndI will make the house of Ahab like the house of Jeroboam the son ofNebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah: 

{9:10} And thedogs shall eat Jezebel in the portion of Jezreel, and [there shall be]none to bury [her.] And he opened the door, and fled.   

{9:11} Then Jehu came forth to the servants of his lord: and [one]said unto him, [Is] all well? wherefore came this mad [fellow] to thee?And he said unto them, Ye know the man, and his communication. 

{9:12}And they said, [It is] false; tell us now. And he said, Thus and thusspake he to me, saying, Thus saith the LORD, I have anointed thee kingover Israel. 

{9:13} Then they hasted, and took every man his garment,and put [it] under him on the top of the stairs, and blew withtrumpets, saying, Jehu is king. 

{9:14} So Jehu the son of Jehoshaphatthe son of Nimshi conspired against Joram. (Now Joram had keptRamoth-gilead, he and all Israel, because of Hazael king of Syria.

{9:15} But king Joram was returned to be healed in Jezreel of thewounds which the Syrians had given him, when he fought with Hazael kingof Syria.) And Jehu said, If it be your minds, [then] let none go forth[nor] escape out of the city to go to tell [it] in Jezreel. 

{9:16} SoJehu rode in a chariot, and went to Jezreel; for Joram lay there. AndAhaziah king of Judah was come down to see Joram. 

{9:17} And therestood a watchman on the tower in Jezreel, and he spied the company ofJehu as he came, and said, I see a company. And Joram said, Take anhorseman, and send to meet them, and let him say, [Is it] peace? 

{9:18}So there went one on horseback to meet him, and said, Thus saith theking, [Is it] peace? And Jehu said, What hast thou to do with peace?turn thee behind me. And the watchman told, saying, The messenger cameto them, but he cometh not again. 

{9:19} Then he sent out a second onhorseback, which came to them, and said, Thus saith the king, [Is it]peace? And Jehu answered, What hast thou to do with peace? turn theebehind me. 

{9:20} And the watchman told, saying, He came even untothem, and cometh not again: and the driving is like the driving of Jehuthe son of Nimshi; for he driveth furiously. 

{9:21} And Joram said,Make ready. And his chariot was made ready. And Joram king of Israeland Ahaziah king of Judah went out, each in his chariot, and they wentout against Jehu, and met him in the portion of Naboth the Jezreelite.

{9:22} And it came to pass, when Joram saw Jehu, that he said, [Is it]peace, Jehu? And he answered, What peace, so long as the whoredoms ofthy mother Jezebel and her witchcrafts [are so] many? 

{9:23} And Joramturned his hands, and fled, and said to Ahaziah, [There is] treachery,O Ahaziah. 

{9:24} And Jehu drew a bow with his full strength, and smoteJehoram between his arms, and the arrow went out at his heart, and hesunk down in his chariot. 

{9:25} Then said [Jehu] to Bidkar hiscaptain, Take up, [and] cast him in the portion of the field of Naboththe Jezreelite: for remember how that, when I and thou rode togetherafter Ahab his father, the LORD laid this burden upon him; 

{9:26}Surely I have seen yesterday the blood of Naboth, and the blood of hissons, saith the LORD; and I will requite thee in this plat, saith theLORD. Now therefore take [and] cast him into the plat [of ground,]according to the word of the LORD.   

{9:27} But when Ahaziah the king of Judah saw [this,] he fled by theway of the garden house. And Jehu followed after him, and said, Smitehim also in the chariot. [And they did so] at the going up to Gur,which [is] by Ibleam. And he fled to Megiddo, and died there. 

{9:28}And his servants carried him in a chariot to Jerusalem, and buried himin his sepulchre with his fathers in the city of David. 

{9:29} And inthe eleventh year of Joram the son of Ahab began Ahaziah to reign overJudah.   

{9:30} And when Jehu was come to Jezreel, Jezebel heard [of it;] andshe painted her face, and tired her head, and looked out at a window.

{9:31} And as Jehu entered in at the gate, she said, [Had] Zimri peace,who slew his master? 

{9:32} And he lifted up his face to the window,and said, Who [is] on my side? who? And there looked out to him two[or] three eunuchs. 

{9:33} And he said, Throw her down. So they threwher down: and [some] of her blood was sprinkled on the wall, and on thehorses: and he trode her under foot. 

{9:34} And when he was come in, hedid eat and drink, and said, Go, see now this cursed [woman,] and buryher: for she [is] a king's daughter. 

{9:35} And they went to bury her:but they found no more of her than the skull, and the feet, and thepalms of [her] hands. 

{9:36} Wherefore they came again, and told him.And he said, This [is] the word of the LORD, which he spake by hisservant Elijah the Tishbite, saying, In the portion of Jezreel shalldogs eat the flesh of Jezebel: 

{9:37} And the carcase of Jezebel shallbe as dung upon the face of the field in the portion of Jezreel; [so]that they shall not say, This [is] Jezebel.   

{10:1} And Ahab had seventy sons in Samaria. And Jehu wrote letters,and sent to Samaria, unto the rulers of Jezreel, to the elders, and tothem that brought up Ahab's [children,] saying, 

{10:2} Now as soon asthis letter cometh to you, seeing your master's sons [are] with you,and [there are] with you chariots and horses, a fenced city also, andarmour; 

{10:3} Look even out the best and meetest of your master'ssons, and set [him] on his father's throne, and fight for your master'shouse. 

{10:4} But they were exceedingly afraid, and said, Behold, twokings stood not before him: how then shall we stand? 

{10:5} And he that[was] over the house, and he that [was] over the city, the elders also,and the bringers up [of the children,] sent to Jehu, saying, We are thyservants, and will do all that thou shalt bid us; we will not make anyking: do thou [that which is] good in thine eyes. 

{10:6} Then he wrotea letter the second time to them, saying, If ye [be] mine, and [if] yewill hearken unto my voice, take ye the heads of the men your master'ssons, and come to me to Jezreel by to morrow this time. Now the king'ssons, [being] seventy persons, [were] with the great men of the city,which brought them up. 

{10:7} And it came to pass, when the letter cameto them, that they took the king's sons, and slew seventy persons, andput their heads in baskets, and sent him [them] to Jezreel.   

{10:8} And there came a messenger, and told him, saying, They havebrought the heads of the king's sons. And he said, Lay ye them in twoheaps at the entering in of the gate until the morning. 

{10:9} And itcame to pass in the morning, that he went out, and stood, and said toall the people, Ye [be] righteous: behold, I conspired against mymaster, and slew him: but who slew all these? 

{10:10} Know now thatthere shall fall unto the earth nothing of the word of the LORD, whichthe LORD spake concerning the house of Ahab: for the LORD hath done[that] which he spake by his servant Elijah. 

{10:11} So Jehu slew allthat remained of the house of Ahab in Jezreel, and all his great men,and his kinsfolks, and his priests, until he left him none remaining.   

{10:12} And he arose and departed, and came to Samaria. [And] as he[was] at the shearing house in the way, 

{10:13} Jehu met with thebrethren of Ahaziah king of Judah, and said, Who [are] ye? And theyanswered, We [are] the brethren of Ahaziah; and we go down to salutethe children of the king and the children of the queen. 

{10:14} And hesaid, Take them alive. And they took them alive, and slew them at thepit of the shearing house, [even] two and forty men; neither left heany of them.   

{10:15} And when he was departed thence, he lighted on Jehonadab theson of Rechab [coming] to meet him: and he saluted him, and said tohim, Is thine heart right, as my heart [is] with thy heart? AndJehonadab answered, It is. If it be, give [me] thine hand. And he gave[him] his hand; and he took him up to him into the chariot. 

{10:16} Andhe said, Come with me, and see my zeal for the LORD. So they made himride in his chariot. 

{10:17} And when he came to Samaria, he slew allthat remained unto Ahab in Samaria, till he had destroyed him,according to the saying of the LORD, which he spake to Elijah.   

{10:18} And Jehu gathered all the people together, and said untothem, Ahab served Baal a little; [but] Jehu shall serve him much.

{10:19} Now therefore call unto me all the prophets of Baal, all hisservants, and all his priests; let none be wanting: for I have a greatsacrifice [to do] to Baal; whosoever shall be wanting, he shall notlive. But Jehu did [it] in subtilty, to the intent that he mightdestroy the worshippers of Baal. 

{10:20} And Jehu said, Proclaim asolemn assembly for Baal. And they proclaimed [it. ]

{10:21} And Jehusent through all Israel: and all the worshippers of Baal came, so thatthere was not a man left that came not. And they came into the house ofBaal; and the house of Baal was full from one end to another. 

{10:22}And he said unto him that [was] over the vestry, Bring forth vestmentsfor all the worshippers of Baal. And he brought them forth vestments.

{10:23} And Jehu went, and Jehonadab the son of Rechab, into the houseof Baal, and said unto the worshippers of Baal, Search, and look thatthere be here with you none of the servants of the LORD, but theworshippers of Baal only. 

{10:24} And when they went in to offersacrifices and burnt offerings, Jehu appointed fourscore men without,and said, [If] any of the men whom I have brought into your handsescape, [he that letteth him go,] his life [shall be] for the life ofhim. 

{10:25} And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end ofoffering the burnt offering, that Jehu said to the guard and to thecaptains, Go in, [and] slay them; let none come forth. And they smotethem with the edge of the sword; and the guard and the captains cast[them] out, and went to the city of the house of Baal. 

{10:26} And theybrought forth the images out of the house of Baal, and burned them.

{10:27} And they brake down the image of Baal, and brake down the houseof Baal, and made it a draught house unto this day. 

{10:28} Thus Jehudestroyed Baal out of Israel.   

{10:29} Howbeit [from] the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, whomade Israel to sin, Jehu departed not from after them, [to wit,] thegolden calves that [were] in Bethel, and that [were] in Dan. 

{10:30}And the LORD said unto Jehu, Because thou hast done well in executing[that which is] right in mine eyes, [and] hast done unto the house ofAhab according to all that [was] in mine heart, thy children of thefourth [generation] shall sit on the throne of Israel. 

{10:31} But Jehutook no heed to walk in the law of the LORD God of Israel with all hisheart: for he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam, which made Israelto sin.   

{10:32} In those days the LORD began to cut Israel short: and Hazaelsmote them in all the coasts of Israel; 

{10:33} From Jordan eastward,all the land of Gilead, the Gadites, and the Reubenites, and theManassites, from Aroer, which is by the river Arnon, even Gilead andBashan. 

{10:34} Now the rest of the acts of Jehu, and all that he did,and all his might, [are] they not written in the book of the chroniclesof the kings of Israel? 

{10:35} And Jehu slept with his fathers: andthey buried him in Samaria. And Jehoahaz his son reigned in his stead.

{10:36} And the time that Jehu reigned over Israel in Samaria [was]twenty and eight years.   

{11:1} And when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son wasdead, she arose and destroyed all the seed royal. 

{11:2} But Jehosheba,the daughter of king Joram, sister of Ahaziah, took Joash the son ofAhaziah and stole him from among the king's sons [which were] slain;and they hid him, [even] him and his nurse, in the bedchamber fromAthaliah, so that he was not slain. 

{11:3} And he was with her hid inthe house of the LORD six years. And Athaliah did reign over the land.   

{11:4} And the seventh year Jehoiada sent and fetched the rulersover hundreds, with the captains and the guard, and brought them to himinto the house of the LORD, and made a covenant with them, and took anoath of them in the house of the LORD, and shewed them the king's son.

{11:5} And he commanded them, saying, This is the thing that ye shalldo; A third part of you that enter in on the sabbath shall even bekeepers of the watch of the king's house; 

{11:6} And a third part[shall be] at the gate of Sur; and a third part at the gate behind theguard: so shall ye keep the watch of the house, that it be not brokendown. 

{11:7} And two parts of all you that go forth on the sabbath,even they shall keep the watch of the house of the LORD about the king.

{11:8} And ye shall compass the king round about, every man with hisweapons in his hand: and he that cometh within the ranges, let him beslain: and be ye with the king as he goeth out and as he cometh in.

{11:9} And the captains over the hundreds did according to all [things]that Jehoiada the priest commanded: and they took every man his menthat were to come in on the sabbath, with them that should go out onthe sabbath, and came to Jehoiada the priest. 

{11:10} And to thecaptains over hundreds did the priest give king David's spears andshields, that [were] in the temple of the LORD. 

{11:11} And the guardstood, every man with his weapons in his hand, round about the king,from the right corner of the temple to the left corner of the temple,[along] by the altar and the temple. 

{11:12} And he brought forth theking's son, and put the crown upon him, and [gave him] the testimony;and they made him king, and anointed him; and they clapped their hands,and said, God save the king.   

{11:13} And when Athaliah heard the noise of the guard [and] of thepeople, she came to the people into the temple of the LORD. 

{11:14} Andwhen she looked, behold, the king stood by a pillar, as the manner[was,] and the princes and the trumpeters by the king, and all thepeople of the land rejoiced, and blew with trumpets: and Athaliah renther clothes, and cried, Treason, Treason. 

{11:15} But Jehoiada thepriest commanded the captains of the hundreds, the officers of thehost, and said unto them, Have her forth without the ranges: and himthat followeth her kill with the sword. For the priest had said, Lether not be slain in the house of the LORD. 

{11:16} And they laid handson her; and she went by the way by the which the horses came into theking's house: and there was she slain.   

{11:17} And Jehoiada made a covenant between the LORD and the kingand the people that they should be the LORD'S people; between the kingalso and the people. 

{11:18} And all the people of the land went intothe house of Baal, and brake it down; his altars and his images brakethey in pieces thoroughly, and slew Mattan the priest of Baal beforethe altars. And the priest appointed officers over the house of theLORD. 

{11:19} And he took the rulers over hundreds, and the captains,and the guard, and all the people of the land; and they brought downthe king from the house of the LORD, and came by the way of the gate ofthe guard to the king's house. And he sat on the throne of the kings.

{11:20} And all the people of the land rejoiced, and the city was inquiet: and they slew Athaliah with the sword [beside] the king's house.

{11:21} Seven years old [was] Jehoash when he began to reign.   

{12:1} In the seventh year of Jehu Jehoash began to reign; and fortyyears reigned he in Jerusalem. And his mother's name [was] Zibiah ofBeer-sheba. 

{12:2} And Jehoash did [that which was] right in the sightof the LORD all his days wherein Jehoiada the priest instructed him.

{12:3} But the high places were not taken away: the people stillsacrificed and burnt incense in the high places.   

{12:4} And Jehoash said to the priests, All the money of thededicated things that is brought into the house of the LORD, [even] themoney of every one that passeth [the account,] the money that every manis set at, [and] all the money that cometh into any man's heart tobring into the house of the LORD, 

{12:5} Let the priests take [it] tothem, every man of his acquaintance: and let them repair the breachesof the house, wheresoever any breach shall be found. 

{12:6} But it was[so, that] in the three and twentieth year of king Jehoash the priestshad not repaired the breaches of the house. 

{12:7} Then king Jehoashcalled for Jehoiada the priest, and the [other] priests, and said untothem, Why repair ye not the breaches of the house? now thereforereceive no [more] money of your acquaintance, but deliver it for thebreaches of the house. 

{12:8} And the priests consented to receive no[more] money of the people, neither to repair the breaches of thehouse. 

{12:9} But Jehoiada the priest took a chest, and bored a hole inthe lid of it, and set it beside the altar, on the right side as onecometh into the house of the LORD: and the priests that kept the doorput therein all the money [that was] brought into the house of theLORD. 

{12:10} And it was [so,] when they saw that [there was] muchmoney in the chest, that the king's scribe and the high priest came up,and they put up in bags, and told the money that was found in the houseof the LORD. 

{12:11} And they gave the money, being told, into thehands of them that did the work, that had the oversight of the house ofthe LORD: and they laid it out to the carpenters and builders, thatwrought upon the house of the LORD, 

{12:12} And to masons, and hewersof stone, and to buy timber and hewed stone to repair the breaches ofthe house of the LORD, and for all that was laid out for the house torepair [it. ]

{12:13} Howbeit there were not made for the house of theLORD bowls of silver, snuffers, basons, trumpets, any vessels of gold,or vessels of silver, of the money [that was] brought into the house ofthe LORD: 

{12:14} But they gave that to the workmen, and repairedtherewith the house of the LORD. 

{12:15} Moreover they reckoned notwith the men, into whose hand they delivered the money to be bestowedon workmen: for they dealt faithfully. 

{12:16} The trespass money andsin money was not brought into the house of the LORD: it was thepriests'.   

{12:17} Then Hazael king of Syria went up, and fought against Gath,and took it: and Hazael set his face to go up to Jerusalem. 

{12:18} AndJehoash king of Judah took all the hallowed things that Jehoshaphat,and Jehoram, and Ahaziah, his fathers, kings of Judah, had dedicated,and his own hallowed things, and all the gold [that was] found in thetreasures of the house of the LORD, and in the king's house, and sent[it] to Hazael king of Syria: and he went away from Jerusalem.   

{12:19} And the rest of the acts of Joash, and all that he did,[are] they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings ofJudah? 

{12:20} And his servants arose, and made a conspiracy, and slewJoash in the house of Millo, which goeth down to Silla. 

{12:21} ForJozachar the son of Shimeath, and Jehozabad the son of Shomer, hisservants, smote him, and he died; and they buried him with his fathersin the city of David: and Amaziah his son reigned in his stead.   

{13:1} In the three and twentieth year of Joash the son of Ahaziahking of Judah Jehoahaz the son of Jehu began to reign over Israel inSamaria, [and reigned] seventeen years. 

{13:2} And he did [that whichwas] evil in the sight of the LORD, and followed the sins of Jeroboamthe son of Nebat, which made Israel to sin; he departed not therefrom.   

{13:3} And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel, and hedelivered them into the hand of Hazael king of Syria, and into the handof Ben-hadad the son of Hazael, all [their] days. 

{13:4} And Jehoahazbesought the LORD, and the LORD hearkened unto him: for he saw theoppression of Israel, because the king of Syria oppressed them. 

{13:5}(And the LORD gave Israel a saviour, so that they went out from underthe hand of the Syrians: and the children of Israel dwelt in theirtents, as beforetime. 

{13:6} Nevertheless they departed not from thesins of the house of Jeroboam, who made Israel sin, [but] walkedtherein: and there remained the grove also in Samaria.) 

{13:7} Neitherdid he leave of the people to Jehoahaz but fifty horsemen, and tenchariots, and ten thousand footmen; for the king of Syria had destroyedthem, and had made them like the dust by threshing.   

{13:8} Now the rest of the acts of Jehoahaz, and all that he did,and his might, [are] they not written in the book of the chronicles ofthe kings of Israel? 

{13:9} And Jehoahaz slept with his fathers; andthey buried him in Samaria: and Joash his son reigned in his stead.   

{13:10} In the thirty and seventh year of Joash king of Judah beganJehoash the son of Jehoahaz to reign over Israel in Samaria, [andreigned] sixteen years. 

{13:11} And he did [that which was] evil in thesight of the LORD; he departed not from all the sins of Jeroboam theson of Nebat, who made Israel sin: [but] he walked therein. 

{13:12} Andthe rest of the acts of Joash, and all that he did, and his mightwherewith he fought against Amaziah king of Judah, [are] they notwritten in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? 

{13:13}And Joash slept with his fathers; and Jeroboam sat upon his throne: andJoash was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel.   

{13:14} Now Elisha was fallen sick of his sickness whereof he died.And Joash the king of Israel came down unto him, and wept over hisface, and said, O my father, my father, the chariot of Israel, and thehorsemen thereof. 

{13:15} And Elisha said unto him, Take bow andarrows. And he took unto him bow and arrows. 

{13:16} And he said to theking of Israel, Put thine hand upon the bow. And he put his hand [uponit:] and Elisha put his hands upon the king's hands. 

{13:17} And hesaid, Open the window eastward. And he opened [it.] Then Elisha said,Shoot. And he shot. And he said, The arrow of the LORD'S deliverance,and the arrow of deliverance from Syria: for thou shalt smite theSyrians in Aphek, till thou have consumed [them. ]

{13:18} And he said,Take the arrows. And he took [them.] And he said unto the king ofIsrael, Smite upon the ground. And he smote thrice, and stayed. 

{13:19}And the man of God was wroth with him, and said, Thou shouldest havesmitten five or six times; then hadst thou smitten Syria till thouhadst consumed [it:] whereas now thou shalt smite Syria [but] thrice.   

{13:20} And Elisha died, and they buried him. And the bands of theMoabites invaded the land at the coming in of the year. 

{13:21} And itcame to pass, as they were burying a man, that, behold, they spied aband [of men;] and they cast the man into the sepulchre of Elisha: andwhen the man was let down, and touched the bones of Elisha, he revived,and stood up on his feet.   

{13:22} But Hazael king of Syria oppressed Israel all the days ofJehoahaz. 

{13:23} And the LORD was gracious unto them, and hadcompassion on them, and had respect unto them, because of his covenantwith Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and would not destroy them, neithercast he them from his presence as yet. 

{13:24} So Hazael king of Syriadied; and Ben- hadad his son reigned in his stead. 

{13:25} And Jehoashthe son of Jehoahaz took again out of the hand of Ben-hadad the son ofHazael the cities, which he had taken out of the hand of Jehoahaz hisfather by war. Three times did Joash beat him, and recovered the citiesof Israel.   

{14:1} In the second year of Joash son of Jehoahaz king of Israelreigned Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah. 

{14:2} He was twentyand five years old when he began to reign, and reigned twenty and nineyears in Jerusalem. And his mother's name [was] Jehoaddan of Jerusalem.

{14:3} And he did [that which was] right in the sight of the LORD, yetnot like David his father: he did according to all things as Joash hisfather did. 

{14:4} Howbeit the high places were not taken away: as yetthe people did sacrifice and burnt incense on the high places.   

{14:5} And it came to pass, as soon as the kingdom was confirmed inhis hand, that he slew his servants which had slain the king hisfather. 

{14:6} But the children of the murderers he slew not: accordingunto that which is written in the book of the law of Moses, wherein theLORD commanded, saying, The fathers shall not be put to death for thechildren, nor the children be put to death for the fathers; but everyman shall be put to death for his own sin. 

{14:7} He slew of Edom inthe valley of salt ten thousand, and took Selah by war, and called thename of it Joktheel unto this day.   

{14:8} Then Amaziah sent messengers to Jehoash, the son of Jehoahazson of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, Come, let us look one another inthe face. 

{14:9} And Jehoash the king of Israel sent to Amaziah king ofJudah, saying, The thistle that [was] in Lebanon sent to the cedar that[was] in Lebanon, saying, Give thy daughter to my son to wife: andthere passed by a wild beast that [was] in Lebanon, and trode down thethistle. 

{14:10} Thou hast indeed smitten Edom, and thine heart hathlifted thee up: glory [of this,] and tarry at home: for why shouldestthou meddle to [thy] hurt, that thou shouldest fall, [even] thou, andJudah with thee? 

{14:11} But Amaziah would not hear. Therefore Jehoashking of Israel went up; and he and Amaziah king of Judah looked oneanother in the face at Beth-shemesh, which [belongeth] to Judah.

{14:12} And Judah was put to the worse before Israel; and they fledevery man to their tents. 

{14:13} And Jehoash king of Israel tookAmaziah king of Judah, the son of Jehoash the son of Ahaziah, at Beth-shemesh, and came to Jerusalem, and brake down the wall of Jerusalemfrom the gate of Ephraim unto the corner gate, four hundred cubits.

{14:14} And he took all the gold and silver, and all the vessels thatwere found in the house of the LORD, and in the treasures of the king'shouse, and hostages, and returned to Samaria.   

{14:15} Now the rest of the acts of Jehoash which he did, and hismight, and how he fought with Amaziah king of Judah, [are] they notwritten in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? 

{14:16}And Jehoash slept with his fathers, and was buried in Samaria with thekings of Israel; and Jeroboam his son reigned in his stead.   

{14:17} And Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah lived after thedeath of Jehoash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel fifteen years. 

{14:18}And the rest of the acts of Amaziah, [are] they not written in the bookof the chronicles of the kings of Judah? 

{14:19} Now they made aconspiracy against him in Jerusalem: and he fled to Lachish; but theysent after him to Lachish, and slew him there. 

{14:20} And they broughthim on horses: and he was buried at Jerusalem with his fathers in thecity of David.   

{14:21} And all the people of Judah took Azariah, which [was]sixteen years old, and made him king instead of his father Amaziah.

{14:22} He built Elath, and restored it to Judah, after that the kingslept with his fathers.   

{14:23} In the fifteenth year of Amaziah the son of Joash king ofJudah Jeroboam the son of Joash king of Israel began to reign inSamaria, [and reigned] forty and one years. 

{14:24} And he did [thatwhich was] evil in the sight of the LORD: he departed not from all thesins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin. 

{14:25} Herestored the coast of Israel from the entering of Hamath unto the seaof the plain, according to the word of the LORD God of Israel, which hespake by the hand of his servant Jonah, the son of Amittai, theprophet, which [was] of Gath-hepher. 

{14:26} For the LORD saw theaffliction of Israel, [that it was] very bitter: for [there was] notany shut up, nor any left, nor any helper for Israel. 

{14:27} And theLORD said not that he would blot out the name of Israel from underheaven: but he saved them by the hand of Jeroboam the son of Joash.   

{14:28} Now the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, and all that he did,and his might, how he warred, and how he recovered Damascus, andHamath, [which belonged] to Judah, for Israel, are they not written inthe book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? 

{14:29} And Jeroboamslept with his fathers, [even] with the kings of Israel; and Zachariahhis son reigned in his stead.   

{15:1} In the twenty and seventh year of Jeroboam king of Israelbegan Azariah son of Amaziah king of Judah to reign. 

{15:2} Sixteenyears old was he when he began to reign, and he reigned two and fiftyyears in Jerusalem. And his mother's name [was] Jecholiah of Jerusalem.

{15:3} And he did [that which was] right in the sight of the LORD,according to all that his father Amaziah had done; 

{15:4} Save that thehigh places were not removed: the people sacrificed and burnt incensestill on the high places.   

{15:5} And the LORD smote the king, so that he was a leper unto theday of his death, and dwelt in a several house. And Jotham the king'sson [was] over the house, judging the people of the land. 

{15:6} Andthe rest of the acts of Azariah, and all that he did, [are] they notwritten in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? 

{15:7} SoAzariah slept with his fathers; and they buried him with his fathers inthe city of David: and Jotham his son reigned in his stead.   

{15:8} In the thirty and eighth year of Azariah king of Judah didZachariah the son of Jeroboam reign over Israel in Samaria six months.

{15:9} And he did [that which was] evil in the sight of the LORD, ashis fathers had done: he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam the sonof Nebat, who made Israel to sin. 

{15:10} And Shallum the son of Jabeshconspired against him, and smote him before the people, and slew him,and reigned in his stead. 

{15:11} And the rest of the acts ofZachariah, behold, they [are] written in the book of the chronicles ofthe kings of Israel. 

{15:12} This [was] the word of the LORD which hespake unto Jehu, saying, Thy sons shall sit on the throne of Israelunto the fourth [generation.] And so it came to pass.   

{15:13} Shallum the son of Jabesh began to reign in the nine andthirtieth year of Uzziah king of Judah; and he reigned a full month inSamaria. 

{15:14} For Menahem the son of Gadi went up from Tirzah, andcame to Samaria, and smote Shallum the son of Jabesh in Samaria, andslew him, and reigned in his stead. 

{15:15} And the rest of the acts ofShallum, and his conspiracy which he made, behold, they [are] writtenin the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.   

{15:16} Then Menahem smote Tiphsah, and all that [were] therein, andthe coasts thereof from Tirzah: because they opened not [to him,]therefore he smote [it; and] all the women therein that were with childhe ripped up. 

{15:17} In the nine and thirtieth year of Azariah king ofJudah began Menahem the son of Gadi to reign over Israel, [and reigned]ten years in Samaria. 

{15:18} And he did [that which was] evil in thesight of the LORD: he departed not all his days from the sins ofJeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin. 

{15:19} [And] Pulthe king of Assyria came against the land: and Menahem gave Pul athousand talents of silver, that his hand might be with him to confirmthe kingdom in his hand. 

{15:20} And Menahem exacted the money ofIsrael, [even] of all the mighty men of wealth, of each man fiftyshekels of silver, to give to the king of Assyria. So the king ofAssyria turned back, and stayed not there in the land.   

{15:21} And the rest of the acts of Menahem, and all that he did,[are] they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings ofIsrael? 

{15:22} And Menahem slept with his fathers; and Pekahiah hisson reigned in his stead.   

{15:23} In the fiftieth year of Azariah king of Judah Pekahiah theson of Menahem began to reign over Israel in Samaria, [and reigned] twoyears. 

{15:24} And he did [that which was] evil in the sight of theLORD: he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, whomade Israel to sin. 

{15:25} But Pekah the son of Remaliah, a captain ofhis, conspired against him, and smote him in Samaria, in the palace ofthe king's house, with Argob and Arieh, and with him fifty men of theGileadites: and he killed him, and reigned in his room. 

{15:26} And therest of the acts of Pekahiah, and all that he did, behold, they [are]written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.   

{15:27} In the two and fiftieth year of Azariah king of Judah Pekahthe son of Remaliah began to reign over Israel in Samaria, [andreigned] twenty years. 

{15:28} And he did [that which was] evil in thesight of the LORD: he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam the son ofNebat, who made Israel to sin. 

{15:29} In the days of Pekah king ofIsrael came Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria, and took Ijon, andAbel-beth-maachah, and Janoah, and Kedesh, and Hazor, and Gilead, andGalilee, all the land of Naphtali, and carried them captive to Assyria.

{15:30} And Hoshea the son of Elah made a conspiracy against Pekah theson of Remaliah, and smote him, and slew him, and reigned in his stead,in the twentieth year of Jotham the son of Uzziah. 

{15:31} And the restof the acts of Pekah, and all that he did, behold, they [are] writtenin the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.   

{15:32} In the second year of Pekah the son of Remaliah king ofIsrael began Jotham the son of Uzziah king of Judah to reign. 

{15:33}Five and twenty years old was he when he began to reign, and he reignedsixteen years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name [was] Jerusha, thedaughter of Zadok. 

{15:34} And he did [that which was] right in thesight of the LORD: he did according to all that his father Uzziah haddone.   

{15:35} Howbeit the high places were not removed: the peoplesacrificed and burned incense still in the high places. He built thehigher gate of the house of the LORD.   

{15:36} Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all that he did,[are] they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings ofJudah? 

{15:37} In those days the LORD began to send against Judah Rezinthe king of Syria, and Pekah the son of Remaliah. 

{15:38} And Jothamslept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city ofDavid his father: and Ahaz his son reigned in his stead.   

{16:1} In the seventeenth year of Pekah the son of Remaliah Ahaz theson of Jotham king of Judah began to reign. 

{16:2} Twenty years old[was] Ahaz when he began to reign, and reigned sixteen years inJerusalem, and did not [that which was] right in the sight of the LORDhis God, like David his father. 

{16:3} But he walked in the way of thekings of Israel, yea, and made his son to pass through the fire,according to the abominations of the heathen, whom the LORD cast outfrom before the children of Israel. 

{16:4} And he sacrificed and burntincense in the high places, and on the hills, and under every greentree.   

{16:5} Then Rezin king of Syria and Pekah son of Remaliah king ofIsrael came up to Jerusalem to war: and they besieged Ahaz, but couldnot overcome [him. ]

{16:6} At that time Rezin king of Syria recoveredElath to Syria, and drave the Jews from Elath: and the Syrians came toElath, and dwelt there unto this day. 

{16:7} So Ahaz sent messengers toTiglath-pileser king of Assyria, saying, I [am] thy servant and thyson: come up, and save me out of the hand of the king of Syria, and outof the hand of the king of Israel, which rise up against me. 

{16:8} AndAhaz took the silver and gold that was found in the house of the LORD,and in the treasures of the king's house, and sent [it for] a presentto the king of Assyria. 

{16:9} And the king of Assyria hearkened untohim: for the king of Assyria went up against Damascus, and took it, andcarried [the people of] it captive to Kir, and slew Rezin.   

{16:10} And king Ahaz went to Damascus to meet Tiglath-pileser kingof Assyria, and saw an altar that [was] at Damascus: and king Ahaz sentto Urijah the priest the fashion of the altar, and the pattern of it,according to all the workmanship thereof. 

{16:11} And Urijah the priestbuilt an altar according to all that king Ahaz had sent from Damascus:so Urijah the priest made [it] against king Ahaz came from Damascus.

{16:12} And when the king was come from Damascus, the king saw thealtar: and the king approached to the altar, and offered thereon.

{16:13} and he burnt his burnt offering and his meat offering, andpoured his drink offering, and sprinkled the blood of his peaceofferings, upon the altar. 

{16:14} And he brought also the brasenaltar, which [was] before the LORD, from the forefront of the house,from between the altar and the house of the LORD, and put it on thenorth side of the altar. 

{16:15} And king Ahaz commanded Urijah thepriest, saying, Upon the great altar burn the morning burnt offering,and the evening meat offering, and the king's burnt sacrifice, and hismeat offering, with the burnt offering of all the people of the land,and their meat offering, and their drink offerings; and sprinkle uponit all the blood of the burnt offering, and all the blood of thesacrifice: and the brasen altar shall be for me to enquire [by.]

{16:16} Thus did Urijah the priest, according to all that king Ahazcommanded.   

{16:17} And king Ahaz cut off the borders of the bases, and removedthe laver from off them; and took down the sea from off the brasen oxenthat [were] under it, and put it upon a pavement of stones. 

{16:18} Andthe covert for the sabbath that they had built in the house, and theking's entry without, turned he from the house of the LORD for the kingof Assyria.   

{16:19} Now the rest of the acts of Ahaz which he did, [are] theynot written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?

{16:20} And Ahaz slept with his fathers, and was buried with hisfathers in the city of David: and Hezekiah his son reigned in his stead.   

{17:1} In the twelfth year of Ahaz king of Judah began Hoshea theson of Elah to reign in Samaria over Israel nine years. 

{17:2} And hedid [that which was] evil in the sight of the LORD, but not as thekings of Israel that were before him.   

{17:3} Against him came up Shalmaneser king of Assyria; and Hosheabecame his servant, and gave him presents. 

{17:4} And the king ofAssyria found conspiracy in Hoshea: for he had sent messengers to Soking of Egypt, and brought no present to the king of Assyria, as [hehad done] year by year: therefore the king of Assyria shut him up, andbound him in prison.   

{17:5} Then the king of Assyria came up throughout all the land, andwent up to Samaria, and besieged it three years.   

{17:6} In the ninth year of Hoshea the king of Assyria took Samaria,and carried Israel away into Assyria, and placed them in Halah and inHabor [by] the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes. 

{17:7}For [so] it was, that the children of Israel had sinned against theLORD their God, which had brought them up out of the land of Egypt,from under the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and had feared othergods, 

{17:8} And walked in the statutes of the heathen, whom the LORDcast out from before the children of Israel, and of the kings ofIsrael, which they had made. 

{17:9} And the children of Israel didsecretly [those] things that [were] not right against the LORD theirGod, and they built them high places in all their cities, from thetower of the watchmen to the fenced city. 

{17:10} And they set them upimages and groves in every high hill, and under every green tree:

{17:11} And there they burnt incense in all the high places, as [did]the heathen whom the LORD carried away before them; and wrought wickedthings to provoke the LORD to anger: 

{17:12} For they served idols,whereof the LORD had said unto them, Ye shall not do this thing.

{17:13} Yet the LORD testified against Israel, and against Judah, byall the prophets, [and by] all the seers, saying, Turn ye from yourevil ways, and keep my commandments [and] my statutes, according to allthe law which I commanded your fathers, and which I sent to you by myservants the prophets. 

{17:14} Notwithstanding they would not hear, buthardened their necks, like to the neck of their fathers, that did notbelieve in the LORD their God. 

{17:15} And they rejected his statutes,and his covenant that he made with their fathers, and his testimonieswhich he testified against them; and they followed vanity, and becamevain, and went after the heathen that [were] round about them,[concerning] whom the LORD had charged them, that they should not dolike them. 

{17:16} And they left all the commandments of the LORD theirGod, and made them molten images, [even] two calves, and made a grove,and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served Baal. 

{17:17} Andthey caused their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire,and used divination and enchantments, and sold themselves to do evil inthe sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger. 

{17:18} Therefore theLORD was very angry with Israel, and removed them out of his sight:there was none left but the tribe of Judah only. 

{17:19} Also Judahkept not the commandments of the LORD their God, but walked in thestatutes of Israel which they made. 

{17:20} And the LORD rejected allthe seed of Israel, and afflicted them, and delivered them into thehand of spoilers, until he had cast them out of his sight. 

{17:21} Forhe rent Israel from the house of David; and they made Jeroboam the sonof Nebat king: and Jeroboam drave Israel from following the LORD, andmade them sin a great sin. 

{17:22} For the children of Israel walked inall the sins of Jeroboam which he did; they departed not from them;

{17:23} Until the LORD removed Israel out of his sight, as he had saidby all his servants the prophets. So was Israel carried away out oftheir own land to Assyria unto this day.   

{17:24} And the king of Assyria brought [men] from Babylon, and fromCuthah, and from Ava, and from Hamath, and from Sepharvaim, and placed[them] in the cities of Samaria instead of the children of Israel: andthey possessed Samaria, and dwelt in the cities thereof. 

{17:25} And[so] it was at the beginning of their dwelling there, [that] theyfeared not the LORD: therefore the LORD sent lions among them, whichslew [some] of them. 

{17:26} Wherefore they spake to the king ofAssyria, saying, The nations which thou hast removed, and placed in thecities of Samaria, know not the manner of the God of the land:therefore he hath sent lions among them, and, behold, they slay them,because they know not the manner of the God of the land. 

{17:27} Thenthe king of Assyria commanded, saying, Carry thither one of the priestswhom ye brought from thence; and let them go and dwell there, and lethim teach them the manner of the God of the land. 

{17:28} Then one ofthe priests whom they had carried away from Samaria came and dwelt inBethel, and taught them how they should fear the LORD. 

{17:29} Howbeitevery nation made gods of their own, and put [them] in the houses ofthe high places which the Samaritans had made, every nation in theircities wherein they dwelt. 

{17:30} And the men of Babylon madeSuccoth-benoth, and the men of Cuth made Nergal, and the men of Hamathmade Ashima, 

{17:31} And the Avites made Nibhaz and Tartak, and theSepharvites burnt their children in fire to Adrammelech and Anammelech,the gods of Sepharvaim. 

{17:32} So they feared the LORD, and made untothemselves of the lowest of them priests of the high places, whichsacrificed for them in the houses of the high places. 

{17:33} Theyfeared the LORD, and served their own gods, after the manner of thenations whom they carried away from thence. 

{17:34} Unto this day theydo after the former manners: they fear not the LORD, neither do theyafter their statutes, or after their ordinances, or after the law andcommandment which the LORD commanded the children of Jacob, whom henamed Israel; 

{17:35} With whom the LORD had made a covenant, andcharged them saying, Ye shall not fear other gods, nor bow yourselvesto them, nor serve them, nor sacrifice to them: 

{17:36} But the LORD,who brought you up out of the land of Egypt with great power and astretched out arm, him shall ye fear, and him shall ye worship, and tohim shall ye do sacrifice. 

{17:37} And the statutes, and theordinances, and the law, and the commandment, which he wrote for you,ye shall observe to do for evermore; and ye shall not fear other gods.

{17:38} And the covenant that I have made with you ye shall not forget;neither shall ye fear other gods. 

{17:39} But the LORD your God yeshall fear; and he shall deliver you out of the hand of all yourenemies. 

{17:40} Howbeit they did not hearken, but they did after theirformer manner. 

{17:41} So these nations feared the LORD, and servedtheir graven images, both their children, and their children'schildren: as did their fathers, so do they unto this day.   

{18:1} Now it came to pass in the third year of Hoshea son of Elahking of Israel, [that] Hezekiah the son of Ahaz king of Judah began toreign. 

{18:2} Twenty and five years old was he when he began to reign;and he reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem. His mother's namealso [was] Abi, the daughter of Zachariah. 

{18:3} And he did [thatwhich was] right in the sight of the LORD, according to all that Davidhis father did.   

{18:4} He removed the high places, and brake the images, and cutdown the groves, and brake in pieces the brasen serpent that Moses hadmade: for unto those days the children of Israel did burn incense toit: and he called it Nehushtan. 

{18:5} He trusted in the LORD God ofIsrael; so that after him was none like him among all the kings ofJudah, nor [any] that were before him. 

{18:6} For he clave to the LORD,[and] departed not from following him, but kept his commandments, whichthe LORD commanded Moses. 

{18:7} And the LORD was with him; [and] heprospered whithersoever he went forth: and he rebelled against the kingof Assyria, and served him not. 

{18:8} He smote the Philistines, [even]unto Gaza, and the borders thereof, from the tower of the watchmen tothe fenced city.   

{18:9} And it came to pass in the fourth year of king Hezekiah,which [was] the seventh year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel,[that] Shalmaneser king of Assyria came up against Samaria, andbesieged it. 

{18:10} And at the end of three years they took it: [even]in the sixth year of Hezekiah, that [is] the ninth year of Hoshea kingof Israel, Samaria was taken. 

{18:11} And the king of Assyria did carryaway Israel unto Assyria, and put them in Halah and in Habor [by] theriver of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes: 

{18:12} Because theyobeyed not the voice of the LORD their God, but transgressed hiscovenant, [and] all that Moses the servant of the LORD commanded, andwould not hear [them,] nor do [them. ]

{18:13} Now in the fourteenthyear of king Hezekiah did Sennacherib king of Assyria come up againstall the fenced cities of Judah, and took them. 

{18:14} And Hezekiahking of Judah sent to the king of Assyria to Lachish, saying, I haveoffended; return from me: that which thou puttest on me will I bear.And the king of Assyria appointed unto Hezekiah king of Judah threehundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold. 

{18:15} AndHezekiah gave [him] all the silver that was found in the house of theLORD, and in the treasures of the king's house. 

{18:16} At that timedid Hezekiah cut off [the gold from] the doors of the temple of theLORD, and [from] the pillars which Hezekiah king of Judah had overlaid,and gave it to the king of Assyria.   

{18:17} And the king of Assyria sent Tartan and Rabsaris andRab-shakeh from Lachish to king Hezekiah with a great host againstJerusalem. And they went up and came to Jerusalem. And when they werecome up, they came and stood by the conduit of the upper pool, which isin the highway of the fuller's field. 

{18:18} And when they had calledto the king, there came out to them Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, which[was] over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son ofAsaph the recorder. 

{18:19} And Rab- shakeh said unto them, Speak yenow to Hezekiah, Thus saith the great king, the king of Assyria, Whatconfidence is this wherein thou trustest? 

{18:20} Thou sayest, (but[they are but] vain words,) [I have] counsel and strength for the war.Now on whom dost thou trust, that thou rebellest against me? 

{18:21}Now, behold, thou trustest upon the staff of this bruised reed, [even]upon Egypt, on which if a man lean, it will go into his hand, andpierce it: so is Pharaoh king of Egypt unto all that trust on him.

{18:22} But if ye say unto me, We trust in the LORD our God: [is] notthat he, whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah hath taken away,and hath said to Judah and Jerusalem, Ye shall worship before thisaltar in Jerusalem? 

{18:23} Now therefore, I pray thee, give pledges tomy lord the king of Assyria, and I will deliver thee two thousandhorses, if thou be able on thy part to set riders upon them. 

{18:24}How then wilt thou turn away the face of one captain of the least of mymaster's servants, and put thy trust on Egypt for chariots and forhorsemen? 

{18:25} Am I now come up without the LORD against this placeto destroy it? The LORD said to me, Go up against this land, anddestroy it. 

{18:26} Then said Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, and Shebna,and Joah, unto Rab-shakeh, Speak, I pray thee, to thy servants in theSyrian language; for we understand [it:] and talk not with us in theJews' language in the ears of the people that [are] on the wall.

{18:27} But Rab-shakeh said unto them, Hath my master sent me to thymaster, and to thee, to speak these words? [hath he] not [sent me] tothe men which sit on the wall, that they may eat their own dung, anddrink their own piss with you. 

{18:28} Then Rab-shakeh stood and criedwith a loud voice in the Jews language, and spake, saying, Hear theword of the great king, the king of Assyria: 

{18:29} Thus saith theking, Let not Hezekiah deceive you: for he shall not be able to deliveryou out of his hand: 

{18:30} Neither let Hezekiah make you trust in theLORD, saying, The LORD will surely deliver us, and this city shall notbe delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria. 

{18:31} Hearken notto Hezekiah: for thus saith the king of Assyria, Make [an agreement]with me by a present, and come out to me, and [then] eat ye every manof his own vine, and every one of his fig tree, and drink ye every onethe waters of his cistern: 

{18:32} Until I come and take you away to aland like your own land, a land of corn and wine, a land of bread andvineyards, a land of oil olive and of honey, that ye may live, and notdie: and hearken not unto Hezekiah, when he persuadeth you, saying, TheLORD will deliver us. 

{18:33} Hath any of the gods of the nationsdelivered at all his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria?

{18:34} Where [are] the gods of Hamath, and of Arpad? where [are] thegods of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivah? have they delivered Samaria out ofmine hand? 

{18:35} Who [are] they among all the gods of the countries,that have delivered their country out of mine hand, that the LORDshould deliver Jerusalem out of mine hand? 

{18:36} But the people heldtheir peace, and answered him not a word: for the king's commandmentwas, saying, Answer him not. 

{18:37} Then came Eliakim the son ofHilkiah, which [was] over the household, and Shebna the scribe, andJoah the son of Asaph the recorder, to Hezekiah with [their] clothesrent, and told him the words of Rab-shakeh.   

{19:1} And it came to pass, when king Hezekiah heard [it,] that herent his clothes, and covered himself with sackcloth, and went into thehouse of the LORD. 

{19:2} And he sent Eliakim, which [was] over thehousehold, and Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests,covered with sackcloth, to Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz. 

{19:3}And they said unto him, Thus saith Hezekiah, This day [is] a day oftrouble, and of rebuke, and blasphemy: for the children are come to thebirth, and [there is] not strength to bring forth. 

{19:4} It may be theLORD thy God will hear all the words of Rab-shakeh, whom the king ofAssyria his master hath sent to reproach the living God; and willreprove the words which the LORD thy God hath heard: wherefore lift up[thy] prayer for the remnant that are left. 

{19:5} So the servants ofking Hezekiah came to Isaiah.   

{19:6} And Isaiah said unto them, Thus shall ye say to your master,Thus saith the LORD, Be not afraid of the words which thou hast heard,with which the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me.

{19:7} Behold, I will send a blast upon him, and he shall hear arumour, and shall return to his own land; and I will cause him to fallby the sword in his own land.   

{19:8} So Rab-shakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warringagainst Libnah: for he had heard that he was departed from Lachish.

{19:9} And when he heard say of Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, Behold, heis come out to fight against thee: he sent messengers again untoHezekiah, saying, 

{19:10} Thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah king ofJudah, saying, Let not thy God in whom thou trustest deceive thee,saying, Jerusalem shall not be delivered into the hand of the king ofAssyria. 

{19:11} Behold, thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria havedone to all lands, by destroying them utterly: and shalt thou bedelivered? 

{19:12} Have the gods of the nations delivered them which myfathers have destroyed; [as] Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and thechildren of Eden which [were] in Thelasar? 

{19:13} Where [is] the kingof Hamath, and the king of Arpad, and the king of the city ofSepharvaim, of Hena, and Ivah?   

{19:14} And Hezekiah received the letter of the hand of themessengers, and read it: and Hezekiah went up into the house of theLORD, and spread it before the LORD. 

{19:15} And Hezekiah prayed beforethe LORD, and said, O LORD God of Israel, which dwellest [between] thecherubims, thou art the God, [even] thou alone, of all the kingdoms ofthe earth: thou hast made heaven and earth. 

{19:16} LORD, bow downthine ear, and hear: open, LORD, thine eyes, and see: and hear thewords of Sennacherib, which hath sent him to reproach the living God.

{19:17} Of a truth, LORD, the kings of Assyria have destroyed thenations and their lands, 

{19:18} And have cast their gods into thefire: for they [were] no gods, but the work of men's hands, wood andstone: therefore they have destroyed them. 

{19:19} Now therefore, OLORD our God, I beseech thee, save thou us out of his hand, that allthe kingdoms of the earth may know that thou [art] the LORD God, [even]thou only.   

{19:20} Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying, Thussaith the LORD God of Israel, [That] which thou hast prayed to meagainst Sennacherib king of Assyria I have heard. 

{19:21} This [is] theword that the LORD hath spoken concerning him; The virgin the daughterof Zion hath despised thee, [and] laughed thee to scorn; the daughterof Jerusalem hath shaken her head at thee. 

{19:22} Whom hast thoureproached and blasphemed? and against whom hast thou exalted [thy]voice, and lifted up thine eyes on high? [even] against the Holy [One]of Israel. 

{19:23} By the messengers thou hast reproached the Lord, andhast said, With the multitude of my chariots I am come up to the heightof the mountains, to the sides of Lebanon, and will cut down the tallcedar trees thereof, [and] the choice fir trees thereof: and I willenter into the lodgings of his borders, [and into] the forest of hisCarmel. 

{19:24} I have digged and drunk strange waters, and with thesole of my feet have I dried up all the rivers of besieged places.

{19:25} Hast thou not heard long ago [how] I have done it, [and] ofancient times that I have formed it? now have I brought it to pass,that thou shouldest be to lay waste fenced cities [into] ruinous heaps.

{19:26} Therefore their inhabitants were of small power, they weredismayed and confounded; they were [as] the grass of the field, and[as] the green herb, [as] the grass on the house tops, and [as corn]blasted before it be grown up. 

{19:27} But I know thy abode, and thygoing out, and thy coming in, and thy rage against me. 

{19:28} Becausethy rage against me and thy tumult is come up into mine ears, thereforeI will put my hook in thy nose, and my bridle in thy lips, and I willturn thee back by the way by which thou camest. 

{19:29} And this [shallbe] a sign unto thee, Ye shall eat this year such things as grow ofthemselves, and in the second year that which springeth of the same;and in the third year sow ye, and reap, and plant vineyards, and eatthe fruits thereof. 

{19:30} And the remnant that is escaped of thehouse of Judah shall yet again take root downward, and bear fruitupward. 

{19:31} For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, and theythat escape out of mount Zion: the zeal of the LORD [of hosts] shall dothis. 

{19:32} Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning the king ofAssyria, He shall not come into this city, nor shoot an arrow there,nor come before it with shield, nor cast a bank against it. 

{19:33} Bythe way that he came, by the same shall he return, and shall not comeinto this city, saith the LORD. 

{19:34} For I will defend this city, tosave it, for mine own sake, and for my servant David's sake.   

{19:35} And it came to pass that night, that the angel of the LORDwent out, and smote in the camp of the Assyrians an hundred fourscoreand five thousand: and when they arose early in the morning, behold,they [were] all dead corpses. 

{19:36} So Sennacherib king of Assyriadeparted, and went and returned, and dwelt at Nineveh. 

{19:37} And itcame to pass, as he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch his god,that Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons smote him with the sword: andthey escaped into the land of Armenia. And Esar- haddon his son reignedin his stead.   

{20:1} In those days was Hezekiah sick unto death. And the prophetIsaiah the son of Amoz came to him, and said unto him, Thus saith theLORD, Set thine house in order; for thou shalt die, and not live.

{20:2} Then he turned his face to the wall, and prayed unto the LORD,saying, 

{20:3} I beseech thee, O LORD, remember now how I have walkedbefore thee in truth and with a perfect heart, and have done [thatwhich is] good in thy sight. And Hezekiah wept sore. 

{20:4} And it cameto pass, afore Isaiah was gone out into the middle court, that the wordof the LORD came to him, saying, 

{20:5} Turn again, and tell Hezekiahthe captain of my people, Thus saith the LORD, the God of David thyfather, I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy tears: behold, I willheal thee: on the third day thou shalt go up unto the house of theLORD. 

{20:6} And I will add unto thy days fifteen years; and I willdeliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria; andI will defend this city for mine own sake, and for my servant David'ssake. 

{20:7} And Isaiah said, Take a lump of figs. And they took andlaid [it] on the boil, and he recovered.   

{20:8} And Hezekiah said unto Isaiah, What [shall be] the sign thatthe LORD will heal me, and that I shall go up into the house of theLORD the third day? 

{20:9} And Isaiah said, This sign shalt thou haveof the LORD, that the LORD will do the thing that he hath spoken: shallthe shadow go forward ten degrees, or go back ten degrees? 

{20:10} AndHezekiah answered, It is a light thing for the shadow to go down tendegrees: nay, but let the shadow return backward ten degrees. 

{20:11}And Isaiah the prophet cried unto the LORD: and he brought the shadowten degrees backward, by which it had gone down in the dial of Ahaz.   

{20:12} At that time Berodach-baladan, the son of Baladan, king ofBabylon, sent letters and a present unto Hezekiah: for he had heardthat Hezekiah had been sick. 

{20:13} And Hezekiah hearkened unto them,and shewed them all the house of his precious things, the silver, andthe gold, and the spices, and the precious ointment, and [all] thehouse of his armour, and all that was found in his treasures: there wasnothing in his house, nor in all his dominion, that Hezekiah shewedthem not.   

{20:14} Then came Isaiah the prophet unto king Hezekiah, and saidunto him, What said these men? and from whence came they unto thee? AndHezekiah said, They are come from a far country, [even] from Babylon.

{20:15} And he said, What have they seen in thine house? And Hezekiahanswered, All [the things] that [are] in mine house have they seen:there is nothing among my treasures that I have not shewed them.

{20:16} And Isaiah said unto Hezekiah, Hear the word of the LORD.

{20:17} Behold, the days come, that all that [is] in thine house,andthat which thy fathers have laid up in store unto this day, shall becarried into Babylon: nothing shall be left, saith the LORD. 

{20:18}And of thy sons that shall issue from thee, which thou shalt beget,shall they take away; and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of theking of Babylon. 

{20:19} Then said Hezekiah unto Isaiah, Good is theword of the LORD which thou hast spoken. And he said, [Is it] not[good,] if peace and truth be in my days?   

{20:20} And the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and all his might, andhow he made a pool, and a conduit, and brought water into the city,[are] they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings ofJudah? 

{20:21} And Hezekiah slept with his fathers: and Manasseh hisson reigned in his stead.   

{21:1} Manasseh [was] twelve years old when he began to reign, andreigned fifty and five years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name [was]Hephzi-bah. 

{21:2} And he did [that which was] evil in the sight of theLORD, after the abominations of the heathen, whom the LORD cast outbefore the children of Israel. 

{21:3} For he built up again the highplaces which Hezekiah his father had destroyed; and he reared up altarsfor Baal, and made a grove, as did Ahab king of Israel; and worshippedall the host of heaven, and served them. 

{21:4} And he built altars inthe house of the LORD, of which the LORD said, In Jerusalem will I putmy name. 

{21:5} And he built altars for all the host of heaven in thetwo courts of the house of the LORD. 

{21:6} And he made his son passthrough the fire, and observed times, and used enchantments, and dealtwith familiar spirits and wizards: he wrought much wickedness in thesight of the LORD, to provoke [him] to anger. 

{21:7} And he set agraven image of the grove that he had made in the house, of which theLORD said to David, and to Solomon his son, In this house, and inJerusalem, which I have chosen out of all tribes of Israel, will I putmy name for ever: 

{21:8} Neither will I make the feet of Israel moveany more out of the land which I gave their fathers; only if they willobserve to do according to all that I have commanded them, andaccording to all the law that my servant Moses commanded them. 

{21:9}But they hearkened not: and Manasseh seduced them to do more evil thandid the nations whom the LORD destroyed before the children of Israel.   

{21:10} And the LORD spake by his servants the prophets, saying,

{21:11} Because Manasseh king of Judah hath done these abominations,[and] hath done wickedly above all that the Amorites did, which [were]before him, and hath made Judah also to sin with his idols: 

{21:12}Therefore thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Behold, I [am] bringing[such] evil upon Jerusalem and Judah, that whosoever heareth of it,both his ears shall tingle. 

{21:13} And I will stretch over Jerusalemthe line of Samaria, and the plummet of the house of Ahab: and I willwipe Jerusalem as [a man] wipeth a dish, wiping [it,] and turning [it]upside down. 

{21:14} And I will forsake the remnant of mineinheritance, and deliver them into the hand of their enemies; and theyshall become a prey and a spoil to all their enemies; 

{21:15} Becausethey have done [that which was] evil in my sight,and have provoked meto anger, since the day their fathers came forth out of Egypt, evenunto this day. 

{21:16} Moreover Manasseh shed innocent blood very much,till he had filled Jerusalem from one end to another; beside his sinwherewith he made Judah to sin, in doing [that which was] evil in thesight of the LORD.   

{21:17} Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and all that he did,and his sin that he sinned, [are] they not written in the book of thechronicles of the kings of Judah? 

{21:18} And Manasseh slept with hisfathers, and was buried in the garden of his own house, in the gardenof Uzza: and Amon his son reigned in his stead.   

{21:19} Amon [was] twenty and two years old when he began to reign,and he reigned two years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name [was]Meshullemeth, the daughter of Haruz of Jotbah. 

{21:20} And he did [thatwhich was] evil in the sight of the LORD, as his father Manasseh did.

{21:21} And he walked in all the way that his father walked in, andserved the idols that his father served, and worshipped them: 

{21:22}And he forsook the LORD God of his fathers, and walked not in the wayof the LORD.   

{21:23} And the servants of Amon conspired against him, and slew theking in his own house. 

{21:24} And the people of the land slew all themthat had conspired against king Amon; and the people of the land madeJosiah his son king in his stead. 

{21:25} Now the rest of the acts ofAmon which he did, [are] they not written in the book of the chroniclesof the kings of Judah? 

{21:26} And he was buried in his sepulchre inthe garden of Uzza: and Josiah his son reigned in his stead.   

{22:1} Josiah [was] eight years old when he began to reign, and hereigned thirty and one years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name [was]Jedidah, the daughter of Adaiah of Boscath. 

{22:2} And he did [thatwhich was] right in the sight of the LORD, and walked in all the way ofDavid his father, and turned not aside to the right hand or to the left.   

{22:3} And it came to pass in the eighteenth year of king Josiah,[that] the king sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, the son of Meshullam,the scribe, to the house of the LORD, saying, 

{22:4} Go up to Hilkiahthe high priest, that he may sum the silver which is brought into thehouse of the LORD, which the keepers of the door have gathered of thepeople: 

{22:5} And let them deliver it into the hand of the doers ofthe work, that have the oversight of the house of the LORD: and letthem give it to the doers of the work which [is] in the house of theLORD, to repair the breaches of the house, 

{22:6} Unto carpenters, andbuilders, and masons, and to buy timber and hewn stone to repair thehouse. 

{22:7} Howbeit there was no reckoning made with them of themoney that was delivered into their hand, because they dealt faithfully.   

{22:8} And Hilkiah the high priest said unto Shaphan the scribe, Ihave found the book of the law in the house of the LORD. And Hilkiahgave the book to Shaphan, and he read it. 

{22:9} And Shaphan the scribecame to the king, and brought the king word again, and said, Thyservants have gathered the money that was found in the house, and havedelivered it into the hand of them that do the work, that have theoversight of the house of the LORD. 

{22:10} And Shaphan the scribeshewed the king, saying, Hilkiah the priest hath delivered me a book.And Shaphan read it before the king. 

{22:11} And it came to pass, whenthe king had heard the words of the book of the law, that he rent hisclothes. 

{22:12} And the king commanded Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikamthe son of Shaphan, and Achbor the son of Michaiah, and Shaphan thescribe, and Asahiah a servant of the king's, saying, 

{22:13} Go ye,enquire of the LORD for me, and for the people, and for all Judah,concerning the words of this book that is found: for great is the wrathof the LORD that is kindled against us, because our fathers have nothearkened unto the words of this book, to do according unto all thatwhich is written concerning us. 

{22:14} So Hilkiah the priest, andAhikam, and Achbor, and Shaphan, and Asahiah, went unto Huldah theprophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvah, the son of Harhas,keeper of the wardrobe; (now she dwelt in Jerusalem in the college;)and they communed with her.   

{22:15} And she said unto them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel,Tell the man that sent you to me, 

{22:16} Thus saith the LORD, Behold,I will bring evil upon this place, and upon the inhabitants thereof,[even] all the words of the book which the king of Judah hath read:

{22:17} Because they have forsaken me, and have burned incense untoother gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the works oftheir hands; therefore my wrath shall be kindled against this place,and shall not be quenched. 

{22:18} But to the king of Judah which sentyou to enquire of the LORD, thus shall ye say to him, Thus saith theLORD God of Israel, [As touching] the words which thou hast heard;

{22:19} Because thine heart was tender, and thou hast humbled thyselfbefore the LORD, when thou heardest what I spake against this place,and against the inhabitants thereof, that they should become adesolation and a curse, and hast rent thy clothes, and wept before me;I also have heard [thee,] saith the LORD. 

{22:20} Behold therefore, Iwill gather thee unto thy fathers, and thou shalt be gathered into thygrave in peace; and thine eyes shall not see all the evil which I willbring upon this place. And they brought the king word again.   

{23:1} And the king sent, and they gathered unto him all the eldersof Judah and of Jerusalem. 

{23:2} And the king went up into the houseof the LORD, and all the men of Judah and all the inhabitants ofJerusalem with him, and the priests, and the prophets, and all thepeople, both small and great: and he read in their ears all the wordsof the book of the covenant which was found in the house of the LORD.   

{23:3} And the king stood by a pillar, and made a covenant beforethe LORD, to walk after the LORD, and to keep his commandments and histestimonies and his statutes with all [their] heart and all [their]soul, to perform the words of this covenant that were written in thisbook. And all the people stood to the covenant. 

{23:4} And the kingcommanded Hilkiah the high priest, and the priests of the second order,and the keepers of the door, to bring forth out of the temple of theLORD all the vessels that were made for Baal, and for the grove, andfor all the host of heaven: and he burned them without Jerusalem in thefields of Kidron, and carried the ashes of them unto Bethel. 

{23:5} Andhe put down the idolatrous priests, whom the kings of Judah hadordained to burn incense in the high places in the cities of Judah, andin the places round about Jerusalem; them also that burned incense untoBaal, to the sun, and to the moon, and to the planets, and to all thehost of heaven. 

{23:6} And he brought out the grove from the house ofthe LORD, without Jerusalem, unto the brook Kidron, and burned it atthe brook Kidron, and stamped [it] small to powder, and cast the powderthereof upon the graves of the children of the people. 

{23:7} And hebrake down the houses of the sodomites, that [were] by the house of theLORD, where the women wove hangings for the grove. 

{23:8} And hebrought all the priests out of the cities of Judah, and defiled thehigh places where the priests had burned incense, from Geba toBeer-sheba, and brake down the high places of the gates that [were] inthe entering in of the gate of Joshua the governor of the city, which[were] on a man's left hand at the gate of the city. 

{23:9}Nevertheless the priests of the high places came not up to the altar ofthe LORD in Jerusalem, but they did eat of the unleavened bread amongtheir brethren. 

{23:10} And he defiled Topheth, which [is] in thevalley of the children of Hinnom, that no man might make his son or hisdaughter to pass through the fire to Molech. 

{23:11} And he took awaythe horses that the kings of Judah had given to the sun, at theentering in of the house of the LORD, by the chamber of Nathan- melechthe chamberlain, which [was] in the suburbs, and burned the chariots ofthe sun with fire. 

{23:12} And the altars that [were] on the top of theupper chamber of Ahaz, which the kings of Judah had made, and thealtars which Manasseh had made in the two courts of the house of theLORD, did the king beat down, and brake [them] down from thence, andcast the dust of them into the brook Kidron. 

{23:13} And the highplaces that [were] before Jerusalem, which [were] on the right hand ofthe mount of corruption, which Solomon the king of Israel had buildedfor Ashtoreth the abomination of the Zidonians, and for Chemosh theabomination of the Moabites, and for Milcom the abomination of thechildren of Ammon, did the king defile. 

{23:14} And he brake in piecesthe images, and cut down the groves, and filled their places with thebones of men.   

{23:15} Moreover the altar that [was] at Bethel, [and] the highplace which Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin, hadmade, both that altar and the high place he brake down, and burned thehigh place, [and] stamped [it] small to powder, and burned the grove.

{23:16} And as Josiah turned himself, he spied the sepulchres that[were] there in the mount, and sent, and took the bones out of thesepulchres, and burned [them] upon the altar, and polluted it,according to the word of the LORD which the man of God proclaimed, whoproclaimed these words. 

{23:17} Then he said, What title [is] that thatI see? And the men of the city told him, [It is] the sepulchre of theman of God, which came from Judah, and proclaimed these things thatthou hast done against the altar of Bethel. 

{23:18} And he said, Lethim alone; let no man move his bones. So they let his bones alone, withthe bones of the prophet that came out of Samaria. 

{23:19} And all thehouses also of the high places that [were] in the cities of Samaria,which the kings of Israel had made to provoke [the LORD] to anger,Josiah took away, and did to them according to all the acts that he haddone in Bethel. 

{23:20} And he slew all the priests of the high placesthat [were] there upon the altars, and burned men's bones upon them,and returned to Jerusalem.   

{23:21} And the king commanded all the people, saying, Keep thepassover unto the LORD your God, as [it is] written in the book of thiscovenant. 

{23:22} Surely there was not holden such a passover from thedays of the judges that judged Israel, nor in all the days of the kingsof Israel, nor of the kings of Judah; 

{23:23} But in the eighteenthyear of king Josiah, [wherein] this passover was holden to the LORD inJerusalem.   

{23:24} Moreover the [workers with] familiar spirits, and thewizards, and the images, and the idols, and all the abominations thatwere spied in the land of Judah and in Jerusalem, did Josiah put away,that he might perform the words of the law which were written in thebook that Hilkiah the priest found in the house of the LORD. 

{23:25}And like unto him was there no king before him, that turned to the LORDwith all his heart, and with all his soul, and with all his might,according to all the law of Moses; neither after him arose there [any]like him.   

{23:26} Notwithstanding the LORD turned not from the fierceness ofhis great wrath, wherewith his anger was kindled against Judah, becauseof all the provocations that Manasseh had provoked him withal. 

{23:27}And the LORD said, I will remove Judah also out of my sight, as I haveremoved Israel, and will cast off this city Jerusalem which I havechosen, and the house of which I said, My name shall be there. 

{23:28}Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and all that he did, [are] they notwritten in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?   

{23:29} In his days Pharaoh-nechoh king of Egypt went up against theking of Assyria to the river Euphrates: and king Josiah went againsthim; and he slew him at Megiddo, when he had seen him. 

{23:30} And hisservants carried him in a chariot dead from Megiddo, and brought him toJerusalem, and buried him in his own sepulchre. And the people of theland took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah, and anointed him, and made himking in his father's stead.   

{23:31} Jehoahaz [was] twenty and three years old when he began toreign; and he reigned three months in Jerusalem. And his mother's name[was] Hamutal, the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah. 

{23:32} And he did[that which was] evil in the sight of the LORD, according to all thathis fathers had done. 

{23:33} And Pharaoh-nechoh put him in bands atRiblah in the land of Hamath, that he might not reign in Jerusalem; andput the land to a tribute of an hundred talents of silver, and a talentof gold. 

{23:34} And Pharaoh- nechoh made Eliakim the son of Josiahking in the room of Josiah his father, and turned his name toJehoiakim, and took Jehoahaz away: and he came to Egypt, and diedthere. 

{23:35} And Jehoiakim gave the silver and the gold to Pharaoh;but he taxed the land to give the money according to the commandment ofPharaoh: he exacted the silver and the gold of the people of the land,of every one according to his taxation, to give [it] untoPharaoh-nechoh.   

{23:36} Jehoiakim [was] twenty and five years old when he began toreign; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name[was] Zebudah, the daughter of Pedaiah of Rumah. 

{23:37} And he did[that which was] evil in the sight of the LORD, according to all thathis fathers had done.   

{24:1} In his days Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up, andJehoiakim became his servant three years: then he turned and rebelledagainst him. 

{24:2} And the LORD sent against him bands of theChaldees, and bands of the Syrians, and bands of the Moabites, andbands of the children of Ammon, and sent them against Judah to destroyit, according to the word of the LORD, which he spake by his servantsthe prophets. 

{24:3} Surely at the commandment of the LORD came [this]upon Judah, to remove [them] out of his sight, for the sins ofManasseh, according to all that he did; 

{24:4} And also for theinnocent blood that he shed: for he filled Jerusalem with innocentblood; which the LORD would not pardon.   

{24:5} Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, and all that he did,[are] they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings ofJudah? 

{24:6} So Jehoiakim slept with his fathers: and Jehoiachin hisson reigned in his stead. 

{24:7} And the king of Egypt came not againany more out of his land: for the king of Babylon had taken from theriver of Egypt unto the river Euphrates all that pertained to the kingof Egypt.   

{24:8} Jehoiachin [was] eighteen years old when he began to reign,and he reigned in Jerusalem three months. And his mother's name [was]Nehushta, the daughter of Elnathan of Jerusalem. 

{24:9} And he did[that which was] evil in the sight of the LORD, according to all thathis father had done.   

{24:10} At that time the servants of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babyloncame up against Jerusalem, and the city was besieged. 

{24:11} AndNebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came against the city, and his servantsdid besiege it. 

{24:12} And Jehoiachin the king of Judah went out tothe king of Babylon, he, and his mother, and his servants, and hisprinces, and his officers: and the king of Babylon took him in theeighth year of his reign. 

{24:13} And he carried out thence all thetreasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king'shouse, and cut in pieces all the vessels of gold which Solomon king ofIsrael had made in the temple of the LORD, as the LORD had said.

{24:14} And he carried away all Jerusalem, and all the princes, and allthe mighty men of valour, [even] ten thousand captives, and all thecraftsmen and smiths: none remained, save the poorest sort of thepeople of the land. 

{24:15} And he carried away Jehoiachin to Babylon,and the king's mother, and the king's wives, and his officers, and themighty of the land, [those] carried he into captivity from Jerusalem toBabylon. 

{24:16} And all the men of might, [even] seven thousand, andcraftsmen and smiths a thousand, all [that were] strong [and] apt forwar, even them the king of Babylon brought captive to Babylon.   

{24:17} And the king of Babylon made Mattaniah his father's brotherking in his stead, and changed his name to Zedekiah. 

{24:18} Zedekiah[was] twenty and one years old when he began to reign, and he reignedeleven years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name [was] Hamutal, thedaughter of Jeremiah of Libnah. 

{24:19} And he did [that which was]evil in the sight of the LORD, according to all that Jehoiakim haddone. 

{24:20} For through the anger of the LORD it came to pass inJerusalem and Judah, until he had cast them out from his presence, thatZedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.   

{25:1} And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in thetenth month, in the tenth [day] of the month, [that] Nebuchadnezzarking of Babylon came, he, and all his host, against Jerusalem, andpitched against it; and they built forts against it round about. 

{25:2}And the city was besieged unto the eleventh year of king Zedekiah.

{25:3} And on the ninth [day] of the [fourth] month the famineprevailed in the city, and there was no bread for the people of theland.   

{25:4} And the city was broken up, and all the men of war [fled] bynight by the way of the gate between two walls, which [is] by theking's garden: (now the Chaldees [were] against the city round about:)and [the king] went the way toward the plain. 

{25:5} And the army ofthe Chaldees pursued after the king, and overtook him in the plains ofJericho: and all his army were scattered from him. 

{25:6} So they tookthe king, and brought him up to the king of Babylon to Riblah; and theygave judgment upon him. 

{25:7} And they slew the sons of Zedekiahbefore his eyes, and put out the eyes of Zedekiah, and bound him withfetters of brass, and carried him to Babylon.   

{25:8} And in the fifth month, on the seventh [day] of the month,which [is] the nineteenth year of king Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon,came Nebuzar-adan, captain of the guard, a servant of the king ofBabylon, unto Jerusalem: 

{25:9} And he burnt the house of the LORD, andthe king's house, and all the houses of Jerusalem, and every great[man's] house burnt he with fire. 

{25:10} And all the army of theChaldees, that [were with] the captain of the guard, brake down thewalls of Jerusalem round about. 

{25:11} Now the rest of the people[that were] left in the city, and the fugitives that fell away to theking of Babylon, with the remnant of the multitude, did Nebuzar-adanthe captain of the guard carry away. 

{25:12} But the captain of theguard left of the poor of the land [to be] vinedressers and husbandmen.

{25:13} And the pillars of brass that [were] in the house of the LORD,and the bases, and the brasen sea that [was] in the house of the LORD,did the Chaldees break in pieces, and carried the brass of them toBabylon. 

{25:14} And the pots, and the shovels, and the snuffers, andthe spoons, and all the vessels of brass wherewith they ministered,took they away. 

{25:15} And the firepans, and the bowls, [and] suchthings as [were] of gold, [in] gold, and of silver, [in] silver, thecaptain of the guard took away. 

{25:16} The two pillars, one sea, andthe bases which Solomon had made for the house of the LORD; the brassof all these vessels was without weight. 

{25:17} The height of the onepillar [was] eighteen cubits, and the chapiter upon it [was] brass: andthe height of the chapiter three cubits; and the wreathen work, andpomegranates upon the chapiter round about, all of brass: and like untothese had the second pillar with wreathen work.   

{25:18} And the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest,and Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the door:

{25:19} And out of the city he took an officer that was set over themen of war, and five men of them that were in the king's presence,which were found in the city, and the principal scribe of the host,which mustered the people of the land, and threescore men of the peopleof the land [that were] found in the city: 

{25:20} And Nebuzar-adancaptain of the guard took these, and brought them to the king ofBabylon to Riblah: 

{25:21} And the king of Babylon smote them, and slewthem at Riblah in the land of Hamath. So Judah was carried away out oftheir land.   

{25:22} And [as for] the people that remained in the land of Judah,whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had left, even over them he madeGedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, ruler. 

{25:23} And whenall the captains of the armies, they and their men, heard that the kingof Babylon had made Gedaliah governor, there came to Gedaliah toMizpah, even Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan the son ofCareah, and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth the Netophathite, andJaazaniah the son of a Maachathite, they and their men. 

{25:24} AndGedaliah sware to them, and to their men, and said unto them, Fear notto be the servants of the Chaldees: dwell in the land, and serve theking of Babylon; and it shall be well with you. 

{25:25} But it came topass in the seventh month, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, the sonof Elishama, of the seed royal, came, and ten men with him, and smoteGedaliah, that he died, and the Jews and the Chaldees that were withhim at Mizpah. 

{25:26} And all the people, both small and great, andthe captains of the armies, arose, and came to Egypt: for they wereafraid of the Chaldees.   

{25:27} And it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of thecaptivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, on theseven and twentieth [day] of the month, [that] Evil-merodach king ofBabylon in the year that he began to reign did lift up the head ofJehoiachin king of Judah out of prison; 

{25:28} And he spake kindly tohim, and set his throne above the throne of the kings that [were] withhim in Babylon; 

{25:29} And changed his prison garments: and he did eatbread continually before him all the days of his life. 

{25:30} And hisallowance [was] a continual allowance given him of the king, a dailyrate for every day, all the days of his life.
