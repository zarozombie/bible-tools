{The Book of the Prophet Isaiah   

{1:1} The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerningJudah and Jerusalem in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, [and]Hezekiah, kings of Judah. 

{1:2} Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth:for the LORD hath spoken, I have nourished and brought up children, andthey have rebelled against me. 

{1:3} The ox knoweth his owner, and theass his master's crib: [but] Israel doth not know, my people doth notconsider. 

{1:4} Ah sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a seedof evildoers, children that are corrupters: they have forsaken theLORD, they have provoked the Holy One of Israel unto anger, they aregone away backward.   

{1:5} Why should ye be stricken any more? ye will revolt more andmore: the whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint. 

{1:6} From thesole of the foot even unto the head [there is] no soundness in it;[but] wounds, and bruises, and putrifying sores: they have not beenclosed, neither bound up, neither mollified with ointment. 

{1:7} Yourcountry [is] desolate, your cities [are] burned with fire: your land,strangers devour it in your presence, and [it is] desolate, asoverthrown by strangers. 

{1:8} And the daughter of Zion is left as acottage in a vineyard, as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers, as abesieged city. 

{1:9} Except the LORD of hosts had left unto us a verysmall remnant, we should have been as Sodom, [and] we should have beenlike unto Gomorrah.   

{1:10} Hear the word of the LORD, ye rulers of Sodom; give ear untothe law of our God, ye people of Gomorrah. 

{1:11} To what purpose [is]the multitude of your sacrifices unto me? saith the LORD: I am full ofthe burnt offerings of rams, and the fat of fed beasts; and I delightnot in the blood of bullocks, or of lambs, or of he goats. 

{1:12} Whenye come to appear before me, who hath required this at your hand, totread my courts? 

{1:13} Bring no more vain oblations; incense is anabomination unto me; the new moons and sabbaths, the calling ofassemblies, I cannot away with; [it is] iniquity, even the solemnmeeting. 

{1:14} Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soulhateth: they are a trouble unto me; I am weary to bear [them. ]

{1:15}And when ye spread forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes from you:yea, when ye make many prayers, I will not hear: your hands are full ofblood.   

{1:16} Wash you, make you clean; put away the evil of your doingsfrom before mine eyes; cease to do evil; 

{1:17} Learn to do well; seekjudgment, relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead for thewidow. 

{1:18} Come now, and let us reason together, saith the LORD:though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; thoughthey be red like crimson, they shall be as wool. 

{1:19} If ye bewilling and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the land: 

{1:20} But ifye refuse and rebel, ye shall be devoured with the sword: for the mouthof the LORD hath spoken [it.]   

{1:21} How is the faithful city become an harlot! it was full ofjudgment; righteousness lodged in it; but now murderers. 

{1:22} Thysilver is become dross, thy wine mixed with water: 

{1:23} Thy princes[are] rebellious, and companions of thieves: every one loveth gifts,and followeth after rewards: they judge not the fatherless, neitherdoth the cause of the widow come unto them. 

{1:24} Therefore saith theLord, the LORD of hosts, the mighty One of Israel, Ah, I will ease meof mine adversaries, and avenge me of mine enemies:   

{1:25} And I will turn my hand upon thee, and purely purge away thydross, and take away all thy tin: 

{1:26} And I will restore thy judgesas at the first, and thy counsellors as at the beginning: afterwardthou shalt be called, The city of righteousness, the faithful city.

{1:27} Zion shall be redeemed with judgment, and her converts withrighteousness.   

{1:28} And the destruction of the transgressors and of the sinners[shall be] together, and they that forsake the LORD shall be consumed.

{1:29} For they shall be ashamed of the oaks which ye have desired, andye shall be confounded for the gardens that ye have chosen. 

{1:30} Forye shall be as an oak whose leaf fadeth, and as a garden that hath nowater. 

{1:31} And the strong shall be as tow, and the maker of it as aspark, and they shall both burn together, and none shall quench [them.]   

{2:1} The word that Isaiah the son of Amoz saw concerning Judah andJerusalem. 

{2:2} And it shall come to pass in the last days, [that] themountain of the LORD'S house shall be established in the top of themountains, and shall be exalted above the hills; and all nations shallflow unto it. 

{2:3} And many people shall go and say, Come ye, and letus go up to the mountain of the LORD, to the house of the God of Jacob;and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths: forout of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the LORD fromJerusalem. 

{2:4} And he shall judge among the nations, and shall rebukemany people: and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, andtheir spears into pruninghooks: nation shall not lift up sword againstnation, neither shall they learn war any more. 

{2:5} O house of Jacob,come ye, and let us walk in the light of the LORD.   

{2:6} Therefore thou hast forsaken thy people the house of Jacob,because they be replenished from the east, and [are] soothsayers likethe Philistines, and they please themselves in the children ofstrangers. 

{2:7} Their land also is full of silver and gold, neither[is there any] end of their treasures; their land is also full ofhorses, neither [is there any] end of their chariots: 

{2:8} Their landalso is full of idols; they worship the work of their own hands, thatwhich their own fingers have made: 

{2:9} And the mean man boweth down,and the great man humbleth himself: therefore forgive them not.   

{2:10} Enter into the rock, and hide thee in the dust, for fear ofthe LORD, and for the glory of his majesty. 

{2:11} The lofty looks ofman shall be humbled, and the haughtiness of men shall be bowed down,and the LORD alone shall be exalted in that day. 

{2:12} For the day ofthe LORD of hosts [shall be] upon every [one that is] proud and lofty,and upon every [one that is] lifted up; and he shall be brought low:

{2:13} And upon all the cedars of Lebanon, [that are] high and liftedup, and upon all the oaks of Bashan, 

{2:14} And upon all the highmountains, and upon all the hills [that are] lifted up, 

{2:15} And uponevery high tower, and upon every fenced wall, 

{2:16} And upon all theships of Tarshish, and upon all pleasant pictures. 

{2:17} And theloftiness of man shall be bowed down, and the haughtiness of men shallbe made low: and the LORD alone shall be exalted in that day. 

{2:18}And the idols he shall utterly abolish. 

{2:19} And they shall go intothe holes of the rocks, and into the caves of the earth, for fear ofthe LORD, and for the glory of his majesty, when he ariseth to shaketerribly the earth. 

{2:20} In that day a man shall cast his idols ofsilver, and his idols of gold, which they made [each one] for himselfto worship, to the moles and to the bats; 

{2:21} To go into the cleftsof the rocks, and into the tops of the ragged rocks, for fear of theLORD, and for the glory of his majesty, when he ariseth to shaketerribly the earth. 

{2:22} Cease ye from man, whose breath [is] in hisnostrils: for wherein is he to be accounted of?   

{3:1} For, behold, the Lord, the LORD of hosts, doth take away fromJerusalem and from Judah the stay and the staff, the whole stay ofbread, and the whole stay of water, 

{3:2} The mighty man, and the manof war, the judge, and the prophet, and the prudent, and the ancient,

{3:3} The captain of fifty, and the honourable man, and the counsellor,and the cunning artificer, and the eloquent orator. 

{3:4} And I willgive children [to be] their princes, and babes shall rule over them.

{3:5} And the people shall be oppressed, every one by another, andevery one by his neighbour: the child shall behave himself proudlyagainst the ancient, and the base against the honourable. 

{3:6} When aman shall take hold of his brother of the house of his father,[saying,] Thou hast clothing, be thou our ruler, and [let] this ruin[be] under thy hand: 

{3:7} In that day shall he swear, saying, I willnot be an healer; for in my house [is] neither bread nor clothing: makeme not a ruler of the people. 

{3:8} For Jerusalem is ruined, and Judahis fallen: because their tongue and their doings [are] against theLORD, to provoke the eyes of his glory.   

{3:9} The shew of their countenance doth witness against them; andthey declare their sin as Sodom, they hide [it] not. Woe unto theirsoul! for they have rewarded evil unto themselves. 

{3:10} Say ye to therighteous, that [it shall be] well [with him:] for they shall eat thefruit of their doings. 

{3:11} Woe unto the wicked! [it shall be] ill[with him:] for the reward of his hands shall be given him.   

{3:12} [As for] my people, children [are] their oppressors, andwomen rule over them. O my people, they which lead thee cause [thee] toerr, and destroy the way of thy paths. 

{3:13} The LORD standeth up toplead, and standeth to judge the people. 

{3:14} The LORD will enterinto judgment with the ancients of his people, and the princes thereof:for ye have eaten up the vineyard; the spoil of the poor [is] in yourhouses. 

{3:15} What mean ye [that] ye beat my people to pieces, andgrind the faces of the poor? saith the LORD GOD of hosts.   

{3:16} Moreover the LORD saith, Because the daughters of Zion arehaughty, and walk with stretched forth necks and wanton eyes, walkingand mincing [as] they go, and making a tinkling with their feet: 

{3:17}Therefore the LORD will smite with a scab the crown of the head of thedaughters of Zion, and the LORD will discover their secret parts.

{3:18} In that day the Lord will take away the bravery of [their]tinkling ornaments [about their feet,] and [their] cauls, and [their]round tires like the moon, 

{3:19} The chains, and the bracelets, andthe mufflers, 

{3:20} The bonnets, and the ornaments of the legs, andthe headbands, and the tablets, and the earrings, 

{3:21} The rings, andnose jewels, 

{3:22} The changeable suits of apparel, and the mantles,and the wimples, and the crisping pins, 

{3:23} The glasses, and thefine linen, and the hoods, and the vails. 

{3:24} And it shall come topass, [that] instead of sweet smell there shall be stink; and insteadof a girdle a rent; and instead of well set hair baldness; and insteadof a stomacher a girding of sackcloth; [and] burning instead of beauty.

{3:25} Thy men shall fall by the sword, and thy mighty in the war.

{3:26} And her gates shall lament and mourn; and she [being] desolateshall sit upon the ground.   

{4:1} And in that day seven women shall take hold of one man,saying, We will eat our own bread, and wear our own apparel: only letus be called by thy name, to take away our reproach. 

{4:2} In that dayshall the branch of the LORD be beautiful and glorious, and the fruitof the earth [shall be] excellent and comely for them that are escapedof Israel. 

{4:3} And it shall come to pass, [that he that is] left inZion, and [he that] remaineth in Jerusalem, shall be called holy,[even] every one that is written among the living in Jerusalem: 

{4:4}When the Lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughters ofZion, and shall have purged the blood of Jerusalem from the midstthereof by the spirit of judgment, and by the spirit of burning. 

{4:5}And the LORD will create upon every dwelling place of mount Zion, andupon her assemblies, a cloud and smoke by day, and the shining of aflaming fire by night: for upon all the glory [shall be] a defence.

{4:6} And there shall be a tabernacle for a shadow in the daytime fromthe heat, and for a place of refuge, and for a covert from storm andfrom rain.   

{5:1} Now will I sing to my wellbeloved a song of my belovedtouching his vineyard. My wellbeloved hath a vineyard in a veryfruitful hill: 

{5:2} And he fenced it, and gathered out the stonesthereof, and planted it with the choicest vine, and built a tower inthe midst of it, and also made a winepress therein: and he looked thatit should bring forth grapes, and it brought forth wild grapes. 

{5:3}And now, O inhabitants of Jerusalem, and men of Judah, judge, I prayyou, betwixt me and my vineyard. 

{5:4} What could have been done moreto my vineyard, that I have not done in it? wherefore, when I lookedthat it should bring forth grapes, brought it forth wild grapes? 

{5:5}And now go to; I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard: I willtake away the hedge thereof, and it shall be eaten up; [and] break downthe wall thereof, and it shall be trodden down: 

{5:6} And I will lay itwaste: it shall not be pruned, nor digged; but there shall come upbriers and thorns: I will also command the clouds that they rain norain upon it. 

{5:7} For the vineyard of the LORD of hosts [is] thehouse of Israel, and the men of Judah his pleasant plant: and he lookedfor judgment, but behold oppression; for righteousness, but behold acry.   

{5:8} Woe unto them that join house to house, [that] lay field tofield, till [there be] no place, that they may be placed alone in themidst of the earth! 

{5:9} In mine ears [said] the LORD of hosts, Of atruth many houses shall be desolate, [even] great and fair, withoutinhabitant. 

{5:10} Yea, ten acres of vineyard shall yield one bath, andthe seed of an homer shall yield an ephah.   

{5:11} Woe unto them that rise up early in the morning, [that] theymay follow strong drink; that continue until night, [till] wine inflamethem! 

{5:12} And the harp, and the viol, the tabret, and pipe, andwine, are in their feasts: but they regard not the work of the LORD,neither consider the operation of his hands.   

{5:13} Therefore my people are gone into captivity, because [theyhave] no knowledge: and their honourable men [are] famished, and theirmultitude dried up with thirst. 

{5:14} Therefore hell hath enlargedherself, and opened her mouth without measure: and their glory, andtheir multitude, and their pomp, and he that rejoiceth, shall descendinto it. 

{5:15} And the mean man shall be brought down, and the mightyman shall be humbled, and the eyes of the lofty shall be humbled:

{5:16} But the LORD of hosts shall be exalted in judgment, and God thatis holy shall be sanctified in righteousness. 

{5:17} Then shall thelambs feed after their manner, and the waste places of the fat onesshall strangers eat. 

{5:18} Woe unto them that draw iniquity with cordsof vanity, and sin as it were with a cart rope: 

{5:19} That say, Lethim make speed, [and] hasten his work, that we may see it: and let thecounsel of the Holy One of Israel draw nigh and come, that we may know[it!]   

{5:20} Woe unto them that call evil good, and good evil; that putdarkness for light, and light for darkness; that put bitter for sweet,and sweet for bitter! 

{5:21} Woe unto [them that are] wise in their owneyes, and prudent in their own sight! 

{5:22} Woe unto [them that are]mighty to drink wine, and men of strength to mingle strong drink:

{5:23} Which justify the wicked for reward, and take away therighteousness of the righteous from him! 

{5:24} Therefore as the firedevoureth the stubble, and the flame consumeth the chaff, [so] theirroot shall be as rottenness, and their blossom shall go up as dust:because they have cast away the law of the LORD of hosts, and despisedthe word of the Holy One of Israel. 

{5:25} Therefore is the anger ofthe LORD kindled against his people, and he hath stretched forth hishand against them, and hath smitten them: and the hills did tremble,and their carcases [were] torn in the midst of the streets. For allthis his anger is not turned away, but his hand [is] stretched outstill.   

{5:26} And he will lift up an ensign to the nations from far, andwill hiss unto them from the end of the earth: and, behold, they shallcome with speed swiftly: 

{5:27} None shall be weary nor stumble amongthem; none shall slumber nor sleep; neither shall the girdle of theirloins be loosed, nor the latchet of their shoes be broken: 

{5:28} Whosearrows [are] sharp, and all their bows bent, their horses' hoofs shallbe counted like flint, and their wheels like a whirlwind: 

{5:29} Theirroaring [shall be] like a lion, they shall roar like young lions: yea,they shall roar, and lay hold of the prey, and shall carry [it] awaysafe, and none shall deliver [it. ]

{5:30} And in that day they shallroar against them like the roaring of the sea: and if [one] look untothe land, behold darkness [and] sorrow, and the light is darkened inthe heavens thereof.   

{6:1} In the year that king Uzziah died I saw also the Lord sittingupon a throne, high and lifted up, and his train filled the temple.

{6:2} Above it stood the seraphims: each one had six wings; with twainhe covered his face, and with twain he covered his feet, and with twainhe did fly. 

{6:3} And one cried unto another, and said, Holy, holy,holy, [is] the LORD of hosts: the whole earth [is] full of his glory.

{6:4} And the posts of the door moved at the voice of him that cried,and the house was filled with smoke.   

{6:5} Then said I, Woe [is] me! for I am undone; because I [am] aman of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of uncleanlips: for mine eyes have seen the King, the LORD of hosts. 

{6:6} Thenflew one of the seraphims unto me, having a live coal in his hand,[which] he had taken with the tongs from off the altar: 

{6:7} And helaid [it] upon my mouth, and said, Lo, this hath touched thy lips; andthine iniquity is taken away, and thy sin purged. 

{6:8} Also I heardthe voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I send, and who will go forus? Then said I, Here [am] I; send me.   

{6:9} And he said, Go, and tell this people, Hear ye indeed, butunderstand not; and see ye indeed, but perceive not. 

{6:10} Make theheart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut theireyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, andunderstand with their heart, and convert, and be healed. 

{6:11} Thensaid I, Lord, how long? And he answered, Until the cities be wastedwithout inhabitant, and the houses without man, and the land be utterlydesolate, 

{6:12} And the LORD have removed men far away, and [there be]a great forsaking in the midst of the land.   

{6:13} But yet in it [shall be] a tenth, and [it] shall return, andshall be eaten: as a teil tree, and as an oak, whose substance is inthem, when they cast [their leaves: so] the holy seed [shall be] thesubstance thereof.   

{7:1} And it came to pass in the days of Ahaz the son of Jotham, theson of Uzziah, king of Judah, [that] Rezin the king of Syria, and Pekahthe son of Remaliah, king of Israel, went up toward Jerusalem to waragainst it, but could not prevail against it. 

{7:2} And it was told thehouse of David, saying, Syria is confederate with Ephraim. And hisheart was moved, and the heart of his people, as the trees of the woodare moved with the wind. 

{7:3} Then said the LORD unto Isaiah, Go forthnow to meet Ahaz, thou, and Shear-jashub thy son, at the end of theconduit of the upper pool in the highway of the fuller's field; 

{7:4}And say unto him, Take heed, and be quiet; fear not, neither befainthearted for the two tails of these smoking firebrands, for thefierce anger of Rezin with Syria, and of the son of Remaliah. 

{7:5}Because Syria, Ephraim, and the son of Remaliah, have taken evilcounsel against thee, saying, 

{7:6} Let us go up against Judah, and vexit, and let us make a breach therein for us, and set a king in themidst of it, [even] the son of Tabeal: 

{7:7} Thus saith the Lord GOD,It shall not stand, neither shall it come to pass. 

{7:8} For the headof Syria [is] Damascus, and the head of Damascus [is] Rezin; and withinthreescore and five years shall Ephraim be broken, that it be not apeople. 

{7:9} And the head of Ephraim [is] Samaria, and the head ofSamaria [is] Remaliah's son. If ye will not believe, surely ye shallnot be established.   

{7:10} Moreover the LORD spake again unto Ahaz, saying, 

{7:11} Askthee a sign of the LORD thy God; ask it either in the depth, or in theheight above. 

{7:12} But Ahaz said, I will not ask, neither will Itempt the LORD. 

{7:13} And he said, Hear ye now, O house of David; [Isit] a small thing for you to weary men, but will ye weary my God also?

{7:14} Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign; Behold, avirgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his nameImmanuel. 

{7:15} Butter and honey shall he eat, that he may know torefuse the evil, and choose the good. 

{7:16} For before the child shallknow to refuse the evil, and choose the good, the land that thouabhorrest shall be forsaken of both her kings.   

{7:17} The LORD shall bring upon thee, and upon thy people, and uponthy father's house, days that have not come, from the day that Ephraimdeparted from Judah; [even] the king of Assyria. 

{7:18} And it shallcome to pass in that day, [that] the LORD shall hiss for the fly that[is] in the uttermost part of the rivers of Egypt, and for the bee that[is] in the land of Assyria. 

{7:19} And they shall come, and shall restall of them in the desolate valleys, and in the holes of the rocks, andupon all thorns, and upon all bushes. 

{7:20} In the same day shall theLord shave with a razor that is hired, [namely,] by them beyond theriver, by the king of Assyria, the head, and the hair of the feet: andit shall also consume the beard. 

{7:21} And it shall come to pass inthat day, [that] a man shall nourish a young cow, and two sheep; 

{7:22}And it shall come to pass, for the abundance of milk [that] they shallgive he shall eat butter: for butter and honey shall every one eat thatis left in the land. 

{7:23} And it shall come to pass in that day,[that] every place shall be, where there were a thousand vines at athousand silverlings, it shall [even] be for briers and thorns. 

{7:24}With arrows and with bows shall [men] come thither; because all theland shall become briers and thorns. 

{7:25} And [on] all hills thatshall be digged with the mattock, there shall not come thither the fearof briers and thorns: but it shall be for the sending forth of oxen,and for the treading of lesser cattle.   

{8:1} Moreover the LORD said unto me, Take thee a great roll, andwrite in it with a man's pen concerning Maher-shalal-hash-baz. 

{8:2}And I took unto me faithful witnesses to record, Uriah the priest, andZechariah the son of Jeberechiah. 

{8:3} And I went unto the prophetess;and she conceived, and bare a son. Then said the LORD to me, Call hisname Maher-shalal-hash-baz. 

{8:4} For before the child shall haveknowledge to cry, My father, and my mother, the riches of Damascus andthe spoil of Samaria shall be taken away before the king of Assyria.   

{8:5} The LORD spake also unto me again, saying, 

{8:6} Forasmuch asthis people refuseth the waters of Shiloah that go softly, and rejoicein Rezin and Remaliah's son; 

{8:7} Now therefore, behold, the Lordbringeth up upon them the waters of the river, strong and many, [even]the king of Assyria, and all his glory: and he shall come up over allhis channels, and go over all his banks: 

{8:8} And he shall passthrough Judah; he shall overflow and go over, he shall reach [even] tothe neck; and the stretching out of his wings shall fill the breadth ofthy land, O Immanuel.   

{8:9} Associate yourselves, O ye people, and ye shall be broken inpieces; and give ear, all ye of far countries: gird yourselves, and yeshall be broken in pieces; gird yourselves, and ye shall be broken inpieces. 

{8:10} Take counsel together, and it shall come to nought;speak the word, and it shall not stand: for God [is] with us.   

{8:11} For the LORD spake thus to me with a strong hand, andinstructed me that I should not walk in the way of this people, saying,

{8:12} Say ye not, A confederacy, to all [them to] whom this peopleshall say, A confederacy; neither fear ye their fear, nor be afraid.

{8:13} Sanctify the LORD of hosts himself; and [let] him [be] yourfear, and [let] him [be] your dread. 

{8:14} And he shall be for asanctuary; but for a stone of stumbling and for a rock of offence toboth the houses of Israel, for a gin and for a snare to the inhabitantsof Jerusalem. 

{8:15} And many among them shall stumble, and fall, andbe broken, and be snared, and be taken. 

{8:16} Bind up the testimony,seal the law among my disciples. 

{8:17} And I will wait upon the LORD,that hideth his face from the house of Jacob, and I will look for him.

{8:18} Behold, I and the children whom the LORD hath given me [are] forsigns and for wonders in Israel from the LORD of hosts, which dwellethin mount Zion.   

{8:19} And when they shall say unto you, Seek unto them that havefamiliar spirits, and unto wizards that peep, and that mutter: shouldnot a people seek unto their God? for the living to the dead? 

{8:20} Tothe law and to the testimony: if they speak not according to this word,[it is] because [there is] no light in them. 

{8:21} And they shall passthrough it, hardly bestead and hungry: and it shall come to pass, thatwhen they shall be hungry, they shall fret themselves, and curse theirking and their God, and look upward. 

{8:22} And they shall look untothe earth; and behold trouble and darkness, dimness of anguish; and[they shall be] driven to darkness.   

{9:1} Nevertheless the dimness [shall] not [be] such as [was] in hervexation, when at the first he lightly afflicted the land of Zebulunand the land of Naphtali, and afterward did more grievously afflict[her by] the way of the sea, beyond Jordan, in Galilee of the nations.

{9:2} The people that walked in darkness have seen a great light: theythat dwell in the land of the shadow of death, upon them hath the lightshined. 

{9:3} Thou hast multiplied the nation, [and] not increased thejoy: they joy before thee according to the joy in harvest, [and] as[men] rejoice when they divide the spoil. 

{9:4} For thou hast brokenthe yoke of his burden, and the staff of his shoulder, the rod of hisoppressor, as in the day of Midian. 

{9:5} For every battle of thewarrior [is] with confused noise, and garments rolled in blood; but[this] shall be with burning [and] fuel of fire. 

{9:6} For unto us achild is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be uponhis shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, Themighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace. 

{9:7} Of theincrease of [his] government and peace [there shall be] no end, uponthe throne of David, and upon his kingdom, to order it, and toestablish it with judgment and with justice from henceforth even forever. The zeal of the LORD of hosts will perform this.   

{9:8} The Lord sent a word into Jacob, and it hath lighted uponIsrael. 

{9:9} And all the people shall know, [even] Ephraim and theinhabitant of Samaria, that say in the pride and stoutness of heart,

{9:10} The bricks are fallen down, but we will build with hewn stones:the sycomores are cut down, but we will change [them into] cedars.

{9:11} Therefore the LORD shall set up the adversaries of Rezin againsthim, and join his enemies together; 

{9:12} The Syrians before, and thePhilistines behind; and they shall devour Israel with open mouth. Forall this his anger is not turned away, but his hand [is] stretched outstill.   

{9:13} For the people turneth not unto him that smiteth them,neither do they seek the LORD of hosts. 

{9:14} Therefore the LORD willcut off from Israel head and tail, branch and rush, in one day. 

{9:15}The ancient and honourable, he [is] the head; and the prophet thatteacheth lies, he [is] the tail. 

{9:16} For the leaders of this peoplecause [them] to err; and [they that are] led of them [are] destroyed.

{9:17} Therefore the Lord shall have no joy in their young men, neithershall have mercy on their fatherless and widows: for every one is anhypocrite and an evildoer, and every mouth speaketh folly. For all thishis anger is not turned away, but his hand [is] stretched out still.   

{9:18} For wickedness burneth as the fire: it shall devour thebriers and thorns, and shall kindle in the thickets of the forest, andthey shall mount up [like] the lifting up of smoke. 

{9:19} Through thewrath of the LORD of hosts is the land darkened, and the people shallbe as the fuel of the fire: no man shall spare his brother. 

{9:20} Andhe shall snatch on the right hand, and be hungry; and he shall eat onthe left hand, and they shall not be satisfied: they shall eat everyman the flesh of his own arm: 

{9:21} Manasseh, Ephraim; and Ephraim,Manasseh: [and] they together [shall be] against Judah. For all thishis anger is not turned away, but his hand [is] stretched out still.   

{10:1} Woe unto them that decree unrighteous decrees, and that writegrievousness [which] they have prescribed; 

{10:2} To turn aside theneedy from judgment, and to take away the right from the poor of mypeople, that widows may be their prey, and [that] they may rob thefatherless! 

{10:3} And what will ye do in the day of visitation, and inthe desolation [which] shall come from far? to whom will ye flee forhelp? and where will ye leave your glory? 

{10:4} Without me they shallbow down under the prisoners, and they shall fall under the slain. Forall this his anger is not turned away, but his hand [is] stretched outstill.   

{10:5} O Assyrian, the rod of mine anger, and the staff in theirhand is mine indignation. 

{10:6} I will send him against anhypocritical nation, and against the people of my wrath will I give hima charge, to take the spoil, and to take the prey, and to tread themdown like the mire of the streets. 

{10:7} Howbeit he meaneth not so,neither doth his heart think so; but [it is] in his heart to destroyand cut off nations not a few. 

{10:8} For he saith, [Are] not myprinces altogether kings? 

{10:9} [Is] not Calno as Carchemish? [is] notHamath as Arpad? [is] not Samaria as Damascus? 

{10:10} As my hand hathfound the kingdoms of the idols, and whose graven images did excel themof Jerusalem and of Samaria; 

{10:11} Shall I not, as I have done untoSamaria and her idols, so do to Jerusalem and her idols? 

{10:12}Wherefore it shall come to pass, [that] when the Lord hath performedhis whole work upon mount Zion and on Jerusalem, I will punish thefruit of the stout heart of the king of Assyria, and the glory of hishigh looks. 

{10:13} For he saith, By the strength of my hand I havedone [it,] and by my wisdom; for I am prudent: and I have removed thebounds of the people, and have robbed their treasures, and I have putdown the inhabitants like a valiant [man: ]

{10:14} And my hand hathfound as a nest the riches of the people: and as one gathereth eggs[that are] left, have I gathered all the earth; and there was none thatmoved the wing, or opened the mouth, or peeped. 

{10:15} Shall the axeboast itself against him that heweth therewith? [or] shall the sawmagnify itself against him that shaketh it? as if the rod should shake[itself] against them that lift it up, [or] as if the staff should liftup [itself, as if it were] no wood. 

{10:16} Therefore shall the Lord,the Lord of hosts, send among his fat ones leanness; and under hisglory he shall kindle a burning like the burning of a fire. 

{10:17} Andthe light of Israel shall be for a fire, and his Holy One for a flame:and it shall burn and devour his thorns and his briers in one day;

{10:18} And shall consume the glory of his forest, and of his fruitfulfield, both soul and body: and they shall be as when a standardbearerfainteth. 

{10:19} And the rest of the trees of his forest shall be few,that a child may write them.   

{10:20} And it shall come to pass in that day, [that] the remnant ofIsrael, and such as are escaped of the house of Jacob, shall no moreagain stay upon him that smote them; but shall stay upon the LORD, theHoly One of Israel, in truth. 

{10:21} The remnant shall return, [even]the remnant of Jacob, unto the mighty God. 

{10:22} For though thypeople Israel be as the sand of the sea, [yet] a remnant of them shallreturn: the consumption decreed shall overflow with righteousness.

{10:23} For the Lord GOD of hosts shall make a consumption, evendetermined, in the midst of all the land.   

{10:24} Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD of hosts, O my people thatdwellest in Zion, be not afraid of the Assyrian: he shall smite theewith a rod, and shall lift up his staff against thee, after the mannerof Egypt. 

{10:25} For yet a very little while, and the indignationshall cease, and mine anger in their destruction. 

{10:26} And the LORDof hosts shall stir up a scourge for him according to the slaughter ofMidian at the rock of Oreb: and [as] his rod [was] upon the sea, soshall he lift it up after the manner of Egypt. 

{10:27} And it shallcome to pass in that day, [that] his burden shall be taken away fromoff thy shoulder, and his yoke from off thy neck, and the yoke shall bedestroyed because of the anointing. 

{10:28} He is come to Aiath, he ispassed to Migron; at Michmash he hath laid up his carriages: 

{10:29}They are gone over the passage: they have taken up their lodging atGeba; Ramah is afraid; Gibeah of Saul is fled. 

{10:30} Lift up thyvoice, O daughter of Gallim: cause it to be heard unto Laish, O poorAnathoth. 

{10:31} Madmenah is removed; the inhabitants of Gebim gatherthemselves to flee. 

{10:32} As yet shall he remain at Nob that day: heshall shake his hand [against] the mount of the daughter of Zion, thehill of Jerusalem. 

{10:33} Behold, the Lord, the LORD of hosts, shalllop the bough with terror: and the high ones of stature [shall be] hewndown, and the haughty shall be humbled. 

{10:34} And he shall cut downthe thickets of the forest with iron, and Lebanon shall fall by amighty one.   

{11:1} And there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse,and a Branch shall grow out of his roots: 

{11:2} And the spirit of theLORD shall rest upon him, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, thespirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and of the fear ofthe LORD; 

{11:3} And shall make him of quick understanding in the fearof the LORD: and he shall not judge after the sight of his eyes,neither reprove after the hearing of his ears: 

{11:4} But withrighteousness shall he judge the poor, and reprove with equity for themeek of the earth: and he shall smite the earth with the rod of hismouth, and with the breath of his lips shall he slay the wicked. 

{11:5}And righteousness shall be the girdle of his loins, and faithfulnessthe girdle of his reins. 

{11:6} The wolf also shall dwell with thelamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the kid; and the calf and theyoung lion and the fatling together; and a little child shall leadthem. 

{11:7} And the cow and the bear shall feed; their young onesshall lie down together: and the lion shall eat straw like the ox.

{11:8} And the sucking child shall play on the hole of the asp, and theweaned child shall put his hand on the cockatrice' den. 

{11:9} Theyshall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain: for the earth shallbe full of the knowledge of the LORD, as the waters cover the sea.   

{11:10} And in that day there shall be a root of Jesse, which shallstand for an ensign of the people; to it shall the Gentiles seek: andhis rest shall be glorious. 

{11:11} And it shall come to pass in thatday, [that] the Lord shall set his hand again the second time torecover the remnant of his people, which shall be left, from Assyria,and from Egypt, and from Pathros, and from Cush, and from Elam, andfrom Shinar, and from Hamath, and from the islands of the sea. 

{11:12}And he shall set up an ensign for the nations, and shall assemble theoutcasts of Israel, and gather together the dispersed of Judah from thefour corners of the earth. 

{11:13} The envy also of Ephraim shalldepart, and the adversaries of Judah shall be cut off: Ephraim shallnot envy Judah, and Judah shall not vex Ephraim. 

{11:14} But they shallfly upon the shoulders of the Philistines toward the west; they shallspoil them of the east together: they shall lay their hand upon Edomand Moab; and the children of Ammon shall obey them. 

{11:15} And theLORD shall utterly destroy the tongue of the Egyptian sea; and with hismighty wind shall he shake his hand over the river, and shall smite itin the seven streams, and make [men] go over dryshod. 

{11:16} And thereshall be an highway for the remnant of his people, which shall be left,from Assyria; like as it was to Israel in the day that he came up outof the land of Egypt.   

{12:1} And in that day thou shalt say, O LORD, I will praise thee:though thou wast angry with me, thine anger is turned away, and thoucomfortedst me. 

{12:2} Behold, God [is] my salvation; I will trust, andnot be afraid: for the LORD JEHOVAH [is] my strength and [my] song; healso is become my salvation. 

{12:3} Therefore with joy shall ye drawwater out of the wells of salvation. 

{12:4} And in that day shall yesay, Praise the LORD, call upon his name, declare his doings among thepeople, make mention that his name is exalted. 

{12:5} Sing unto theLORD; for he hath done excellent things: this [is] known in all theearth. 

{12:6} Cry out and shout, thou inhabitant of Zion: for great[is] the Holy One of Israel in the midst of thee.   

{13:1} The burden of Babylon, which Isaiah the son of Amoz did see.

{13:2} Lift ye up a banner upon the high mountain, exalt the voice untothem, shake the hand, that they may go into the gates of the nobles.

{13:3} I have commanded my sanctified ones, I have also called mymighty ones for mine anger, [even] them that rejoice in my highness.

{13:4} The noise of a multitude in the mountains, like as of a greatpeople; a tumultuous noise of the kingdoms of nations gatheredtogether: the LORD of hosts mustereth the host of the battle. 

{13:5}They come from a far country, from the end of heaven, [even] the LORD,and the weapons of his indignation, to destroy the whole land.   

{13:6} Howl ye; for the day of the LORD [is] at hand; it shall comeas a destruction from the Almighty. 

{13:7} Therefore shall all hands befaint, and every man's heart shall melt: 

{13:8} And they shall beafraid: pangs and sorrows shall take hold of them; they shall be inpain as a woman that travaileth: they shall be amazed one at another;their faces [shall be as] flames. 

{13:9} Behold, the day of the LORDcometh, cruel both with wrath and fierce anger, to lay the landdesolate: and he shall destroy the sinners thereof out of it. 

{13:10}For the stars of heaven and the constellations thereof shall not givetheir light: the sun shall be darkened in his going forth, and the moonshall not cause her light to shine. 

{13:11} And I will punish the worldfor [their] evil, and the wicked for their iniquity; and I will causethe arrogancy of the proud to cease, and will lay low the haughtinessof the terrible. 

{13:12} I will make a man more precious than finegold; even a man than the golden wedge of Ophir. 

{13:13} Therefore Iwill shake the heavens, and the earth shall remove out of her place, inthe wrath of the LORD of hosts, and in the day of his fierce anger.

{13:14} And it shall be as the chased roe, and as a sheep that no mantaketh up: they shall every man turn to his own people, and flee everyone into his own land. 

{13:15} Every one that is found shall be thrustthrough; and every one that is joined [unto them] shall fall by thesword. 

{13:16} Their children also shall be dashed to pieces beforetheir eyes; their houses shall be spoiled, and their wives ravished.

{13:17} Behold, I will stir up the Medes against them, which shall notregard silver; and [as for] gold, they shall not delight in it. 

{13:18}[Their] bows also shall dash the young men to pieces; and they shallhave no pity on the fruit of the womb; their eye shall not sparechildren.   

{13:19} And Babylon, the glory of kingdoms, the beauty of theChaldees' excellency, shall be as when God overthrew Sodom andGomorrah. 

{13:20} It shall never be inhabited, neither shall it bedwelt in from generation to generation: neither shall the Arabian pitchtent there; neither shall the shepherds make their fold there. 

{13:21}But wild beasts of the desert shall lie there; and their houses shallbe full of doleful creatures; and owls shall dwell there, and satyrsshall dance there. 

{13:22} And the wild beasts of the islands shall cryin their desolate houses, and dragons in [their] pleasant palaces: andher time [is] near to come, and her days shall not be prolonged.   

{14:1} For the LORD will have mercy on Jacob, and will yet chooseIsrael, and set them in their own land: and the strangers shall bejoined with them, and they shall cleave to the house of Jacob. 

{14:2}And the people shall take them, and bring them to their place: and thehouse of Israel shall possess them in the land of the LORD for servantsand handmaids: and they shall take them captives, whose captives theywere; and they shall rule over their oppressors. 

{14:3} And it shallcome to pass in the day that the LORD shall give thee rest from thysorrow, and from thy fear, and from the hard bondage wherein thou wastmade to serve,   

{14:4} That thou shalt take up this proverb against the king ofBabylon, and say, How hath the oppressor ceased! the golden cityceased! 

{14:5} The LORD hath broken the staff of the wicked, [and] thesceptre of the rulers. 

{14:6} He who smote the people in wrath with acontinual stroke, he that ruled the nations in anger, is persecuted,[and] none hindereth. 

{14:7} The whole earth is at rest, [and] isquiet: they break forth into singing. 

{14:8} Yea, the fir trees rejoiceat thee, [and] the cedars of Lebanon, [saying,] Since thou art laiddown, no feller is come up against us. 

{14:9} Hell from beneath ismoved for thee to meet [thee] at thy coming: it stirreth up the deadfor thee, [even] all the chief ones of the earth; it hath raised upfrom their thrones all the kings of the nations. 

{14:10} All they shallspeak and say unto thee, Art thou also become weak as we? art thoubecome like unto us? 

{14:11} Thy pomp is brought down to the grave,[and] the noise of thy viols: the worm is spread under thee, and theworms cover thee. 

{14:12} How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer,son of the morning! [how] art thou cut down to the ground, which didstweaken the nations! 

{14:13} For thou hast said in thine heart, I willascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God: Iwill sit also upon the mount of the congregation, in the sides of thenorth: 

{14:14} I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will belike the most High. 

{14:15} Yet thou shalt be brought down to hell, tothe sides of the pit. 

{14:16} They that see thee shall narrowly lookupon thee, [and] consider thee, [saying, Is] this the man that made theearth to tremble, that did shake kingdoms; 

{14:17} [That] made theworld as a wilderness, and destroyed the cities thereof; [that] openednot the house of his prisoners? 

{14:18} All the kings of the nations,[even] all of them, lie in glory, every one in his own house. 

{14:19}But thou art cast out of thy grave like an abominable branch, [and as]the raiment of those that are slain, thrust through with a sword, thatgo down to the stones of the pit; as a carcase trodden under feet.

{14:20} Thou shalt not be joined with them in burial, because thou hastdestroyed thy land, [and] slain thy people: the seed of evildoers shallnever be renowned. 

{14:21} Prepare slaughter for his children for theiniquity of their fathers; that they do not rise, nor possess the land,nor fill the face of the world with cities. 

{14:22} For I will rise upagainst them, saith the LORD of hosts, and cut off from Babylon thename, and remnant, and son, and nephew, saith the LORD. 

{14:23} I willalso make it a possession for the bittern, and pools of water: and Iwill sweep it with the besom of destruction, saith the LORD of hosts.   

{14:24} The LORD of hosts hath sworn, saying, Surely as I havethought, so shall it come to pass; and as I have purposed, [so] shallit stand: 

{14:25} That I will break the Assyrian in my land, and uponmy mountains tread him under foot: then shall his yoke depart from offthem, and his burden depart from off their shoulders. 

{14:26} This [is]the purpose that is purposed upon the whole earth: and this [is] thehand that is stretched out upon all the nations. 

{14:27} For the LORDof hosts hath purposed, and who shall disannul [it?] and his hand [is]stretched out, and who shall turn it back? 

{14:28} In the year thatking Ahaz died was this burden.   

{14:29} Rejoice not thou, whole Palestina, because the rod of himthat smote thee is broken: for out of the serpent's root shall comeforth a cockatrice, and his fruit [shall be] a fiery flying serpent.

{14:30} And the firstborn of the poor shall feed, and the needy shalllie down in safety: and I will kill thy root with famine, and he shallslay thy remnant. 

{14:31} Howl, O gate; cry, O city; thou, wholePalestina, [art] dissolved: for there shall come from the north asmoke, and none [shall be] alone in his appointed times. 

{14:32} Whatshall [one] then answer the messengers of the nation? That the LORDhath founded Zion, and the poor of his people shall trust in it.   

{15:1} The burden of Moab. Because in the night Ar of Moab is laidwaste, [and] brought to silence; because in the night Kir of Moab islaid waste, [and] brought to silence; 

{15:2} He is gone up to Bajith,and to Dibon, the high places, to weep: Moab shall howl over Nebo, andover Medeba: on all their heads [shall be] baldness, [and] every beardcut off. 

{15:3} In their streets they shall gird themselves withsackcloth: on the tops of their houses, and in their streets, every oneshall howl, weeping abundantly. 

{15:4} And Heshbon shall cry, andElealeh: their voice shall be heard [even] unto Jahaz: therefore thearmed soldiers of Moab shall cry out; his life shall be grievous untohim. 

{15:5} My heart shall cry out for Moab; his fugitives [shall flee]unto Zoar, an heifer of three years old: for by the mounting up ofLuhith with weeping shall they go it up; for in the way of Horonaimthey shall raise up a cry of destruction. 

{15:6} For the waters ofNimrim shall be desolate: for the hay is withered away, the grassfaileth, there is no green thing. 

{15:7} Therefore the abundance theyhave gotten, and that which they have laid up, shall they carry away tothe brook of the willows. 

{15:8} For the cry is gone round about theborders of Moab; the howling thereof unto Eglaim, and the howlingthereof unto Beer-elim. 

{15:9} For the waters of Dimon shall be full ofblood: for I will bring more upon Dimon, lions upon him that escapethof Moab, and upon the remnant of the land.   

{16:1} Send ye the lamb to the ruler of the land from Sela to thewilderness, unto the mount of the daughter of Zion. 

{16:2} For it shallbe, [that,] as a wandering bird cast out of the nest, so the daughtersof Moab shall be at the fords of Arnon. 

{16:3} Take counsel, executejudgment; make thy shadow as the night in the midst of the noonday;hide the outcasts; bewray not him that wandereth. 

{16:4} Let mineoutcasts dwell with thee, Moab; be thou a covert to them from the faceof the spoiler: for the extortioner is at an end, the spoiler ceaseth,the oppressors are consumed out of the land. 

{16:5} And in mercy shallthe throne be established: and he shall sit upon it in truth in thetabernacle of David, judging, and seeking judgment, and hastingrighteousness.   

{16:6} We have heard of the pride of Moab; [he is] very proud:[even] of his haughtiness, and his pride, and his wrath: [but] his lies[shall] not [be] so. 

{16:7} Therefore shall Moab howl for Moab, everyone shall howl: for the foundations of Kir-hareseth shall ye mourn;surely [they are] stricken. 

{16:8} For the fields of Heshbon languish,[and] the vine of Sibmah: the lords of the heathen have broken down theprincipal plants thereof, they are come [even] unto Jazer, theywandered [through] the wilderness: her branches are stretched out, theyare gone over the sea.   

{16:9} Therefore I will bewail with the weeping of Jazer the vine ofSibmah: I will water thee with my tears, O Heshbon, and Elealeh: forthe shouting for thy summer fruits and for thy harvest is fallen.

{16:10} And gladness is taken away, and joy out of the plentiful field;and in the vineyards there shall be no singing, neither shall there beshouting: the treaders shall tread out no wine in [their] presses; Ihave made [their vintage] shouting to cease. 

{16:11} Wherefore mybowels shall sound like an harp for Moab, and mine inward parts forKir-haresh.   

{16:12} And it shall come to pass, when it is seen that Moab isweary on the high place, that he shall come to his sanctuary to pray;but he shall not prevail. 

{16:13} This [is] the word that the LORD hathspoken concerning Moab since that time. 

{16:14} But now the LORD hathspoken, saying, Within three years, as the years of an hireling, andthe glory of Moab shall be contemned, with all that great multitude;and the remnant [shall be] very small [and] feeble.   

{17:1} The burden of Damascus. Behold, Damascus is taken away from[being] a city, and it shall be a ruinous heap. 

{17:2} The cities ofAroer [are] forsaken: they shall be for flocks, which shall lie down,and none shall make [them] afraid. 

{17:3} The fortress also shall ceasefrom Ephraim, and the kingdom from Damascus, and the remnant of Syria:they shall be as the glory of the children of Israel, saith the LORD ofhosts. 

{17:4} And in that day it shall come to pass, [that] the gloryof Jacob shall be made thin, and the fatness of his flesh shall waxlean. 

{17:5} And it shall be as when the harvestman gathereth the corn,and reapeth the ears with his arm; and it shall be as he that gatherethears in the valley of Rephaim.   

{17:6} Yet gleaning grapes shall be left in it, as the shaking of anolive tree, two [or] three berries in the top of the uppermost bough,four [or] five in the outmost fruitful branches thereof, saith the LORDGod of Israel. 

{17:7} At that day shall a man look to his Maker, andhis eyes shall have respect to the Holy One of Israel. 

{17:8} And heshall not look to the altars, the work of his hands, neither shallrespect [that] which his fingers have made, either the groves, or theimages.   

{17:9} In that day shall his strong cities be as a forsaken bough,and an uppermost branch, which they left because of the children ofIsrael: and there shall be desolation. 

{17:10} Because thou hastforgotten the God of thy salvation, and hast not been mindful of therock of thy strength, therefore shalt thou plant pleasant plants, andshalt set it with strange slips: 

{17:11} In the day shalt thou make thyplant to grow, and in the morning shalt thou make thy seed to flourish:[but] the harvest [shall be] a heap in the day of grief and ofdesperate sorrow.   

{17:12} Woe to the multitude of many people, [which] make a noiselike the noise of the seas; and to the rushing of nations, [that] makea rushing like the rushing of mighty waters! 

{17:13} The nations shallrush like the rushing of many waters: but [God] shall rebuke them, andthey shall flee far off, and shall be chased as the chaff of themountains before the wind, and like a rolling thing before thewhirlwind. 

{17:14} And behold at eveningtide trouble; [and] before themorning he [is] not. This [is] the portion of them that spoil us, andthe lot of them that rob us.   

{18:1} Woe to the land shadowing with wings, which [is] beyond therivers of Ethiopia: 

{18:2} That sendeth ambassadors by the sea, even invessels of bulrushes upon the waters, [saying,] Go, ye swiftmessengers, to a nation scattered and peeled, to a people terrible fromtheir beginning hitherto; a nation meted out and trodden down, whoseland the rivers have spoiled! 

{18:3} All ye inhabitants of the world,and dwellers on the earth, see ye, when he lifteth up an ensign on themountains; and when he bloweth a trumpet, hear ye. 

{18:4} For so theLORD said unto me, I will take my rest, and I will consider in mydwelling place like a clear heat upon herbs, [and] like a cloud of dewin the heat of harvest. 

{18:5} For afore the harvest, when the bud isperfect, and the sour grape is ripening in the flower, he shall bothcut off the sprigs with pruninghooks, and take away [and] cut down thebranches. 

{18:6} They shall be left together unto the fowls of themountains, and to the beasts of the earth: and the fowls shall summerupon them, and all the beasts of the earth shall winter upon them.   

{18:7} In that time shall the present be brought unto the LORD ofhosts of a people scattered and peeled, and from a people terrible fromtheir beginning hitherto; a nation meted out and trodden under foot,whose land the rivers have spoiled, to the place of the name of theLORD of hosts, the mount Zion.   

{19:1} The burden of Egypt. Behold, the LORD rideth upon a swiftcloud, and shall come into Egypt: and the idols of Egypt shall be movedat his presence, and the heart of Egypt shall melt in the midst of it.

{19:2} And I will set the Egyptians against the Egyptians: and theyshall fight every one against his brother, and every one against hisneighbour; city against city, [and] kingdom against kingdom. 

{19:3} Andthe spirit of Egypt shall fail in the midst thereof; and I will destroythe counsel thereof: and they shall seek to the idols, and to thecharmers, and to them that have familiar spirits, and to the wizards.

{19:4} And the Egyptians will I give over into the hand of a cruellord; and a fierce king shall rule over them, saith the Lord, the LORDof hosts. 

{19:5} And the waters shall fail from the sea, and the rivershall be wasted and dried up. 

{19:6} And they shall turn the rivers faraway; [and] the brooks of defence shall be emptied and dried up: thereeds and flags shall wither. 

{19:7} The paper reeds by the brooks, bythe mouth of the brooks, and every thing sown by the brooks, shallwither, be driven away, and be no [more. ]

{19:8} The fishers also shallmourn, and all they that cast angle into the brooks shall lament, andthey that spread nets upon the waters shall languish. 

{19:9} Moreoverthey that work in fine flax, and they that weave networks, shall beconfounded. 

{19:10} And they shall be broken in the purposes thereof,all that make sluices [and] ponds for fish.   

{19:11} Surely the princes of Zoan [are] fools, the counsel of thewise counsellors of Pharaoh is become brutish: how say ye unto Pharaoh,I [am] the son of the wise, the son of ancient kings? 

{19:12} Where[are] they? where [are] thy wise [men?] and let them tell thee now, andlet them know what the LORD of hosts hath purposed upon Egypt. 

{19:13}The princes of Zoan are become fools, the princes of Noph are deceived;they have also seduced Egypt, [even they that are] the stay of thetribes thereof. 

{19:14} The LORD hath mingled a perverse spirit in themidst thereof: and they have caused Egypt to err in every work thereof,as a drunken [man] staggereth in his vomit. 

{19:15} Neither shall therebe [any] work for Egypt, which the head or tail, branch or rush, maydo. 

{19:16} In that day shall Egypt be like unto women: and it shall beafraid and fear because of the shaking of the hand of the LORD ofhosts, which he shaketh over it. 

{19:17} And the land of Judah shall bea terror unto Egypt, every one that maketh mention thereof shall beafraid in himself, because of the counsel of the LORD of hosts, whichhe hath determined against it.   

{19:18} In that day shall five cities in the land of Egypt speak thelanguage of Canaan, and swear to the LORD of hosts; one shall becalled, The city of destruction. 

{19:19} In that day shall there be analtar to the LORD in the midst of the land of Egypt, and a pillar atthe border thereof to the LORD. 

{19:20} And it shall be for a sign andfor a witness unto the LORD of hosts in the land of Egypt: for theyshall cry unto the LORD because of the oppressors, and he shall sendthem a saviour, and a great one, and he shall deliver them. 

{19:21} Andthe LORD shall be known to Egypt, and the Egyptians shall know the LORDin that day, and shall do sacrifice and oblation; yea, they shall vow avow unto the LORD, and perform [it. ]

{19:22} And the LORD shall smiteEgypt: he shall smite and heal [it:] and they shall return [even] tothe LORD, and he shall be intreated of them, and shall heal them.   

{19:23} In that day shall there be a highway out of Egypt toAssyria, and the Assyrian shall come into Egypt, and the Egyptian intoAssyria, and the Egyptians shall serve with the Assyrians. 

{19:24} Inthat day shall Israel be the third with Egypt and with Assyria, [even]a blessing in the midst of the land: 

{19:25} Whom the LORD of hostsshall bless, saying, Blessed [be] Egypt my people, and Assyria the workof my hands, and Israel mine inheritance.   

{20:1} In the year that Tartan came unto Ashdod, (when Sargon theking of Assyria sent him,) and fought against Ashdod, and took it;

{20:2} At the same time spake the LORD by Isaiah the son of Amoz,saying, Go and loose the sackcloth from off thy loins, and put off thyshoe from thy foot. And he did so, walking naked and barefoot. 

{20:3}And the LORD said, Like as my servant Isaiah hath walked naked andbarefoot three years [for] a sign and wonder upon Egypt and uponEthiopia; 

{20:4} So shall the king of Assyria lead away the Egyptiansprisoners, and the Ethiopians captives, young and old, naked andbarefoot, even with [their] buttocks uncovered, to the shame of Egypt.

{20:5} And they shall be afraid and ashamed of Ethiopia theirexpectation, and of Egypt their glory. 

{20:6} And the inhabitant ofthis isle shall say in that day, Behold, such [is] our expectation,whither we flee for help to be delivered from the king of Assyria: andhow shall we escape?   

{21:1} The burden of the desert of the sea. As whirlwinds in thesouth pass through; [so] it cometh from the desert, from a terribleland. 

{21:2} A grievous vision is declared unto me; the treacherousdealer dealeth treacherously, and the spoiler spoileth. Go up, O Elam:besiege, O Media; all the sighing thereof have I made to cease. 

{21:3}Therefore are my loins filled with pain: pangs have taken hold upon me,as the pangs of a woman that travaileth: I was bowed down at thehearing [of it;] I was dismayed at the seeing [of it. ]

{21:4} My heartpanted, fearfulness affrighted me: the night of my pleasure hath heturned into fear unto me. 

{21:5} Prepare the table, watch in thewatchtower, eat, drink: arise, ye princes, [and] anoint the shield.

{21:6} For thus hath the Lord said unto me, Go, set a watchman, let himdeclare what he seeth. 

{21:7} And he saw a chariot [with] a couple ofhorsemen, a chariot of asses, [and] a chariot of camels; and hehearkened diligently with much heed: 

{21:8} And he cried, A lion: Mylord, I stand continually upon the watchtower in the daytime, and I amset in my ward whole nights: 

{21:9} And, behold, here cometh a chariotof men, [with] a couple of horsemen. And he answered and said, Babylonis fallen, is fallen; and all the graven images of her gods he hathbroken unto the ground. 

{21:10} O my threshing, and the corn of myfloor: that which I have heard of the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel,have I declared unto you.   

{21:11} The burden of Dumah. He calleth to me out of Seir, Watchman,what of the night? Watchman, what of the night? 

{21:12} The watchmansaid, The morning cometh, and also the night: if ye will enquire,enquire ye: return, come.   

{21:13} The burden upon Arabia. In the forest in Arabia shall yelodge, O ye travelling companies of Dedanim. 

{21:14} The inhabitants ofthe land of Tema brought water to him that was thirsty, they preventedwith their bread him that fled. 

{21:15} For they fled from the swords,from the drawn sword, and from the bent bow, and from the grievousnessof war. 

{21:16} For thus hath the Lord said unto me, Within a year,according to the years of an hireling, and all the glory of Kedar shallfail: 

{21:17} And the residue of the number of archers, the mighty menof the children of Kedar, shall be diminished: for the LORD God ofIsrael hath spoken [it.]   

{22:1} The burden of the valley of vision. What aileth thee now,that thou art wholly gone up to the housetops? 

{22:2} Thou that artfull of stirs, a tumultuous city, a joyous city: thy slain [men are]not slain with the sword, nor dead in battle. 

{22:3} All thy rulers arefled together, they are bound by the archers: all that are found inthee are bound together, [which] have fled from far. 

{22:4} Thereforesaid I, Look away from me; I will weep bitterly, labour not to comfortme, because of the spoiling of the daughter of my people. 

{22:5} For[it is] a day of trouble, and of treading down, and of perplexity bythe Lord GOD of hosts in the valley of vision, breaking down the walls,and of crying to the mountains. 

{22:6} And Elam bare the quiver withchariots of men [and] horsemen, and Kir uncovered the shield. 

{22:7}And it shall come to pass, [that] thy choicest valleys shall be full ofchariots, and the horsemen shall set themselves in array at the gate.   

{22:8} And he discovered the covering of Judah, and thou didst lookin that day to the armour of the house of the forest. 

{22:9} Ye haveseen also the breaches of the city of David, that they are many: and yegathered together the waters of the lower pool. 

{22:10} And ye havenumbered the houses of Jerusalem, and the houses have ye broken down tofortify the wall. 

{22:11} Ye made also a ditch between the two wallsfor the water of the old pool: but ye have not looked unto the makerthereof, neither had respect unto him that fashioned it long ago.

{22:12} And in that day did the Lord GOD of hosts call to weeping, andto mourning, and to baldness, and to girding with sackcloth: 

{22:13}And behold joy and gladness, slaying oxen, and killing sheep, eatingflesh, and drinking wine: let us eat and drink; for to morrow we shalldie. 

{22:14} And it was revealed in mine ears by the LORD of hosts,Surely this iniquity shall not be purged from you till ye die, saiththe Lord GOD of hosts.   

{22:15} Thus saith the Lord GOD of hosts, Go, get thee unto thistreasurer, [even] unto Shebna, which [is] over the house, [and say,]

{22:16} What hast thou here? and whom hast thou here, that thou hasthewed thee out a sepulchre here, [as] he that heweth him out asepulchre on high, [and] that graveth an habitation for himself in arock? 

{22:17} Behold, the LORD will carry thee away with a mightycaptivity, and will surely cover thee. 

{22:18} He will surely violentlyturn and toss thee [like] a ball into a large country: there shalt thoudie, and there the chariots of thy glory [shall be] the shame of thylord's house. 

{22:19} And I will drive thee from thy station, and fromthy state shall he pull thee down.   

{22:20} And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will call myservant Eliakim the son of Hilkiah: 

{22:21} And I will clothe him withthy robe, and strengthen him with thy girdle, and I will commit thygovernment into his hand: and he shall be a father to the inhabitantsof Jerusalem, and to the house of Judah. 

{22:22} And the key of thehouse of David will I lay upon his shoulder; so he shall open, and noneshall shut; and he shall shut, and none shall open. 

{22:23} And I willfasten him as a nail in a sure place; and he shall be for a gloriousthrone to his father's house. 

{22:24} And they shall hang upon him allthe glory of his father's house, the offspring and the issue, allvessels of small quantity, from the vessels of cups, even to all thevessels of flagons. 

{22:25} In that day, saith the LORD of hosts, shallthe nail that is fastened in the sure place be removed, and be cutdown, and fall; and the burden that [was] upon it shall be cut off: forthe LORD hath spoken [it.]   

{23:1} The burden of Tyre. Howl, ye ships of Tarshish; for it islaid waste, so that there is no house, no entering in: from the land ofChittim it is revealed to them. 

{23:2} Be still, ye inhabitants of theisle; thou whom the merchants of Zidon, that pass over the sea, havereplenished. 

{23:3} And by great waters the seed of Sihor, the harvestof the river, [is] her revenue; and she is a mart of nations. 

{23:4} Bethou ashamed, O Zidon: for the sea hath spoken, [even] the strength ofthe sea, saying, I travail not, nor bring forth children, neither do Inourish up young men, [nor] bring up virgins. 

{23:5} As at the reportconcerning Egypt, [so] shall they be sorely pained at the report ofTyre. 

{23:6} Pass ye over to Tarshish; howl, ye inhabitants of theisle. 

{23:7} [Is] this your joyous [city,] whose antiquity [is] ofancient days? her own feet shall carry her afar off to sojourn. 

{23:8}Who hath taken this counsel against Tyre, the crowning [city,] whosemerchants [are] princes, whose traffickers [are] the honourable of theearth? 

{23:9} The LORD of hosts hath purposed it, to stain the pride ofall glory, [and] to bring into contempt all the honourable of theearth. 

{23:10} Pass through thy land as a river, O daughter ofTarshish: [there is] no more strength. 

{23:11} He stretched out hishand over the sea, he shook the kingdoms: the LORD hath given acommandment against the merchant [city,] to destroy the strong holdsthereof. 

{23:12} And he said, Thou shalt no more rejoice, O thouoppressed virgin, daughter of Zidon: arise, pass over to Chittim; therealso shalt thou have no rest. 

{23:13} Behold the land of the Chaldeans;this people was not, [til] the Assyrian founded it for them that dwellin the wilderness: they set up the towers thereof, they raised up thepalaces thereof; [and] he brought it to ruin. 

{23:14} Howl, ye ships ofTarshish: for your strength is laid waste. 

{23:15} And it shall come topass in that day, that Tyre shall be forgotten seventy years, accordingto the days of one king: after the end of seventy years shall Tyre singas an harlot. 

{23:16} Take an harp, go about the city, thou harlot thathast been forgotten; make sweet melody, sing many songs, that thoumayest be remembered.   

{23:17} And it shall come to pass after the end of seventy years,that the LORD will visit Tyre, and she shall turn to her hire, andshall commit fornication with all the kingdoms of the world upon theface of the earth. 

{23:18} And her merchandise and her hire shall beholiness to the LORD: it shall not be treasured nor laid up; for hermerchandise shall be for them that dwell before the LORD, to eatsufficiently, and for durable clothing.   

{24:1} Behold, the LORD maketh the earth empty, and maketh it waste,and turneth it upside down, and scattereth abroad the inhabitantsthereof. 

{24:2} And it shall be, as with the people, so with thepriest; as with the servant, so with his master; as with the maid, sowith her mistress; as with the buyer, so with the seller; as with thelender, so with the borrower; as with the taker of usury, so with thegiver of usury to him. 

{24:3} The land shall be utterly emptied, andutterly spoiled: for the LORD hath spoken this word. 

{24:4} The earthmourneth [and] fadeth away, the world languisheth [and] fadeth away,the haughty people of the earth do languish. 

{24:5} The earth also isdefiled under the inhabitants thereof; because they have transgressedthe laws, changed the ordinance, broken the everlasting covenant.

{24:6} Therefore hath the curse devoured the earth, and they that dwelltherein are desolate: therefore the inhabitants of the earth areburned, and few men left. 

{24:7} The new wine mourneth, the vinelanguisheth, all the merryhearted do sigh. 

{24:8} The mirth of tabretsceaseth, the noise of them that rejoice endeth, the joy of the harpceaseth. 

{24:9} They shall not drink wine with a song; strong drinkshall be bitter to them that drink it. 

{24:10} The city of confusion isbroken down: every house is shut up, that no man may come in. 

{24:11}[There is] a crying for wine in the streets; all joy is darkened, themirth of the land is gone. 

{24:12} In the city is left desolation, andthe gate is smitten with destruction.   

{24:13} When thus it shall be in the midst of the land among thepeople, [there shall be] as the shaking of an olive tree, [and] as thegleaning grapes when the vintage is done. 

{24:14} They shall lift uptheir voice, they shall sing for the majesty of the LORD, they shallcry aloud from the sea. 

{24:15} Wherefore glorify ye the LORD in thefires, [even] the name of the LORD God of Israel in the isles of thesea.   

{24:16} From the uttermost part of the earth have we heard songs,[even] glory to the righteous. But I said, My leanness, my leanness,woe unto me! the treacherous dealers have dealt treacherously; yea, thetreacherous dealers have dealt very treacherously. 

{24:17} Fear, andthe pit, and the snare, [are] upon thee, O inhabitant of the earth.

{24:18} And it shall come to pass, [that] he who fleeth from the noiseof the fear shall fall into the pit; and he that cometh up out of themidst of the pit shall be taken in the snare: for the windows from onhigh are open, and the foundations of the earth do shake. 

{24:19} Theearth is utterly broken down, the earth is clean dissolved, the earthis moved exceedingly. 

{24:20} The earth shall reel to and fro like adrunkard, and shall be removed like a cottage; and the transgressionthereof shall be heavy upon it; and it shall fall, and not rise again.

{24:21} And it shall come to pass in that day, [that] the LORD shallpunish the host of the high ones [that are] on high, and the kings ofthe earth upon the earth. 

{24:22} And they shall be gathered together,[as] prisoners are gathered in the pit, and shall be shut up in theprison, and after many days shall they be visited. 

{24:23} Then themoon shall be confounded, and the sun ashamed, when the LORD of hostsshall reign in mount Zion, and in Jerusalem, and before his ancientsgloriously.   

{25:1} O LORD, thou [art] my God; I will exalt thee, I will praisethy name; for thou hast done wonderful [things; thy] counsels of old[are] faithfulness [and] truth. 

{25:2} For thou hast made of a city anheap; [of] a defenced city a ruin: a palace of strangers to be no city;it shall never be built. 

{25:3} Therefore shall the strong peopleglorify thee, the city of the terrible nations shall fear thee. 

{25:4}For thou hast been a strength to the poor, a strength to the needy inhis distress, a refuge from the storm, a shadow from the heat, when theblast of the terrible ones [is] as a storm [against] the wall. 

{25:5}Thou shalt bring down the noise of strangers, as the heat in a dryplace; [even] the heat with the shadow of a cloud: the branch of theterrible ones shall be brought low.   

{25:6} And in this mountain shall the LORD of hosts make unto allpeople a feast of fat things, a feast of wines on the lees, of fatthings full of marrow, of wines on the lees well refined. 

{25:7} And hewill destroy in this mountain the face of the covering cast over allpeople, and the vail that is spread over all nations. 

{25:8} He willswallow up death in victory; and the Lord GOD will wipe away tears fromoff all faces; and the rebuke of his people shall he take away from offall the earth: for the LORD hath spoken [it.]   

{25:9} And it shall be said in that day, Lo, this [is] our God; wehave waited for him, and he will save us: this [is] the LORD; we havewaited for him, we will be glad and rejoice in his salvation. 

{25:10}For in this mountain shall the hand of the LORD rest, and Moab shall betrodden down under him, even as straw is trodden down for the dunghill.

{25:11} And he shall spread forth his hands in the midst of them, as hethat swimmeth spreadeth forth [his hands] to swim: and he shall bringdown their pride together with the spoils of their hands. 

{25:12} Andthe fortress of the high fort of thy walls shall he bring down, laylow, [and] bring to the ground, [even] to the dust.   

{26:1} In that day shall this song be sung in the land of Judah; Wehave a strong city; salvation will [God] appoint [for] walls andbulwarks. 

{26:2} Open ye the gates, that the righteous nation whichkeepeth the truth may enter in. 

{26:3} Thou wilt keep [him] in perfectpeace, [whose] mind [is] stayed [on thee:] because he trusteth in thee.

{26:4} Trust ye in the LORD for ever: for in the LORD JEHOVAH [is]everlasting strength:   

{26:5} For he bringeth down them that dwell on high; the lofty city,he layeth it low; he layeth it low, [even] to the ground; he bringethit [even] to the dust. 

{26:6} The foot shall tread it down, [even] thefeet of the poor, [and] the steps of the needy. 

{26:7} The way of thejust [is] uprightness: thou, most upright, dost weigh the path of thejust. 

{26:8} Yea, in the way of thy judgments, O LORD, have we waitedfor thee; the desire of [our] soul [is] to thy name, and to theremembrance of thee. 

{26:9} With my soul have I desired thee in thenight; yea, with my spirit within me will I seek thee early: for whenthy judgments [are] in the earth, the inhabitants of the world willlearn righteousness. 

{26:10} Let favour be shewed to the wicked, [yet]will he not learn righteousness: in the land of uprightness will hedeal unjustly, and will not behold the majesty of the LORD. 

{26:11}LORD, [when] thy hand is lifted up, they will not see: [but] they shallsee, and be ashamed for [their] envy at the people; yea, the fire ofthine enemies shall devour them.   

{26:12} LORD, thou wilt ordain peace for us: for thou also hastwrought all our works in us. 

{26:13} O LORD our God, [other] lordsbesides thee have had dominion over us: [but] by thee only will we makemention of thy name. 

{26:14} [They are] dead, they shall not live;[they are] deceased, they shall not rise: therefore hast thou visitedand destroyed them, and made all their memory to perish. 

{26:15} Thouhast increased the nation, O LORD, thou hast increased the nation: thouart glorified: thou hadst removed [it] far [unto] all the ends of theearth. 

{26:16} LORD, in trouble have they visited thee, they poured outa prayer [when] thy chastening [was] upon them. 

{26:17} Like as a womanwith child, [that] draweth near the time of her delivery, is in pain,[and] crieth out in her pangs; so have we been in thy sight, O LORD.

{26:18} We have been with child, we have been in pain, we have as itwere brought forth wind; we have not wrought any deliverance in theearth; neither have the inhabitants of the world fallen. 

{26:19} Thydead [men] shall live, [together with] my dead body shall they arise.Awake and sing, ye that dwell in dust: for thy dew [is as] the dew ofherbs, and the earth shall cast out the dead.   

{26:20} Come, my people, enter thou into thy chambers, and shut thydoors about thee: hide thyself as it were for a little moment, untilthe indignation be overpast. 

{26:21} For, behold, the LORD cometh outof his place to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity:the earth also shall disclose her blood, and shall no more cover herslain.   

{27:1} In that day the LORD with his sore and great and strong swordshall punish leviathan the piercing serpent, even leviathan thatcrooked serpent; and he shall slay the dragon that [is] in the sea.

{27:2} In that day sing ye unto her, A vineyard of red wine. 

{27:3} Ithe LORD do keep it; I will water it every moment: lest [any] hurt it,I will keep it night and day. 

{27:4} Fury [is] not in me: who would setthe briers [and] thorns against me in battle? I would go through them,I would burn them together. 

{27:5} Or let him take hold of my strength,[that] he may make peace with me; [and] he shall make peace with me.

{27:6} He shall cause them that come of Jacob to take root: Israelshall blossom and bud, and fill the face of the world with fruit.   

{27:7} Hath he smitten him, as he smote those that smote him? [or]is he slain according to the slaughter of them that are slain by him?

{27:8} In measure, when it shooteth forth, thou wilt debate with it: hestayeth his rough wind in the day of the east wind. 

{27:9} By thistherefore shall the iniquity of Jacob be purged; and this is all thefruit to take away his sin; when he maketh all the stones of the altaras chalkstones that are beaten in sunder, the groves and images shallnot stand up. 

{27:10} Yet the defenced city [shall be] desolate, [and]the habitation forsaken, and left like a wilderness: there shall thecalf feed, and there shall he lie down, and consume the branchesthereof. 

{27:11} When the boughs thereof are withered, they shall bebroken off: the women come, [and] set them on fire: for it [is] apeople of no understanding: therefore he that made them will not havemercy on them, and he that formed them will shew them no favour.   

{27:12} And it shall come to pass in that day, [that] the LORD shallbeat off from the channel of the river unto the stream of Egypt, and yeshall be gathered one by one, O ye children of Israel. 

{27:13} And itshall come to pass in that day, [that] the great trumpet shall beblown, and they shall come which were ready to perish in the land ofAssyria, and the outcasts in the land of Egypt, and shall worship theLORD in the holy mount at Jerusalem.   

{28:1} Woe to the crown of pride, to the drunkards of Ephraim, whoseglorious beauty is a fading flower, which [are] on the head of the fatvalleys of them that are overcome with wine! 

{28:2} Behold, the Lordhath a mighty and strong one, [which] as a tempest of hail [and] adestroying storm, as a flood of mighty waters overflowing, shall castdown to the earth with the hand. 

{28:3} The crown of pride, thedrunkards of Ephraim, shall be trodden under feet: 

{28:4} And theglorious beauty, which is on the head of the fat valley, shall be afading flower, [and] as the hasty fruit before the summer; which [when]he that looketh upon it seeth, while it is yet in his hand he eateth itup.   

{28:5} In that day shall the LORD of hosts be for a crown of glory,and for a diadem of beauty, unto the residue of his people, 

{28:6} Andfor a spirit of judgment to him that sitteth in judgment, and forstrength to them that turn the battle to the gate.   

{28:7} But they also have erred through wine, and through strongdrink are out of the way; the priest and the prophet have erred throughstrong drink, they are swallowed up of wine, they are out of the waythrough strong drink; they err in vision, they stumble [in] judgment.

{28:8} For all tables are full of vomit [and] filthiness, [so thatthere is] no place [clean.]   

{28:9} Whom shall he teach knowledge? and whom shall he make tounderstand doctrine? [them that are] weaned from the milk, [and] drawnfrom the breasts. 

{28:10} For precept [must be] upon precept, preceptupon precept; line upon line, line upon line; here a little, [and]there a little: 

{28:11} For with stammering lips and another tonguewill he speak to this people. 

{28:12} To whom he said, This [is] therest [wherewith] ye may cause the weary to rest; and this [is] therefreshing: yet they would not hear. 

{28:13} But the word of the LORDwas unto them precept upon precept, precept upon precept; line uponline, line upon line; here a little, [and] there a little; that theymight go, and fall backward, and be broken, and snared, and taken.   

{28:14} Wherefore hear the word of the LORD, ye scornful men, thatrule this people which [is] in Jerusalem. 

{28:15} Because ye have said,We have made a covenant with death, and with hell are we at agreement;when the overflowing scourge shall pass through, it shall not come untous: for we have made lies our refuge, and under falsehood have we hidourselves:   

{28:16} Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD, Behold, I lay in Zion fora foundation a stone, a tried stone, a precious corner [stone,] a surefoundation: he that believeth shall not make haste. 

{28:17} Judgmentalso will I lay to the line, and righteousness to the plummet: and thehail shall sweep away the refuge of lies, and the waters shall overflowthe hiding place.   

{28:18} And your covenant with death shall be disannulled, and youragreement with hell shall not stand; when the overflowing scourge shallpass through, then ye shall be trodden down by it. 

{28:19} From thetime that it goeth forth it shall take you: for morning by morningshall it pass over, by day and by night: and it shall be a vexationonly to understand the report. 

{28:20} For the bed is shorter than that[a man] can stretch himself [on it:] and the covering narrower thanthat he can wrap himself [in it. ]

{28:21} For the LORD shall rise up as[in] mount Perazim, he shall be wroth as [in] the valley of Gibeon,that he may do his work, his strange work; and bring to pass his act,his strange act. 

{28:22} Now therefore be ye not mockers, lest yourbands be made strong: for I have heard from the Lord GOD of hosts aconsumption, even determined upon the whole earth.   

{28:23} Give ye ear, and hear my voice; hearken, and hear my speech.

{28:24} Doth the plowman plow all day to sow? doth he open and breakthe clods of his ground? 

{28:25} When he hath made plain the facethereof, doth he not cast abroad the fitches, and scatter the cummin,and cast in the principal wheat and the appointed barley and rie intheir place? 

{28:26} For his God doth instruct him to discretion, [and]doth teach him. 

{28:27} For the fitches are not threshed with athreshing instrument, neither is a cart wheel turned about upon thecummin; but the fitches are beaten out with a staff, and the cumminwith a rod. 

{28:28} Bread [corn] is bruised; because he will not everbe threshing it, nor break [it with] the wheel of his cart, nor bruiseit [with] his horsemen. 

{28:29} This also cometh forth from the LORD ofhosts, [which] is wonderful in counsel, [and] excellent in working.   

{29:1} Woe to Ariel, to Ariel, the city [where] David dwelt! add yeyear to year; let them kill sacrifices. 

{29:2} Yet I will distressAriel, and there shall be heaviness and sorrow: and it shall be unto meas Ariel. 

{29:3} And I will camp against thee round about, and will laysiege against thee with a mount, and I will raise forts against thee.

{29:4} And thou shalt be brought down, [and] shalt speak out of theground, and thy speech shall be low out of the dust, and thy voiceshall be, as of one that hath a familiar spirit, out of the ground, andthy speech shall whisper out of the dust. 

{29:5} Moreover the multitudeof thy strangers shall be like small dust, and the multitude of theterrible ones [shall be] as chaff that passeth away: yea, it shall beat an instant suddenly. 

{29:6} Thou shalt be visited of the LORD ofhosts with thunder, and with earthquake, and great noise, with stormand tempest, and the flame of devouring fire.   

{29:7} And the multitude of all the nations that fight againstAriel, even all that fight against her and her munition, and thatdistress her, shall be as a dream of a night vision. 

{29:8} It shalleven be as when an hungry [man] dreameth, and, behold, he eateth; buthe awaketh, and his soul is empty: or as when a thirsty man dreameth,and, behold, he drinketh; but he awaketh, and, behold, [he is] faint,and his soul hath appetite: so shall the multitude of all the nationsbe, that fight against mount Zion. 

{29:9} Stay yourselves, and wonder;cry ye out, and cry: they are drunken, but not with wine; they stagger,but not with strong drink. 

{29:10} For the LORD hath poured out uponyou the spirit of deep sleep, and hath closed your eyes: the prophetsand your rulers, the seers hath he covered. 

{29:11} And the vision ofall is become unto you as the words of a book that is sealed, which[men] deliver to one that is learned, saying, Read this, I pray thee:and he saith, I cannot; for it [is] sealed: 

{29:12} And the book isdelivered to him that is not learned, saying, Read this, I pray thee:and he saith, I am not learned.   

{29:13} Wherefore the Lord said, Forasmuch as this people draw near[me] with their mouth, and with their lips do honour me, but haveremoved their heart far from me, and their fear toward me is taught bythe precept of men: 

{29:14} Therefore, behold, I will proceed to do amarvellous work among this people, [even] a marvellous work and awonder: for the wisdom of their wise [men] shall perish, and theunderstanding of their prudent [men] shall be hid. 

{29:15} Woe untothem that seek deep to hide their counsel from the LORD, and theirworks are in the dark, and they say, Who seeth us? and who knoweth us?

{29:16} Surely your turning of things upside down shall be esteemed asthe potter's clay: for shall the work say of him that made it, He mademe not? or shall the thing framed say of him that framed it, He had nounderstanding? 

{29:17} [Is] it not yet a very little while, and Lebanonshall be turned into a fruitful field, and the fruitful field shall beesteemed as a forest?   

{29:18} And in that day shall the deaf hear the words of the book,and the eyes of the blind shall see out of obscurity, and out ofdarkness. 

{29:19} The meek also shall increase [their] joy in the LORD,and the poor among men shall rejoice in the Holy One of Israel. 

{29:20}For the terrible one is brought to nought, and the scorner is consumed,and all that watch for iniquity are cut off: 

{29:21} That make a man anoffender for a word, and lay a snare for him that reproveth in thegate, and turn aside the just for a thing of nought. 

{29:22} Thereforethus saith the LORD, who redeemed Abraham, concerning the house ofJacob, Jacob shall not now be ashamed, neither shall his face now waxpale. 

{29:23} But when he seeth his children, the work of mine hands,in the midst of him, they shall sanctify my name, and sanctify the HolyOne of Jacob, and shall fear the God of Israel. 

{29:24} They also thaterred in spirit shall come to understanding, and they that murmuredshall learn doctrine.   

{30:1} Woe to the rebellious children, saith the LORD, that takecounsel, but not of me; and that cover with a covering, but not of myspirit, that they may add sin to sin: 

{30:2} That walk to go down intoEgypt, and have not asked at my mouth; to strengthen themselves in thestrength of Pharaoh, and to trust in the shadow of Egypt! 

{30:3}Therefore shall the strength of Pharaoh be your shame, and the trust inthe shadow of Egypt [your] confusion. 

{30:4} For his princes were atZoan, and his ambassadors came to Hanes. 

{30:5} They were all ashamedof a people [that] could not profit them, nor be an help nor profit,but a shame, and also a reproach. 

{30:6} The burden of the beasts ofthe south: into the land of trouble and anguish, from whence [come] theyoung and old lion, the viper and fiery flying serpent, they will carrytheir riches upon the shoulders of young asses, and their treasuresupon the bunches of camels, to a people [that] shall not profit [them.]

{30:7} For the Egyptians shall help in vain, and to no purpose:therefore have I cried concerning this, Their strength [is] to sitstill.   

{30:8} Now go, write it before them in a table, and note it in abook, that it may be for the time to come for ever and ever: 

{30:9}That this [is] a rebellious people, lying children, children [that]will not hear the law of the LORD: 

{30:10} Which say to the seers, Seenot; and to the prophets, Prophesy not unto us right things, speak untous smooth things, prophesy deceits: 

{30:11} Get you out of the way,turn aside out of the path, cause the Holy One of Israel to cease frombefore us. 

{30:12} Wherefore thus saith the Holy One of Israel, Becauseye despise this word, and trust in oppression and perverseness, andstay thereon: 

{30:13} Therefore this iniquity shall be to you as abreach ready to fall, swelling out in a high wall, whose breakingcometh suddenly at an instant. 

{30:14} And he shall break it as thebreaking of the potters' vessel that is broken in pieces; he shall notspare: so that there shall not be found in the bursting of it a sherdto take fire from the hearth, or to take water [withal] out of the pit.

{30:15} For thus saith the Lord GOD, the Holy One of Israel; Inreturning and rest shall ye be saved; in quietness and in confidenceshall be your strength: and ye would not. 

{30:16} But ye said, No; forwe will flee upon horses; therefore shall ye flee: and, We will rideupon the swift; therefore shall they that pursue you be swift. 

{30:17}One thousand [shall flee] at the rebuke of one; at the rebuke of fiveshall ye flee: till ye be left as a beacon upon the top of a mountain,and as an ensign on an hill.   

{30:18} And therefore will the LORD wait, that he may be graciousunto you, and therefore will he be exalted, that he may have mercy uponyou: for the LORD [is] a God of judgment: blessed [are] all they thatwait for him. 

{30:19} For the people shall dwell in Zion at Jerusalem:thou shalt weep no more: he will be very gracious unto thee at thevoice of thy cry; when he shall hear it, he will answer thee. 

{30:20}And [though] the Lord give you the bread of adversity, and the water ofaffliction, yet shall not thy teachers be removed into a corner anymore, but thine eyes shall see thy teachers: 

{30:21} And thine earsshall hear a word behind thee, saying, This [is] the way, walk ye init, when ye turn to the right hand, and when ye turn to the left.

{30:22} Ye shall defile also the covering of thy graven images ofsilver, and the ornament of thy molten images of gold: thou shalt castthem away as a menstruous cloth; thou shalt say unto it, Get theehence. 

{30:23} Then shall he give the rain of thy seed, that thou shaltsow the ground withal; and bread of the increase of the earth, and itshall be fat and plenteous: in that day shall thy cattle feed in largepastures. 

{30:24} The oxen likewise and the young asses that ear theground shall eat clean provender, which hath been winnowed with theshovel and with the fan. 

{30:25} And there shall be upon every highmountain, and upon every high hill, rivers [and] streams of waters inthe day of the great slaughter, when the towers fall. 

{30:26} Moreoverthe light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun, and the lightof the sun shall be sevenfold, as the light of seven days, in the daythat the LORD bindeth up the breach of his people, and healeth thestroke of their wound.   

{30:27} Behold, the name of the LORD cometh from far, burning [with]his anger, and the burden [thereof is] heavy: his lips are full ofindignation, and his tongue as a devouring fire: 

{30:28} And hisbreath, as an overflowing stream, shall reach to the midst of the neck,to sift the nations with the sieve of vanity: and [there shall be] abridle in the jaws of the people, causing [them] to err. 

{30:29} Yeshall have a song, as in the night [when] a holy solemnity is kept; andgladness of heart, as when one goeth with a pipe to come into themountain of the LORD, to the mighty One of Israel. 

{30:30} And the LORDshall cause his glorious voice to be heard, and shall shew the lightingdown of his arm, with the indignation of [his] anger, and [with] theflame of a devouring fire, [with] scattering, and tempest, andhailstones. 

{30:31} For through the voice of the LORD shall theAssyrian be beaten down, [which] smote with a rod. 

{30:32} And [in]every place where the grounded staff shall pass, which the LORD shalllay upon him, [it] shall be with tabrets and harps: and in battles ofshaking will he fight with it. 

{30:33} For Tophet [is] ordained of old;yea, for the king it is prepared; he hath made [it] deep [and] large:the pile thereof [is] fire and much wood; the breath of the LORD, likea stream of brimstone, doth kindle it.   

{31:1} Woe to them that go down to Egypt for help; and stay onhorses, and trust in chariots, because [they are] many; and inhorsemen, because they are very strong; but they look not unto the HolyOne of Israel, neither seek the LORD! 

{31:2} Yet he also [is] wise, andwill bring evil, and will not call back his words: but will ariseagainst the house of the evildoers, and against the help of them thatwork iniquity. 

{31:3} Now the Egyptians [are] men, and not God; andtheir horses flesh, and not spirit. When the LORD shall stretch out hishand, both he that helpeth shall fall, and he that is holpen shall falldown, and they all shall fail together. 

{31:4} For thus hath the LORDspoken unto me, Like as the lion and the young lion roaring on hisprey, when a multitude of shepherds is called forth against him, [he]will not be afraid of their voice, nor abase himself for the noise ofthem: so shall the LORD of hosts come down to fight for mount Zion, andfor the hill thereof. 

{31:5} As birds flying, so will the LORD of hostsdefend Jerusalem; defending also he will deliver [it; and] passing overhe will preserve [it.]   

{31:6} Turn ye unto [him from] whom the children of Israel havedeeply revolted. 

{31:7} For in that day every man shall cast away hisidols of silver, and his idols of gold, which your own hands have madeunto you [for] a sin.   

{31:8} Then shall the Assyrian fall with the sword, not of a mightyman; and the sword, not of a mean man, shall devour him: but he shallflee from the sword, and his young men shall be discomfited. 

{31:9} Andhe shall pass over to his strong hold for fear, and his princes shallbe afraid of the ensign, saith the LORD, whose fire [is] in Zion, andhis furnace in Jerusalem.   

{32:1} Behold, a king shall reign in righteousness, and princesshall rule in judgment. 

{32:2} And a man shall be as an hiding placefrom the wind, and a covert from the tempest; as rivers of water in adry place, as the shadow of a great rock in a weary land. 

{32:3} Andthe eyes of them that see shall not be dim, and the ears of them thathear shall hearken. 

{32:4} The heart also of the rash shall understandknowledge, and the tongue of the stammerers shall be ready to speakplainly. 

{32:5} The vile person shall be no more called liberal, northe churl said [to be] bountiful. 

{32:6} For the vile person will speakvillany, and his heart will work iniquity, to practise hypocrisy, andto utter error against the LORD, to make empty the soul of the hungry,and he will cause the drink of the thirsty to fail. 

{32:7} Theinstruments also of the churl [are] evil: he deviseth wicked devices todestroy the poor with lying words, even when the needy speaketh right.

{32:8} But the liberal deviseth liberal things; and by liberal thingsshall he stand.   

{32:9} Rise up, ye women that are at ease; hear my voice, yecareless daughters; give ear unto my speech. 

{32:10} Many days andyears shall ye be troubled, ye careless women: for the vintage shallfail, the gathering shall not come. 

{32:11} Tremble, ye women that areat ease; be troubled, ye careless ones: strip you, and make you bare,and gird [sackcloth] upon [your] loins. 

{32:12} They shall lament forthe teats, for the pleasant fields, for the fruitful vine. 

{32:13} Uponthe land of my people shall come up thorns [and] briers; yea, upon allthe houses of joy [in] the joyous city: 

{32:14} Because the palacesshall be forsaken; the multitude of the city shall be left; the fortsand towers shall be for dens for ever, a joy of wild asses, a pastureof flocks; 

{32:15} Until the spirit be poured upon us from on high, andthe wilderness be a fruitful field, and the fruitful field be countedfor a forest. 

{32:16} Then judgment shall dwell in the wilderness, andrighteousness remain in the fruitful field. 

{32:17} And the work ofrighteousness shall be peace; and the effect of righteousness quietnessand assurance for ever. 

{32:18} And my people shall dwell in apeaceable habitation, and in sure dwellings, and in quiet restingplaces; 

{32:19} When it shall hail, coming down on the forest; and thecity shall be low in a low place. 

{32:20} Blessed [are] ye that sowbeside all waters, that send forth [thither] the feet of the ox and theass.   

{33:1} Woe to thee that spoilest, and thou [wast] not spoiled; anddealest treacherously, and they dealt not treacherously with thee! whenthou shalt cease to spoil, thou shalt be spoiled; [and] when thou shaltmake an end to deal treacherously, they shall deal treacherously withthee. 

{33:2} O LORD, be gracious unto us; we have waited for thee: bethou their arm every morning, our salvation also in the time oftrouble. 

{33:3} At the noise of the tumult the people fled; at thelifting up of thyself the nations were scattered. 

{33:4} And your spoilshall be gathered [like] the gathering of the caterpiller: as therunning to and fro of locusts shall he run upon them. 

{33:5} The LORDis exalted; for he dwelleth on high: he hath filled Zion with judgmentand righteousness. 

{33:6} And wisdom and knowledge shall be thestability of thy times, [and] strength of salvation: the fear of theLORD [is] his treasure. 

{33:7} Behold, their valiant ones shall crywithout: the ambassadors of peace shall weep bitterly. 

{33:8} Thehighways lie waste, the wayfaring man ceaseth: he hath broken thecovenant, he hath despised the cities, he regardeth no man. 

{33:9} Theearth mourneth [and] languisheth: Lebanon is ashamed [and] hewn down:Sharon is like a wilderness; and Bashan and Carmel shake off [theirfruits. ]

{33:10} Now will I rise, saith the LORD; now will I beexalted; now will I lift up myself. 

{33:11} Ye shall conceive chaff, yeshall bring forth stubble: your breath, [as] fire, shall devour you.

{33:12} And the people shall be as the burnings of lime: [as] thornscut up shall they be burned in the fire.   

{33:13} Hear, ye [that are] far off, what I have done; and, ye [thatare] near, acknowledge my might. 

{33:14} The sinners in Zion areafraid; fearfulness hath surprised the hypocrites. Who among us shalldwell with the devouring fire? who among us shall dwell witheverlasting burnings? 

{33:15} He that walketh righteously, and speakethuprightly; he that despiseth the gain of oppressions, that shaketh hishands from holding of bribes, that stoppeth his ears from hearing ofblood, and shutteth his eyes from seeing evil; 

{33:16} He shall dwellon high: his place of defence [shall be] the munitions of rocks: breadshall be given him; his waters [shall be] sure. 

{33:17} Thine eyesshall see the king in his beauty: they shall behold the land that isvery far off. 

{33:18} Thine heart shall meditate terror. Where [is] thescribe? where [is] the receiver? where [is] he that counted the towers?

{33:19} Thou shalt not see a fierce people, a people of a deeper speechthan thou canst perceive; of a stammering tongue, [that thou canst] notunderstand. 

{33:20} Look upon Zion, the city of our solemnities: thineeyes shall see Jerusalem a quiet habitation, a tabernacle [that] shallnot be taken down; not one of the stakes thereof shall ever be removed,neither shall any of the cords thereof be broken. 

{33:21} But there theglorious LORD [will be] unto us a place of broad rivers [and] streams;wherein shall go no galley with oars, neither shall gallant ship passthereby. 

{33:22} For the LORD [is] our judge, the LORD [is] ourlawgiver, the LORD [is] our king; he will save us. 

{33:23} Thytacklings are loosed; they could not well strengthen their mast, theycould not spread the sail: then is the prey of a great spoil divided;the lame take the prey. 

{33:24} And the inhabitant shall not say, I amsick: the people that dwell therein [shall be] forgiven [their]iniquity.   

{34:1} Come near, ye nations, to hear; and hearken, ye people: letthe earth hear, and all that is therein; the world, and all things thatcome forth of it. 

{34:2} For the indignation of the LORD [is] upon allnations, and [his] fury upon all their armies: he hath utterlydestroyed them, he hath delivered them to the slaughter. 

{34:3} Theirslain also shall be cast out, and their stink shall come up out oftheir carcases, and the mountains shall be melted with their blood.

{34:4} And all the host of heaven shall be dissolved, and the heavensshall be rolled together as a scroll: and all their host shall falldown, as the leaf falleth off from the vine, and as a falling [fig]from the fig tree. 

{34:5} For my sword shall be bathed in heaven:behold, it shall come down upon Idumea, and upon the people of mycurse, to judgment. 

{34:6} The sword of the LORD is filled with blood,it is made fat with fatness, [and] with the blood of lambs and goats,with the fat of the kidneys of rams: for the LORD hath a sacrifice inBozrah, and a great slaughter in the land of Idumea. 

{34:7} And theunicorns shall come down with them, and the bullocks with the bulls;and their land shall be soaked with blood, and their dust made fat withfatness. 

{34:8} For [it is] the day of the LORD'S vengeance, [and] theyear of recompences for the controversy of Zion. 

{34:9} And the streamsthereof shall be turned into pitch, and the dust thereof intobrimstone, and the land thereof shall become burning pitch. 

{34:10} Itshall not be quenched night nor day; the smoke thereof shall go up forever: from generation to generation it shall lie waste; none shall passthrough it for ever and ever. 

{34:11} But the cormorant and the bitternshall possess it; the owl also and the raven shall dwell in it: and heshall stretch out upon it the line of confusion, and the stones ofemptiness. 

{34:12} They shall call the nobles thereof to the kingdom,but none [shall be] there, and all her princes shall be nothing.

{34:13} And thorns shall come up in her palaces, nettles and bramblesin the fortresses thereof: and it shall be an habitation of dragons,[and] a court for owls. 

{34:14} The wild beasts of the desert shallalso meet with the wild beasts of the island, and the satyr shall cryto his fellow; the screech owl also shall rest there, and find forherself a place of rest. 

{34:15} There shall the great owl make hernest, and lay, and hatch, and gather under her shadow: there shall thevultures also be gathered, every one with her mate.   

{34:16} Seek ye out of the book of the LORD, and read: no one ofthese shall fail, none shall want her mate: for my mouth it hathcommanded, and his spirit it hath gathered them. 

{34:17} And he hathcast the lot for them, and his hand hath divided it unto them by line:they shall possess it for ever, from generation to generation shallthey dwell therein.   

{35:1} The wilderness and the solitary place shall be glad for them;and the desert shall rejoice, and blossom as the rose. 

{35:2} It shallblossom abundantly, and rejoice even with joy and singing: the glory ofLebanon shall be given unto it, the excellency of Carmel and Sharon,they shall see the glory of the LORD, [and] the excellency of our God.   

{35:3} Strengthen ye the weak hands, and confirm the feeble knees.

{35:4} Say to them [that are] of a fearful heart, Be strong, fear not:behold, your God will come [with] vengeance, [even] God [with] arecompence; he will come and save you. 

{35:5} Then the eyes of theblind shall be opened, and the ears of the deaf shall be unstopped.

{35:6} Then shall the lame [man] leap as an hart, and the tongue of thedumb sing: for in the wilderness shall waters break out, and streams inthe desert. 

{35:7} And the parched ground shall become a pool, and thethirsty land springs of water: in the habitation of dragons, where eachlay, [shall be] grass with reeds and rushes. 

{35:8} And an highwayshall be there, and a way, and it shall be called The way of holiness;the unclean shall not pass over it; but it [shall be] for those: thewayfaring men, though fools, shall not err [therein. ]

{35:9} No lionshall be there, nor [any] ravenous beast shall go up thereon, it shallnot be found there; but the redeemed shall walk [there: ]

{35:10} Andthe ransomed of the LORD shall return, and come to Zion with songs andeverlasting joy upon their heads: they shall obtain joy and gladness,and sorrow and sighing shall flee away.   

{36:1} Now it came to pass in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah,[that] Sennacherib king of Assyria came up against all the defencedcities of Judah, and took them. 

{36:2} And the king of Assyria sentRabshakeh from Lachish to Jerusalem unto king Hezekiah with a greatarmy. And he stood by the conduit of the upper pool in the highway ofthe fuller's field. 

{36:3} Then came forth unto him Eliakim, Hilkiah'sson, which was over the house, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, Asaph'sson, the recorder.   

{36:4} And Rabshakeh said unto them, Say ye now to Hezekiah, Thussaith the great king, the king of Assyria, What confidence is thiswherein thou trustest? 

{36:5} I say, [sayest thou,] (but [they are but]vain words) [I have] counsel and strength for war: now on whom dostthou trust, that thou rebellest against me? 

{36:6} Lo, thou trustest inthe staff of this broken reed, on Egypt; whereon if a man lean, it willgo into his hand, and pierce it: so [is] Pharaoh king of Egypt to allthat trust in him. 

{36:7} But if thou say to me, We trust in the LORDour God: [is it] not he, whose high places and whose altars Hezekiahhath taken away, and said to Judah and to Jerusalem, Ye shall worshipbefore this altar? 

{36:8} Now therefore give pledges, I pray thee, tomy master the king of Assyria, and I will give thee two thousandhorses, if thou be able on thy part to set riders upon them. 

{36:9} Howthen wilt thou turn away the face of one captain of the least of mymaster's servants, and put thy trust on Egypt for chariots and forhorsemen? 

{36:10} And am I now come up without the LORD against thisland to destroy it? the LORD said unto me, Go up against this land, anddestroy it.   

{36:11} Then said Eliakim and Shebna and Joah unto Rabshakeh, Speak,I pray thee, unto thy servants in the Syrian language; for weunderstand [it:] and speak not to us in the Jews' language, in the earsof the people that [are] on the wall.   

{36:12} But Rabshakeh said, Hath my master sent me to thy master andto thee to speak these words? [hath he] not [sent me] to the men thatsit upon the wall, that they may eat their own dung, and drink theirown piss with you? 

{36:13} Then Rabshakeh stood, and cried with a loudvoice in the Jews' language, and said, Hear ye the words of the greatking, the king of Assyria. 

{36:14} Thus saith the king, Let notHezekiah deceive you: for he shall not be able to deliver you. 

{36:15}Neither let Hezekiah make you trust in the LORD, saying, The LORD willsurely deliver us: this city shall not be delivered into the hand ofthe king of Assyria. 

{36:16} Hearken not to Hezekiah: for thus saiththe king of Assyria, Make [an agreement] with me [by] a present, andcome out to me: and eat ye every one of his vine, and every one of hisfig tree, and drink ye every one the waters of his own cistern; 

{36:17}Until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land ofcorn and wine, a land of bread and vineyards. 

{36:18} [Beware] lestHezekiah persuade you, saying, The LORD will deliver us. Hath any ofthe gods of the nations delivered his land out of the hand of the kingof Assyria? 

{36:19} Where [are] the gods of Hamath and Arphad? where[are] the gods of Sepharvaim? and have they delivered Samaria out of myhand? 

{36:20} Who [are they] among all the gods of these lands, thathave delivered their land out of my hand, that the LORD should deliverJerusalem out of my hand? 

{36:21} But they held their peace, andanswered him not a word: for the king's commandment was, saying, Answerhim not.   

{36:22} Then came Eliakim, the son of Hilkiah, that [was] over thehousehold, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, the son of Asaph, therecorder, to Hezekiah with [their] clothes rent, and told him the wordsof Rabshakeh.   

{37:1} And it came to pass, when king Hezekiah heard [it,] that herent his clothes, and covered himself with sackcloth, and went into thehouse of the LORD. 

{37:2} And he sent Eliakim, who [was] over thehousehold, and Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests coveredwith sackcloth, unto Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz. 

{37:3} Andthey said unto him, Thus saith Hezekiah, This day [is] a day oftrouble, and of rebuke, and of blasphemy: for the children are come tothe birth, and [there is] not strength to bring forth. 

{37:4} It may bethe LORD thy God will hear the words of Rabshakeh, whom the king ofAssyria his master hath sent to reproach the living God, and willreprove the words which the LORD thy God hath heard: wherefore lift up[thy] prayer for the remnant that is left. 

{37:5} So the servants ofking Hezekiah came to Isaiah.   

{37:6} And Isaiah said unto them, Thus shall ye say unto yourmaster, Thus saith the LORD, Be not afraid of the words that thou hastheard, wherewith the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemedme. 

{37:7} Behold, I will send a blast upon him, and he shall hear arumour, and return to his own land; and I will cause him to fall by thesword in his own land.   

{37:8} So Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warringagainst Libnah: for he had heard that he was departed from Lachish.

{37:9} And he heard say concerning Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, He iscome forth to make war with thee. And when he heard [it,] he sentmessengers to Hezekiah, saying, 

{37:10} Thus shall ye speak to Hezekiahking of Judah, saying, Let not thy God, in whom thou trustest, deceivethee, saying, Jerusalem shall not be given into the hand of the king ofAssyria. 

{37:11} Behold, thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria havedone to all lands by destroying them utterly; and shalt thou bedelivered? 

{37:12} Have the gods of the nations delivered them which myfathers have destroyed, [as] Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and thechildren of Eden which [were] in Telassar? 

{37:13} Where [is] the kingof Hamath, and the king of Arphad, and the king of the city ofSepharvaim, Hena, and Ivah?   

{37:14} And Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of themessengers, and read it: and Hezekiah went up unto the house of theLORD, and spread it before the LORD. 

{37:15} And Hezekiah prayed untothe LORD, saying, 

{37:16} O LORD of hosts, God of Israel, that dwellest[between] the cherubims, thou [art] the God, [even] thou alone, of allthe kingdoms of the earth: thou hast made heaven and earth. 

{37:17}Incline thine ear, O LORD, and hear; open thine eyes, O LORD, and see:and hear all the words of Sennacherib, which hath sent to reproach theliving God. 

{37:18} Of a truth, LORD, the kings of Assyria have laidwaste all the nations, and their countries, 

{37:19} And have cast theirgods into the fire: for they [were] no gods, but the work of men'shands, wood and stone: therefore they have destroyed them. 

{37:20} Nowtherefore, O LORD our God, save us from his hand, that all the kingdomsof the earth may know that thou [art] the LORD, [even] thou only.   

{37:21} Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent unto Hezekiah, saying, Thussaith the LORD God of Israel, Whereas thou hast prayed to me againstSennacherib king of Assyria: 

{37:22} This [is] the word which the LORDhath spoken concerning him; The virgin, the daughter of Zion, hathdespised thee, [and] laughed thee to scorn; the daughter of Jerusalemhath shaken her head at thee. 

{37:23} Whom hast thou reproached andblasphemed? and against whom hast thou exalted [thy] voice, and liftedup thine eyes on high? [even] against the Holy One of Israel. 

{37:24}By thy servants hast thou reproached the Lord, and hast said, By themultitude of my chariots am I come up to the height of the mountains,to the sides of Lebanon; and I will cut down the tall cedars thereof,[and] the choice fir trees thereof: and I will enter into the height ofhis border, [and] the forest of his Carmel. 

{37:25} I have digged, anddrunk water; and with the sole of my feet have I dried up all therivers of the besieged places. 

{37:26} Hast thou not heard long ago,[how] I have done it; [and] of ancient times, that I have formed it?now have I brought it to pass, that thou shouldest be to lay wastedefenced cities [into] ruinous heaps. 

{37:27} Therefore theirinhabitants [were] of small power, they were dismayed and confounded:they were [as] the grass of the field, and [as] the green herb, [as]the grass on the housetops, and [as corn] blasted before it be grownup. 

{37:28} But I know thy abode, and thy going out, and thy coming in,and thy rage against me. 

{37:29} Because thy rage against me, and thytumult, is come up into mine ears, therefore will I put my hook in thynose, and my bridle in thy lips, and I will turn thee back by the wayby which thou camest. 

{37:30} And this [shall be] a sign unto thee, Yeshall eat [this] year such as groweth of itself; and the second yearthat which springeth of the same: and in the third year sow ye, andreap, and plant vineyards, and eat the fruit thereof. 

{37:31} And theremnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall again take rootdownward, and bear fruit upward: 

{37:32} For out of Jerusalem shall goforth a remnant, and they that escape out of mount Zion: the zeal ofthe LORD of hosts shall do this. 

{37:33} Therefore thus saith the LORDconcerning the king of Assyria, He shall not come into this city, norshoot an arrow there nor come before it with shields, nor cast a bankagainst it. 

{37:34} By the way that he came, by the same shall hereturn, and shall not come into this city, saith the LORD. 

{37:35} ForI will defend this city to save it for mine own sake, and for myservant David's sake. 

{37:36} Then the angel of the LORD went forth,and smote in the camp of the Assyrians a hundred and fourscore and fivethousand: and when they arose early in the morning, behold, they [were]all dead corpses.   

{37:37} So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went andreturned, and dwelt at Nineveh. 

{37:38} And it came to pass, as he wasworshipping in the house of Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech andSharezer his sons smote him with the sword; and they escaped into theland of Armenia: and Esar-haddon his son reigned in his stead.   

{38:1} In those days was Hezekiah sick unto death. And Isaiah theprophet the son of Amoz came unto him, and said unto him, Thus saiththe LORD, Set thine house in order: for thou shalt die, and not live.

{38:2} Then Hezekiah turned his face toward the wall, and prayed untothe LORD, 

{38:3} And said, Remember now, O LORD, I beseech thee, how Ihave walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart, and havedone [that which is] good in thy sight. And Hezekiah wept sore.   

{38:4} Then came the word of the LORD to Isaiah, saying, 

{38:5} Go,and say to Hezekiah, Thus saith the LORD, the God of David thy father,I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy tears: behold, I will add untothy days fifteen years. 

{38:6} And I will deliver thee and this cityout of the hand of the king of Assyria: and I will defend this city.

{38:7} And this [shall be] a sign unto thee from the LORD, that theLORD will do this thing that he hath spoken; 

{38:8} Behold, I willbring again the shadow of the degrees, which is gone down in the sundial of Ahaz, ten degrees backward. So the sun returned ten degrees, bywhich degrees it was gone down.   

{38:9} The writing of Hezekiah king of Judah, when he had been sick,and was recovered of his sickness: 

{38:10} I said in the cutting off ofmy days, I shall go to the gates of the grave: I am deprived of theresidue of my years. 

{38:11} I said, I shall not see the LORD, [even]the LORD, in the land of the living: I shall behold man no more withthe inhabitants of the world. 

{38:12} Mine age is departed, and isremoved from me as a shepherd's tent: I have cut off like a weaver mylife: he will cut me off with pining sickness: from day [even] to nightwilt thou make an end of me. 

{38:13} I reckoned till morning, [that,]as a lion, so will he break all my bones: from day [even] to night wiltthou make an end of me. 

{38:14} Like a crane [or] a swallow, so did Ichatter: I did mourn as a dove: mine eyes fail [with looking] upward: OLORD, I am oppressed; undertake for me. 

{38:15} What shall I say? hehath both spoken unto me, and himself hath done [it:] I shall go softlyall my years in the bitterness of my soul. 

{38:16} O Lord, by these[things men] live, and in all these [things is] the life of my spirit:so wilt thou recover me, and make me to live. 

{38:17} Behold, for peaceI had great bitterness: but thou hast in love to my soul [delivered it]from the pit of corruption: for thou hast cast all my sins behind thyback. 

{38:18} For the grave cannot praise thee, death can [not]celebrate thee: they that go down into the pit cannot hope for thytruth. 

{38:19} The living, the living, he shall praise thee, as I [do]this day: the father to the children shall make known thy truth.

{38:20} The LORD [was ready] to save me: therefore we will sing mysongs to the stringed instruments all the days of our life in the houseof the LORD. 

{38:21} For Isaiah had said, Let them take a lump of figs,and lay [it] for a plaister upon the boil, and he shall recover.

{38:22} Hezekiah also had said, What [is] the sign that I shall go upto the house of the LORD?   

{39:1} At that time Merodach-baladan, the son of Baladan, king ofBabylon, sent letters and a present to Hezekiah: for he had heard thathe had been sick, and was recovered. 

{39:2} And Hezekiah was glad ofthem, and shewed them the house of his precious things, the silver, andthe gold, and the spices, and the precious ointment, and all the houseof his armour, and all that was found in his treasures: there wasnothing in his house, nor in all his dominion, that Hezekiah shewedthem not.   

{39:3} Then came Isaiah the prophet unto king Hezekiah, and saidunto him, What said these men? and from whence came they unto thee? AndHezekiah said, They are come from a far country unto me, [even] fromBabylon. 

{39:4} Then said he, What have they seen in thine house? AndHezekiah answered, All that [is] in mine house have they seen: there isnothing among my treasures that I have not shewed them. 

{39:5} Thensaid Isaiah to Hezekiah, Hear the word of the LORD of hosts: 

{39:6}Behold, the days come, that all that [is] in thine house, and [that]which thy fathers have laid up in store until this day, shall becarried to Babylon: nothing shall be left, saith the LORD. 

{39:7} Andof thy sons that shall issue from thee, which thou shalt beget, shallthey take away; and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king ofBabylon. 

{39:8} Then said Hezekiah to Isaiah, Good [is] the word of theLORD which thou hast spoken. He said moreover, For there shall be peaceand truth in my days.   

{40:1} Comfort ye, comfort ye my people, saith your God. 

{40:2}Speak ye comfortably to Jerusalem, and cry unto her, that her warfareis accomplished, that her iniquity is pardoned: for she hath receivedof the LORD'S hand double for all her sins.   

{40:3} The voice of him that crieth in the wilderness, Prepare yethe way of the LORD, make straight in the desert a highway for our God.

{40:4} Every valley shall be exalted, and every mountain and hill shallbe made low: and the crooked shall be made straight, and the roughplaces plain: 

{40:5} And the glory of the LORD shall be revealed, andall flesh shall see [it] together: for the mouth of the LORD hathspoken [it. ]

{40:6} The voice said, Cry. And he said, What shall I cry?All flesh [is] grass, and all the goodliness thereof [is] as the flowerof the field: 

{40:7} The grass withereth, the flower fadeth: becausethe spirit of the LORD bloweth upon it: surely the people [is] grass.

{40:8} The grass withereth, the flower fadeth: but the word of our Godshall stand for ever.   

{40:9} O Zion, that bringest good tidings, get thee up into the highmountain; O Jerusalem, that bringest good tidings, lift up thy voicewith strength; lift [it] up, be not afraid; say unto the cities ofJudah, Behold your God! 

{40:10} Behold, the Lord GOD will come withstrong [hand,] and his arm shall rule for him: behold, his reward [is]with him, and his work before him. 

{40:11} He shall feed his flock likea shepherd: he shall gather the lambs with his arm, and carry [them] inhis bosom, [and] shall gently lead those that are with young.   

{40:12} Who hath measured the waters in the hollow of his hand, andmeted out heaven with the span, and comprehended the dust of the earthin a measure, and weighed the mountains in scales, and the hills in abalance? 

{40:13} Who hath directed the Spirit of the LORD, or [being]his counsellor hath taught him? 

{40:14} With whom took he counsel, and[who] instructed him, and taught him in the path of judgment, andtaught him knowledge, and shewed to him the way of understanding?

{40:15} Behold, the nations [are] as a drop of a bucket, and arecounted as the small dust of the balance: behold, he taketh up theisles as a very little thing. 

{40:16} And Lebanon [is] not sufficientto burn, nor the beasts thereof sufficient for a burnt offering.

{40:17} All nations before him [are] as nothing; and they are countedto him less than nothing, and vanity.   

{40:18} To whom then will ye liken God? or what likeness will yecompare unto him? 

{40:19} The workman melteth a graven image, and thegoldsmith spreadeth it over with gold, and casteth silver chains.

{40:20} He that [is] so impoverished that he hath no oblation choosetha tree [that] will not rot; he seeketh unto him a cunning workman toprepare a graven image, [that] shall not be moved. 

{40:21} Have ye notknown? have ye not heard? hath it not been told you from the beginning?have ye not understood from the foundations of the earth? 

{40:22} [Itis] he that sitteth upon the circle of the earth, and the inhabitantsthereof [are] as grasshoppers; that stretcheth out the heavens as acurtain, and spreadeth them out as a tent to dwell in: 

{40:23} Thatbringeth the princes to nothing; he maketh the judges of the earth asvanity. 

{40:24} Yea, they shall not be planted; yea, they shall not besown: yea, their stock shall not take root in the earth: and he shallalso blow upon them, and they shall wither, and the whirlwind shalltake them away as stubble. 

{40:25} To whom then will ye liken me, orshall I be equal? saith the Holy One. 

{40:26} Lift up your eyes onhigh, and behold who hath created these [things,] that bringeth outtheir host by number: he calleth them all by names by the greatness ofhis might, for that [he is] strong in power; not one faileth. 

{40:27}Why sayest thou, O Jacob, and speakest, O Israel, My way is hid fromthe LORD, and my judgment is passed over from my God?   

{40:28} Hast thou not known? hast thou not heard, [that] theeverlasting God, the LORD, the Creator of the ends of the earth,fainteth not, neither is weary? [there is] no searching of hisunderstanding. 

{40:29} He giveth power to the faint; and to [them thathave] no might he increaseth strength. 

{40:30} Even the youths shallfaint and be weary, and the young men shall utterly fall: 

{40:31} Butthey that wait upon the LORD shall renew [their] strength; they shallmount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; [and]they shall walk, and not faint.   

{41:1} Keep silence before me, O islands; and let the people renew[their] strength: let them come near; then let them speak: let us comenear together to judgment. 

{41:2} Who raised up the righteous [man]from the east, called him to his foot, gave the nations before him, andmade [him] rule over kings? he gave [them] as the dust to his sword,[and] as driven stubble to his bow. 

{41:3} He pursued them, [and]passed safely; [even] by the way [that] he had not gone with his feet.

{41:4} Who hath wrought and done [it,] calling the generations from thebeginning? I the LORD, the first, and with the last; I [am] he. 

{41:5}The isles saw [it,] and feared; the ends of the earth were afraid, drewnear, and came. 

{41:6} They helped every one his neighbour; and [everyone] said to his brother, Be of good courage. 

{41:7} So the carpenterencouraged the goldsmith, [and] he that smootheth [with] the hammer himthat smote the anvil, saying, It is ready for the sodering: and hefastened it with nails, [that] it should not be moved. 

{41:8} But thou,Israel, [art] my servant, Jacob whom I have chosen, the seed of Abrahammy friend. 

{41:9} [Thou] whom I have taken from the ends of the earth,and called thee from the chief men thereof, and said unto thee, Thou[art] my servant; I have chosen thee, and not cast thee away.   

{41:10} Fear thou not; for I [am] with thee: be not dismayed; for I[am] thy God: I will strengthen thee; yea, I will help thee; yea, Iwill uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness. 

{41:11}Behold, all they that were incensed against thee shall be ashamed andconfounded: they shall be as nothing; and they that strive with theeshall perish. 

{41:12} Thou shalt seek them, and shalt not find them,[even] them that contended with thee: they that war against thee shallbe as nothing, and as a thing of nought. 

{41:13} For I the LORD thy Godwill hold thy right hand, saying unto thee, Fear not; I will help thee.

{41:14} Fear not, thou worm Jacob, [and] ye men of Israel; I will helpthee, saith the LORD, and thy redeemer, the Holy One of Israel. 

{41:15}Behold, I will make thee a new sharp threshing instrument having teeth:thou shalt thresh the mountains, and beat [them] small, and shalt makethe hills as chaff. 

{41:16} Thou shalt fan them, and the wind shallcarry them away, and the whirlwind shall scatter them: and thou shaltrejoice in the LORD, [and] shalt glory in the Holy One of Israel.

{41:17} [When] the poor and needy seek water, and [there is] none,[and] their tongue faileth for thirst, I the LORD will hear them, [I]the God of Israel will not forsake them. 

{41:18} I will open rivers inhigh places, and fountains in the midst of the valleys: I will make thewilderness a pool of water, and the dry land springs of water. 

{41:19}I will plant in the wilderness the cedar, the shittah tree, and themyrtle, and the oil tree; I will set in the desert the fir tree, [and]the pine, and the box tree together: 

{41:20} That they may see, andknow, and consider, and understand together, that the hand of the LORDhath done this, and the Holy One of Israel hath created it. 

{41:21}Produce your cause, saith the LORD; bring forth your strong [reasons,]saith the King of Jacob. 

{41:22} Let them bring [them] forth, and shewus what shall happen: let them shew the former things, what they [be,]that we may consider them, and know the latter end of them; or declareus things for to come. 

{41:23} Shew the things that are to comehereafter, that we may know that ye [are] gods: yea, do good, or doevil, that we may be dismayed, and behold [it] together. 

{41:24}Behold, ye [are] of nothing, and your work of nought: an abomination[is he that] chooseth you. 

{41:25} I have raised up [one] from thenorth, and he shall come: from the rising of the sun shall he call uponmy name: and he shall come upon princes as [upon] morter, and as thepotter treadeth clay. 

{41:26} Who hath declared from the beginning,that we may know? and beforetime, that we may say, [He is] righteous?yea, [there is] none that sheweth, yea, [there is] none that declareth,yea, [there is] none that heareth your words. 

{41:27} The first [shallsay] to Zion, Behold, behold them: and I will give to Jerusalem onethat bringeth good tidings. 

{41:28} For I beheld, and [there was] noman; even among them, and [there was] no counsellor, that, when I askedof them, could answer a word. 

{41:29} Behold, they [are] all vanity;their works [are] nothing: their molten images [are] wind and confusion.   

{42:1} Behold my servant, whom I uphold; mine elect, [in whom] mysoul delighteth; I have put my spirit upon him: he shall bring forthjudgment to the Gentiles. 

{42:2} He shall not cry, nor lift up, norcause his voice to be heard in the street. 

{42:3} A bruised reed shallhe not break, and the smoking flax shall he not quench: he shall bringforth judgment unto truth. 

{42:4} He shall not fail nor be discouraged,till he have set judgment in the earth: and the isles shall wait forhis law.   

{42:5} Thus saith God the LORD, he that created the heavens, andstretched them out; he that spread forth the earth, and that whichcometh out of it; he that giveth breath unto the people upon it, andspirit to them that walk therein: 

{42:6} I the LORD have called thee inrighteousness, and will hold thine hand, and will keep thee, and givethee for a covenant of the people, for a light of the Gentiles; 

{42:7}To open the blind eyes, to bring out the prisoners from the prison,[and] them that sit in darkness out of the prison house. 

{42:8} I [am]the LORD: that [is] my name: and my glory will I not give to another,neither my praise to graven images. 

{42:9} Behold, the former thingsare come to pass, and new things do I declare: before they spring forthI tell you of them. 

{42:10} Sing unto the LORD a new song, [and] hispraise from the end of the earth, ye that go down to the sea, and allthat is therein; the isles, and the inhabitants thereof. 

{42:11} Letthe wilderness and the cities thereof lift up [their voice,] thevillages [that] Kedar doth inhabit: let the inhabitants of the rocksing, let them shout from the top of the mountains. 

{42:12} Let themgive glory unto the LORD, and declare his praise in the islands.

{42:13} The LORD shall go forth as a mighty man, he shall stir upjealousy like a man of war: he shall cry, yea, roar; he shall prevailagainst his enemies. 

{42:14} I have long time holden my peace; I havebeen still, [and] refrained myself: [now] will I cry like a travailingwoman; I will destroy and devour at once. 

{42:15} I will make wastemountains and hills, and dry up all their herbs; and I will make therivers islands, and I will dry up the pools. 

{42:16} And I will bringthe blind by a way [that] they knew not; I will lead them in paths[that] they have not known: I will make darkness light before them, andcrooked things straight. These things will I do unto them, and notforsake them.   

{42:17} They shall be turned back, they shall be greatly ashamed,that trust in graven images, that say to the molten images, Ye [are]our gods. 

{42:18} Hear, ye deaf; and look, ye blind, that ye may see.

{42:19} Who [is] blind, but my servant? or deaf, as my messenger [that]I sent? who [is] blind as [he that is] perfect, and blind as the LORD'Sservant? 

{42:20} Seeing many things, but thou observest not; openingthe ears, but he heareth not. 

{42:21} The LORD is well pleased for hisrighteousness' sake; he will magnify the law, and make [it] honourable.

{42:22} But this [is] a people robbed and spoiled; [they are] all ofthem snared in holes, and they are hid in prison houses: they are for aprey, and none delivereth; for a spoil, and none saith, Restore.

{42:23} Who among you will give ear to this? [who] will hearken andhear for the time to come? 

{42:24} Who gave Jacob for a spoil, andIsrael to the robbers? did not the LORD, he against whom we havesinned? for they would not walk in his ways, neither were they obedientunto his law. 

{42:25} Therefore he hath poured upon him the fury of hisanger, and the strength of battle: and it hath set him on fire roundabout, yet he knew not; and it burned him, yet he laid [it] not toheart.   

{43:1} But now thus saith the LORD that created thee, O Jacob, andhe that formed thee, O Israel, Fear not: for I have redeemed thee, Ihave called [thee] by thy name; thou [art] mine. 

{43:2} When thoupassest through the waters, I [will be] with thee; and through therivers, they shall not overflow thee: when thou walkest through thefire, thou shalt not be burned; neither shall the flame kindle uponthee. 

{43:3} For I [am] the LORD thy God, the Holy One of Israel, thySaviour: I gave Egypt [for] thy ransom, Ethiopia and Seba for thee.

{43:4} Since thou wast precious in my sight, thou hast been honourable,and I have loved thee: therefore will I give men for thee, and peoplefor thy life. 

{43:5} Fear not: for I [am] with thee: I will bring thyseed from the east, and gather thee from the west; 

{43:6} I will say tothe north, Give up; and to the south, Keep not back: bring my sons fromfar, and my daughters from the ends of the earth; 

{43:7} [Even] everyone that is called by my name: for I have created him for my glory, Ihave formed him; yea, I have made him.   

{43:8} Bring forth the blind people that have eyes, and the deafthat have ears. 

{43:9} Let all the nations be gathered together, andlet the people be assembled: who among them can declare this, and shewus former things? let them bring forth their witnesses, that they maybe justified: or let them hear, and say, [It is] truth. 

{43:10} Ye[are] my witnesses, saith the LORD, and my servant whom I have chosen:that ye may know and believe me, and understand that I [am] he: beforeme there was no God formed, neither shall there be after me. 

{43:11} I,[even] I, [am] the LORD; and beside me [there is] no saviour. 

{43:12} Ihave declared, and have saved, and I have shewed, when [there was] nostrange [god] among you: therefore ye [are] my witnesses, saith theLORD, that I [am] God. 

{43:13} Yea, before the day [was] I [am] he; and[there is] none that can deliver out of my hand: I will work, and whoshall let it?   

{43:14} Thus saith the LORD, your redeemer, the Holy One of Israel;For your sake I have sent to Babylon, and have brought down all theirnobles, and the Chaldeans, whose cry [is] in the ships. 

{43:15} I [am]the LORD, your Holy One, the creator of Israel, your King. 

{43:16} Thussaith the LORD, which maketh a way in the sea, and a path in the mightywaters; 

{43:17} Which bringeth forth the chariot and horse, the armyand the power; they shall lie down together, they shall not rise: theyare extinct, they are quenched as tow.   

{43:18} Remember ye not the former things, neither consider thethings of old. 

{43:19} Behold, I will do a new thing; now it shallspring forth; shall ye not know it? I will even make a way in thewilderness, [and] rivers in the desert. 

{43:20} The beast of the fieldshall honour me, the dragons and the owls: because I give waters in thewilderness, [and] rivers in the desert, to give drink to my people, mychosen. 

{43:21} This people have I formed for myself; they shall shewforth my praise.   

{43:22} But thou hast not called upon me, O Jacob; but thou hastbeen weary of me, O Israel. 

{43:23} Thou hast not brought me the smallcattle of thy burnt offerings; neither hast thou honoured me with thysacrifices. I have not caused thee to serve with an offering, norwearied thee with incense. 

{43:24} Thou hast bought me no sweet canewith money, neither hast thou filled me with the fat of thy sacrifices:but thou hast made me to serve with thy sins, thou hast wearied me withthine iniquities. 

{43:25} I, [even] I, [am] he that blotteth out thytransgressions for mine own sake, and will not remember thy sins.

{43:26} Put me in remembrance: let us plead together: declare thou,that thou mayest be justified. 

{43:27} Thy first father hath sinned,and thy teachers have transgressed against me. 

{43:28} Therefore I haveprofaned the princes of the sanctuary, and have given Jacob to thecurse, and Israel to reproaches.   

{44:1} Yet now hear, O Jacob my servant; and Israel, whom I havechosen: 

{44:2} Thus saith the LORD that made thee, and formed thee fromthe womb, [which] will help thee; Fear not, O Jacob, my servant; andthou, Jesurun, whom I have chosen. 

{44:3} For I will pour water uponhim that is thirsty, and floods upon the dry ground: I will pour myspirit upon thy seed, and my blessing upon thine offspring: 

{44:4} Andthey shall spring up as among the grass, as willows by the watercourses. 

{44:5} One shall say, I [am] the LORD'S; and another shallcall [himself] by the name of Jacob; and another shall subscribe [with]his hand unto the LORD, and surname [himself] by the name of Israel.

{44:6} Thus saith the LORD the King of Israel, and his redeemer theLORD of hosts; I [am] the first, and I [am] the last; and beside me[there is] no God. 

{44:7} And who, as I, shall call, and shall declareit, and set it in order for me, since I appointed the ancient people?and the things that are coming, and shall come, let them shew untothem. 

{44:8} Fear ye not, neither be afraid: have not I told thee fromthat time, and have declared [it?] ye [are] even my witnesses. Is therea God beside me? yea, [there is] no God; I know not [any.]   

{44:9} They that make a graven image [are] all of them vanity; andtheir delectable things shall not profit; and they [are] their ownwitnesses; they see not, nor know; that they may be ashamed. 

{44:10}Who hath formed a god, or molten a graven image [that] is profitablefor nothing? 

{44:11} Behold, all his fellows shall be ashamed: and theworkmen, they [are] of men: let them all be gathered together, let themstand up; [yet] they shall fear, [and] they shall be ashamed together.

{44:12} The smith with the tongs both worketh in the coals, andfashioneth it with hammers, and worketh it with the strength of hisarms: yea, he is hungry, and his strength faileth: he drinketh nowater, and is faint. 

{44:13} The carpenter stretcheth out [his] rule;he marketh it out with a line; he fitteth it with planes, and hemarketh it out with the compass, and maketh it after the figure of aman, according to the beauty of a man; that it may remain in the house.

{44:14} He heweth him down cedars, and taketh the cypress and the oak,which he strengtheneth for himself among the trees of the forest: heplanteth an ash, and the rain doth nourish [it. ]

{44:15} Then shall itbe for a man to burn: for he will take thereof, and warm himself; yea,he kindleth [it,] and baketh bread; yea, he maketh a god, andworshippeth [it;] he maketh it a graven image, and falleth downthereto. 

{44:16} He burneth part thereof in the fire; with part thereofhe eateth flesh; he roasteth roast, and is satisfied: yea, he warmeth[himself,] and saith, Aha, I am warm, I have seen the fire: 

{44:17} Andthe residue thereof he maketh a god, [even] his graven image: hefalleth down unto it, and worshippeth [it,] and prayeth unto it, andsaith, Deliver me; for thou [art] my god. 

{44:18} They have not knownnor understood: for he hath shut their eyes, that they cannot see;[and] their hearts, that they cannot understand. 

{44:19} And noneconsidereth in his heart, neither [is there] knowledge norunderstanding to say, I have burned part of it in the fire; yea, also Ihave baked bread upon the coals thereof; I have roasted flesh, andeaten [it:] and shall I make the residue thereof an abomination? shallI fall down to the stock of a tree? 

{44:20} He feedeth on ashes: adeceived heart hath turned him aside, that he cannot deliver his soul,nor say, [Is there] not a lie in my right hand?   

{44:21} Remember these, O Jacob and Israel; for thou [art] myservant: I have formed thee; thou [art] my servant: O Israel, thoushalt not be forgotten of me. 

{44:22} I have blotted out, as a thickcloud, thy transgressions, and, as a cloud, thy sins: return unto me;for I have redeemed thee. 

{44:23} Sing, O ye heavens; for the LORD hathdone [it:] shout, ye lower parts of the earth: break forth intosinging, ye mountains, O forest, and every tree therein: for the LORDhath redeemed Jacob, and glorified himself in Israel. 

{44:24} Thussaith the LORD, thy redeemer, and he that formed thee from the womb, I[am] the LORD that maketh all [things;] that stretcheth forth theheavens alone; that spreadeth abroad the earth by myself; 

{44:25} Thatfrustrateth the tokens of the liars, and maketh diviners mad; thatturneth wise [men] backward, and maketh their knowledge foolish;

{44:26} That confirmeth the word of his servant, and performeth thecounsel of his messengers; that saith to Jerusalem, Thou shalt beinhabited; and to the cities of Judah, Ye shall be built, and I willraise up the decayed places thereof: 

{44:27} That saith to the deep, Bedry, and I will dry up thy rivers: 

{44:28} That saith of Cyrus, [He is]my shepherd, and shall perform all my pleasure: even saying toJerusalem, Thou shalt be built; and to the temple, Thy foundation shallbe laid.   

{45:1} Thus saith the LORD to his anointed, to Cyrus, whose righthand I have holden, to subdue nations before him; and I will loose theloins of kings, to open before him the two leaved gates; and the gatesshall not be shut; 

{45:2} I will go before thee, and make the crookedplaces straight: I will break in pieces the gates of brass, and cut insunder the bars of iron: 

{45:3} And I will give thee the treasures ofdarkness, and hidden riches of secret places, that thou mayest knowthat I, the LORD, which call [thee] by thy name, [am] the God ofIsrael. 

{45:4} For Jacob my servant's sake, and Israel mine elect, Ihave even called thee by thy name: I have surnamed thee, though thouhast not known me.   

{45:5} I [am] the LORD, and [there is] none else, [there is] no Godbeside me: I girded thee, though thou hast not known me: 

{45:6} Thatthey may know from the rising of the sun, and from the west, that[there is] none beside me. I [am] the LORD, and [there is] none else.

{45:7} I form the light, and create darkness: I make peace, and createevil: I the LORD do all these [things. ]

{45:8} Drop down, ye heavens,from above, and let the skies pour down righteousness: let the earthopen, and let them bring forth salvation, and let righteousness springup together; I the LORD have created it. 

{45:9} Woe unto him thatstriveth with his Maker! [Let] the potsherd [strive] with the potsherdsof the earth. Shall the clay say to him that fashioneth it, What makestthou? or thy work, He hath no hands? 

{45:10} Woe unto him that saithunto [his] father, What begettest thou? or to the woman, What hast thoubrought forth? 

{45:11} Thus saith the LORD, the Holy One of Israel, andhis Maker, Ask me of things to come concerning my sons, and concerningthe work of my hands command ye me. 

{45:12} I have made the earth, andcreated man upon it: I, [even] my hands, have stretched out theheavens, and all their host have I commanded. 

{45:13} I have raised himup in righteousness, and I will direct all his ways: he shall build mycity, and he shall let go my captives, not for price nor reward, saiththe LORD of hosts. 

{45:14} Thus saith the LORD, The labour of Egypt,and merchandise of Ethiopia and of the Sabeans, men of stature, shallcome over unto thee, and they shall be thine: they shall come afterthee; in chains they shall come over, and they shall fall down untothee, they shall make supplication unto thee, [saying,] Surely God [is]in thee; and [there is] none else, [there is] no God. 

{45:15} Verilythou [art] a God that hidest thyself, O God of Israel, the Saviour.

{45:16} They shall be ashamed, and also confounded, all of them: theyshall go to confusion together [that are] makers of idols. 

{45:17}[But] Israel shall be saved in the LORD with an everlasting salvation:ye shall not be ashamed nor confounded world without end. 

{45:18} Forthus saith the LORD that created the heavens; God himself that formedthe earth and made it; he hath established it, he created it not invain, he formed it to be inhabited: I [am] the LORD; and [there is]none else. 

{45:19} I have not spoken in secret, in a dark place of theearth: I said not unto the seed of Jacob, Seek ye me in vain: I theLORD speak righteousness, I declare things that are right.   

{45:20} Assemble yourselves and come; draw near together, ye [thatare] escaped of the nations: they have no knowledge that set up thewood of their graven image, and pray unto a god [that] cannot save.

{45:21} Tell ye, and bring [them] near; yea, let them take counseltogether: who hath declared this from ancient time? [who] hath told itfrom that time? [have] not I the LORD? and [there is] no God elsebeside me; a just God and a Saviour; [there is] none beside me. 

{45:22}Look unto me, and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth: for I [am]God, and [there is] none else. 

{45:23} I have sworn by myself, the wordis gone out of my mouth [in] righteousness, and shall not return, Thatunto me every knee shall bow, every tongue shall swear. 

{45:24} Surely,shall [one] say, in the LORD have I righteousness and strength: [even]to him shall [men] come; and all that are incensed against him shall beashamed. 

{45:25} In the LORD shall all the seed of Israel be justified,and shall glory.   

{46:1} Bel boweth down, Nebo stoopeth, their idols were upon thebeasts, and upon the cattle: your carriages [were] heavy loaden; [theyare] a burden to the weary [beast. ]

{46:2} They stoop, they bow downtogether; they could not deliver the burden, but themselves are goneinto captivity. 

{46:3} Hearken unto me, O house of Jacob, and all theremnant of the house of Israel, which are borne [by me] from the belly,which are carried from the womb: 

{46:4} And [even] to [your] old age I[am] he; and [even] to hoar hairs will I carry [you:] I have made, andI will bear; even I will carry, and will deliver [you.]   

{46:5} To whom will ye liken me, and make [me] equal, and compareme, that we may be like? 

{46:6} They lavish gold out of the bag, andweigh silver in the balance, [and] hire a goldsmith; and he maketh it agod: they fall down, yea, they worship. 

{46:7} They bear him upon theshoulder, they carry him, and set him in his place, and he standeth;from his place shall he not remove: yea, [one] shall cry unto him, yetcan he not answer, nor save him out of his trouble. 

{46:8} Rememberthis, and shew yourselves men: bring it again to mind, O yetransgressors. 

{46:9} Remember the former things of old: for I [am]God, and [there is] none else; [I am] God, and [there is] none like me,

{46:10} Declaring the end from the beginning, and from ancient times[the things] that are not [yet] done, saying, My counsel shall stand,and I will do all my pleasure: 

{46:11} Calling a ravenous bird from theeast, the man that executeth my counsel from a far country: yea, I havespoken [it,] I will also bring it to pass; I have purposed [it,] I willalso do it.   

{46:12} Hearken unto me, ye stouthearted, that [are] far fromrighteousness: 

{46:13} I bring near my righteousness; it shall not befar off, and my salvation shall not tarry: and I will place salvationin Zion for Israel my glory.   

{47:1} Come down, and sit in the dust, O virgin daughter of Babylon,sit on the ground: [there is] no throne, O daughter of the Chaldeans:for thou shalt no more be called tender and delicate. 

{47:2} Take themillstones, and grind meal: uncover thy locks, make bare the leg,uncover the thigh, pass over the rivers. 

{47:3} Thy nakedness shall beuncovered, yea, thy shame shall be seen: I will take vengeance, and Iwill not meet [thee as] a man. 

{47:4} [As for] our redeemer, the LORDof hosts [is] his name, the Holy One of Israel. 

{47:5} Sit thou silent,and get thee into darkness, O daughter of the Chaldeans: for thou shaltno more be called, The lady of kingdoms.   

{47:6} I was wroth with my people, I have polluted mine inheritance,and given them into thine hand: thou didst shew them no mercy; upon theancient hast thou very heavily laid thy yoke.   

{47:7} And thou saidst, I shall be a lady for ever: [so] that thoudidst not lay these [things] to thy heart, neither didst remember thelatter end of it. 

{47:8} Therefore hear now this, [thou that art] givento pleasures, that dwellest carelessly, that sayest in thine heart, I[am,] and none else beside me; I shall not sit [as] a widow, neithershall I know the loss of children: 

{47:9} But these two [things] shallcome to thee in a moment in one day, the loss of children, andwidowhood: they shall come upon thee in their perfection for themultitude of thy sorceries, [and] for the great abundance of thineenchantments.   

{47:10} For thou hast trusted in thy wickedness: thou hast said,None seeth me. Thy wisdom and thy knowledge, it hath perverted thee;and thou hast said in thine heart, I [am,] and none else beside me.   

{47:11} Therefore shall evil come upon thee; thou shalt not knowfrom whence it riseth: and mischief shall fall upon thee; thou shaltnot be able to put if off: and desolation shall come upon theesuddenly, [which] thou shalt not know. 

{47:12} Stand now with thineenchantments, and with the multitude of thy sorceries, wherein thouhast laboured from thy youth; if so be thou shalt be able to profit, ifso be thou mayest prevail. 

{47:13} Thou art wearied in the multitude ofthy counsels. Let now the astrologers, the stargazers, the monthlyprognosticators, stand up, and save thee from [these things] that shallcome upon thee. 

{47:14} Behold, they shall be as stubble; the fireshall burn them; they shall not deliver themselves from the power ofthe flame: [there shall] not [be] a coal to warm at, [nor] fire to sitbefore it. 

{47:15} Thus shall they be unto thee with whom thou hastlaboured, [even] thy merchants, from thy youth: they shall wander everyone to his quarter; none shall save thee.   

{48:1} Hear ye this, O house of Jacob, which are called by the nameof Israel, and are come forth out of the waters of Judah, which swearby the name of the LORD, and make mention of the God of Israel, [but]not in truth, nor in righteousness. 

{48:2} For they call themselves ofthe holy city, and stay themselves upon the God of Israel; The LORD ofhosts [is] his name. 

{48:3} I have declared the former things from thebeginning; and they went forth out of my mouth, and I shewed them; Idid [them] suddenly, and they came to pass. 

{48:4} Because I knew thatthou [art] obstinate, and thy neck [is] an iron sinew, and thy browbrass; 

{48:5} I have even from the beginning declared [it] to thee;before it came to pass I shewed [it] thee: lest thou shouldest say,Mine idol hath done them, and my graven image, and my molten image,hath commanded them. 

{48:6} Thou hast heard, see all this; and will notye declare [it?] I have shewed thee new things from this time, evenhidden things, and thou didst not know them. 

{48:7} They are creatednow, and not from the beginning; even before the day when thou heardestthem not; lest thou shouldest say, Behold, I knew them. 

{48:8} Yea,thou heardest not; yea, thou knewest not; yea, from that time [that]thine ear was not opened: for I knew that thou wouldest deal verytreacherously, and wast called a transgressor from the womb.   

{48:9} For my name's sake will I defer mine anger, and for my praisewill I refrain for thee, that I cut thee not off. 

{48:10} Behold, Ihave refined thee, but not with silver; I have chosen thee in thefurnace of affliction. 

{48:11} For mine own sake, [even] for mine ownsake, will I do [it:] for how should [my name] be polluted? and I willnot give my glory unto another.   

{48:12} Hearken unto me, O Jacob and Israel, my called; I [am] he; I[am] the first, I also [am] the last. 

{48:13} Mine hand also hath laidthe foundation of the earth, and my right hand hath spanned theheavens: [when] I call unto them, they stand up together. 

{48:14} Allye, assemble yourselves, and hear; which among them hath declared these[things?] The LORD hath loved him: he will do his pleasure on Babylon,and his arm [shall be on] the Chaldeans. 

{48:15} I, [even] I, havespoken; yea, I have called him: I have brought him, and he shall makehis way prosperous.   

{48:16} Come ye near unto me, hear ye this; I have not spoken insecret from the beginning; from the time that it was, there [am] I: andnow the Lord GOD, and his Spirit, hath sent me. 

{48:17} Thus saith theLORD, thy Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel; I [am] the LORD thy Godwhich teacheth thee to profit, which leadeth thee by the way [that]thou shouldest go. 

{48:18} O that thou hadst hearkened to mycommandments! then had thy peace been as a river, and thy righteousnessas the waves of the sea: 

{48:19} Thy seed also had been as the sand,and the offspring of thy bowels like the gravel thereof; his nameshould not have been cut off nor destroyed from before me.   

{48:20} Go ye forth of Babylon, flee ye from the Chaldeans, with avoice of singing declare ye, tell this, utter it [even] to the end ofthe earth; say ye, The LORD hath redeemed his servant Jacob. 

{48:21}And they thirsted not [when] he led them through the deserts: he causedthe waters to flow out of the rock for them: he clave the rock also,and the waters gushed out. 

{48:22} [There is] no peace, saith the LORD,unto the wicked.   

{49:1} Listen, O isles, unto me; and hearken, ye people, from far;The LORD hath called me from the womb; from the bowels of my motherhath he made mention of my name. 

{49:2} And he hath made my mouth likea sharp sword; in the shadow of his hand hath he hid me, and made me apolished shaft; in his quiver hath he hid me; 

{49:3} And said unto me,Thou [art] my servant, O Israel, in whom I will be glorified. 

{49:4}Then I said, I have laboured in vain, I have spent my strength fornought, and in vain: [yet] surely my judgment [is] with the LORD, andmy work with my God.   

{49:5} And now, saith the LORD that formed me from the womb [to be]his servant, to bring Jacob again to him, Though Israel be notgathered, yet shall I be glorious in the eyes of the LORD, and my Godshall be my strength. 

{49:6} And he said, It is a light thing that thoushouldest be my servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob, and to restorethe preserved of Israel: I will also give thee for a light to theGentiles, that thou mayest be my salvation unto the end of the earth.

{49:7} Thus saith the LORD, the Redeemer of Israel, [and] his Holy One,to him whom man despiseth, to him whom the nation abhorreth, to aservant of rulers, Kings shall see and arise, princes also shallworship, because of the LORD that is faithful, [and] the Holy One ofIsrael, and he shall choose thee. 

{49:8} Thus saith the LORD, In anacceptable time have I heard thee, and in a day of salvation have Ihelped thee: and I will preserve thee, and give thee for a covenant ofthe people, to establish the earth, to cause to inherit the desolateheritages; 

{49:9} That thou mayest say to the prisoners, Go forth; tothem that [are] in darkness, Shew yourselves. They shall feed in theways, and their pastures [shall be] in all high places. 

{49:10} Theyshall not hunger nor thirst; neither shall the heat nor sun smite them:for he that hath mercy on them shall lead them, even by the springs ofwater shall he guide them. 

{49:11} And I will make all my mountains away, and my highways shall be exalted. 

{49:12} Behold, these shall comefrom far: and, lo, these from the north and from the west; and thesefrom the land of Sinim.   

{49:13} Sing, O heavens; and be joyful, O earth; and break forthinto singing, O mountains: for the LORD hath comforted his people, andwill have mercy upon his afflicted. 

{49:14} But Zion said, The LORDhath forsaken me, and my Lord hath forgotten me. 

{49:15} Can a womanforget her sucking child, that she should not have compassion on theson of her womb? yea, they may forget, yet will I not forget thee.

{49:16} Behold, I have graven thee upon the palms of [my] hands; thywalls [are] continually before me. 

{49:17} Thy children shall makehaste; thy destroyers and they that made thee waste shall go forth ofthee.   

{49:18} Lift up thine eyes round about, and behold: all these gatherthemselves together, [and] come to thee. [As] I live, saith the LORD,thou shalt surely clothe thee with them all, as with an ornament, andbind them [on thee,] as a bride [doeth. ]

{49:19} For thy waste and thydesolate places, and the land of thy destruction, shall even now be toonarrow by reason of the inhabitants, and they that swallowed thee upshall be far away. 

{49:20} The children which thou shalt have, afterthou hast lost the other, shall say again in thine ears, The place [is]too strait for me: give place to me that I may dwell. 

{49:21} Thenshalt thou say in thine heart, Who hath begotten me these, seeing Ihave lost my children, and am desolate, a captive, and removing to andfro? and who hath brought up these? Behold, I was left alone; these,where [had] they [been? ]

{49:22} Thus saith the Lord GOD, Behold, Iwill lift up mine hand to the Gentiles, and set up my standard to thepeople: and they shall bring thy sons in [their] arms, and thydaughters shall be carried upon [their] shoulders. 

{49:23} And kingsshall be thy nursing fathers, and their queens thy nursing mothers:they shall bow down to thee with [their] face toward the earth, andlick up the dust of thy feet; and thou shalt know that I [am] the LORD:for they shall not be ashamed that wait for me.   

{49:24} Shall the prey be taken from the mighty, or the lawfulcaptive delivered? 

{49:25} But thus saith the LORD, Even the captivesof the mighty shall be taken away, and the prey of the terrible shallbe delivered: for I will contend with him that contendeth with thee,and I will save thy children. 

{49:26} And I will feed them that oppressthee with their own flesh; and they shall be drunken with their ownblood, as with sweet wine: and all flesh shall know that I the LORD[am] thy Saviour and thy Redeemer, the mighty One of Jacob.   

{50:1} Thus saith the LORD, Where [is] the bill of your mother'sdivorcement, whom I have put away? or which of my creditors [is it] towhom I have sold you? Behold, for your iniquities have ye soldyourselves, and for your transgressions is your mother put away. 

{50:2}Wherefore, when I came, [was there] no man? when I called, [was there]none to answer? Is my hand shortened at all, that it cannot redeem? orhave I no power to deliver? behold, at my rebuke I dry up the sea, Imake the rivers a wilderness: their fish stinketh, because [there is]no water, and dieth for thirst. 

{50:3} I clothe the heavens withblackness, and I make sackcloth their covering. 

{50:4} The Lord GODhath given me the tongue of the learned, that I should know how tospeak a word in season to [him that is] weary: he wakeneth morning bymorning, he wakeneth mine ear to hear as the learned.   

{50:5} The Lord GOD hath opened mine ear, and I was not rebellious,neither turned away back. 

{50:6} I gave my back to the smiters, and mycheeks to them that plucked off the hair: I hid not my face from shameand spitting.   

{50:7} For the Lord GOD will help me; therefore shall I not beconfounded: therefore have I set my face like a flint, and I know thatI shall not be ashamed. 

{50:8} [He is] near that justifieth me; whowill contend with me? let us stand together: who [is] mine adversary?let him come near to me. 

{50:9} Behold, the Lord GOD will help me; who[is] he [that] shall condemn me? lo, they all shall wax old as agarment; the moth shall eat them up.   

{50:10} Who [is] among you that feareth the LORD, that obeyeth thevoice of his servant, that walketh [in] darkness, and hath no light?let him trust in the name of the LORD, and stay upon his God. 

{50:11}Behold, all ye that kindle a fire, that compass [yourselves] about withsparks: walk in the light of your fire, and in the sparks [that] yehave kindled. This shall ye have of mine hand; ye shall lie down insorrow.   

{51:1} Hearken to me, ye that follow after righteousness, ye thatseek the LORD: look unto the rock [whence] ye are hewn, and to the holeof the pit [whence] ye are digged. 

{51:2} Look unto Abraham yourfather, and unto Sarah [that] bare you: for I called him alone, andblessed him, and increased him. 

{51:3} For the LORD shall comfort Zion:he will comfort all her waste places; and he will make her wildernesslike Eden, and her desert like the garden of the LORD; joy and gladnessshall be found therein, thanksgiving, and the voice of melody.   

{51:4} Hearken unto me, my people; and give ear unto me, O mynation: for a law shall proceed from me, and I will make my judgment torest for a light of the people. 

{51:5} My righteousness [is] near; mysalvation is gone forth, and mine arms shall judge the people; theisles shall wait upon me, and on mine arm shall they trust. 

{51:6} Liftup your eyes to the heavens, and look upon the earth beneath: for theheavens shall vanish away like smoke, and the earth shall wax old likea garment, and they that dwell therein shall die in like manner: but mysalvation shall be for ever, and my righteousness shall not beabolished.   

{51:7} Hearken unto me, ye that know righteousness, the people inwhose heart [is] my law; fear ye not the reproach of men, neither be yeafraid of their revilings. 

{51:8} For the moth shall eat them up like agarment, and the worm shall eat them like wool: but my righteousnessshall be for ever, and my salvation from generation to generation.   

{51:9} Awake, awake, put on strength, O arm of the LORD; awake, asin the ancient days, in the generations of old. [Art] thou not it thathath cut Rahab, [and] wounded the dragon? 

{51:10} [Art] thou not itwhich hath dried the sea, the waters of the great deep; that hath madethe depths of the sea a way for the ransomed to pass over? 

{51:11}Therefore the redeemed of the LORD shall return, and come with singingunto Zion; and everlasting joy [shall be] upon their head: they shallobtain gladness and joy; [and] sorrow and mourning shall flee away.

{51:12} I, [even] I, [am] he that comforteth you: who [art] thou, thatthou shouldest be afraid of a man [that] shall die, and of the son ofman [which] shall be made as grass; 

{51:13} And forgettest the LORD thymaker, that hath stretched forth the heavens, and laid the foundationsof the earth; and hast feared continually every day because of the furyof the oppressor, as if he were ready to destroy? and where [is] thefury of the oppressor? 

{51:14} The captive exile hasteneth that he maybe loosed, and that he should not die in the pit, nor that his breadshould fail. 

{51:15} But I [am] the LORD thy God, that divided the sea,whose waves roared: The LORD of hosts [is] his name. 

{51:16} And I haveput my words in thy mouth, and I have covered thee in the shadow ofmine hand, that I may plant the heavens, and lay the foundations of theearth, and say unto Zion, Thou [art] my people.   

{51:17} Awake, awake, stand up, O Jerusalem, which hast drunk at thehand of the LORD the cup of his fury; thou hast drunken the dregs ofthe cup of trembling, [and] wrung [them] out. 

{51:18} [There is] noneto guide her among all the sons [whom] she hath brought forth; neither[is there any] that taketh her by the hand of all the sons [that] shehath brought up. 

{51:19} These two [things] are come unto thee; whoshall be sorry for thee? desolation, and destruction, and the famine,and the sword: by whom shall I comfort thee? 

{51:20} Thy sons havefainted, they lie at the head of all the streets, as a wild bull in anet: they are full of the fury of the LORD, the rebuke of thy God.   

{51:21} Therefore hear now this, thou afflicted, and drunken, butnot with wine: 

{51:22} Thus saith thy Lord the LORD, and thy God [that]pleadeth the cause of his people, Behold, I have taken out of thinehand the cup of trembling, [even] the dregs of the cup of my fury; thoushalt no more drink it again: 

{51:23} But I will put it into the handof them that afflict thee; which have said to thy soul, Bow down, thatwe may go over: and thou hast laid thy body as the ground, and as thestreet, to them that went over.   

{52:1} Awake, awake; put on thy strength, O Zion; put on thybeautiful garments, O Jerusalem, the holy city: for henceforth thereshall no more come into thee the uncircumcised and the unclean. 

{52:2}Shake thyself from the dust; arise, [and] sit down, O Jerusalem: loosethyself from the bands of thy neck, O captive daughter of Zion. 

{52:3}For thus saith the LORD, Ye have sold yourselves for nought; and yeshall be redeemed without money. 

{52:4} For thus saith the Lord GOD, Mypeople went down aforetime into Egypt to sojourn there; and theAssyrian oppressed them without cause. 

{52:5} Now therefore, what haveI here, saith the LORD, that my people is taken away for nought? theythat rule over them make them to howl, saith the LORD; and my namecontinually every day is blasphemed. 

{52:6} Therefore my people shallknow my name: therefore [they shall know] in that day that I [am] hethat doth speak: behold, [it is] I.   

{52:7} How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him thatbringeth good tidings, that publisheth peace; that bringeth goodtidings of good, that publisheth salvation; that saith unto Zion, ThyGod reigneth! 

{52:8} Thy watchmen shall lift up the voice; with thevoice together shall they sing: for they shall see eye to eye, when theLORD shall bring again Zion.   

{52:9} Break forth into joy, sing together, ye waste places ofJerusalem: for the LORD hath comforted his people, he hath redeemedJerusalem. 

{52:10} The LORD hath made bare his holy arm in the eyes ofall the nations; and all the ends of the earth shall see the salvationof our God.   

{52:11} Depart ye, depart ye, go ye out from thence, touch nounclean [thing;] go ye out of the midst of her; be ye clean, that bearthe vessels of the LORD. 

{52:12} For ye shall not go out with haste,nor go by flight: for the LORD will go before you; and the God ofIsrael [will be] your rereward.   

{52:13} Behold, my servant shall deal prudently, he shall be exaltedand extolled, and be very high. 

{52:14} As many were astonied at thee;his visage was so marred more than any man, and his form more than thesons of men: 

{52:15} So shall he sprinkle many nations; the kings shallshut their mouths at him: for [that] which had not been told them shallthey see; and [that] which they had not heard shall they consider.   

{53:1} Who hath believed our report? and to whom is the arm of theLORD revealed? 

{53:2} For he shall grow up before him as a tenderplant, and as a root out of a dry ground: he hath no form norcomeliness; and when we shall see him, [there is] no beauty that weshould desire him. 

{53:3} He is despised and rejected of men; a man ofsorrows, and acquainted with grief: and we hid as it were [our] facesfrom him; he was despised, and we esteemed him not.   

{53:4} Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows: yetwe did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted. 

{53:5} Buthe [was] wounded for our transgressions, [he was] bruised for ouriniquities: the chastisement of our peace [was] upon him; and with hisstripes we are healed. 

{53:6} All we like sheep have gone astray; wehave turned every one to his own way; and the LORD hath laid on him theiniquity of us all. 

{53:7} He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yethe opened not his mouth: he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, andas a sheep before her shearers is dumb, so he openeth not his mouth.

{53:8} He was taken from prison and from judgment: and who shalldeclare his generation? for he was cut off out of the land of theliving: for the transgression of my people was he stricken. 

{53:9} Andhe made his grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his death;because he had done no violence, neither [was any] deceit in his mouth.   

{53:10} Yet it pleased the LORD to bruise him; he hath put [him] togrief: when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin, he shall see[his] seed, he shall prolong [his] days, and the pleasure of the LORDshall prosper in his hand. 

{53:11} He shall see of the travail of hissoul, [and] shall be satisfied: by his knowledge shall my righteousservant justify many; for he shall bear their iniquities. 

{53:12}Therefore will I divide him [a portion] with the great, and he shalldivide the spoil with the strong; because he hath poured out his soulunto death: and he was numbered with the transgressors; and he bare thesin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors.   

{54:1} Sing, O barren, thou [that] didst not bear; break forth intosinging, and cry aloud, thou [that] didst not travail with child: formore [are] the children of the desolate than the children of themarried wife, saith the LORD. 

{54:2} Enlarge the place of thy tent, andlet them stretch forth the curtains of thine habitations: spare not,lengthen thy cords, and strengthen thy stakes; 

{54:3} For thou shaltbreak forth on the right hand and on the left; and thy seed shallinherit the Gentiles, and make the desolate cities to be inhabited.

{54:4} Fear not; for thou shalt not be ashamed: neither be thouconfounded; for thou shalt not be put to shame: for thou shalt forgetthe shame of thy youth, and shalt not remember the reproach of thywidowhood any more. 

{54:5} For thy Maker [is] thine husband; the LORDof hosts [is] his name; and thy Redeemer the Holy One of Israel; TheGod of the whole earth shall he be called. 

{54:6} For the LORD hathcalled thee as a woman forsaken and grieved in spirit, and a wife ofyouth, when thou wast refused, saith thy God. 

{54:7} For a small momenthave I forsaken thee; but with great mercies will I gather thee. 

{54:8}In a little wrath I hid my face from thee for a moment; but witheverlasting kindness will I have mercy on thee, saith the LORD thyRedeemer. 

{54:9} For this [is as] the waters of Noah unto me: for [as]I have sworn that the waters of Noah should no more go over the earth;so have I sworn that I would not be wroth with thee, nor rebuke thee.

{54:10} For the mountains shall depart, and the hills be removed; butmy kindness shall not depart from thee, neither shall the covenant ofmy peace be removed, saith the LORD that hath mercy on thee.   

{54:11} O thou afflicted, tossed with tempest, [and] not comforted,behold, I will lay thy stones with fair colors, and lay thy foundationswith sapphires. 

{54:12} And I will make thy windows of agates, and thygates of carbuncles, and all thy borders of pleasant stones. 

{54:13}And all thy children [shall be] taught of the LORD; and great [shallbe] the peace of thy children. 

{54:14} In righteousness shalt thou beestablished: thou shalt be far from oppression; for thou shalt notfear: and from terror; for it shall not come near thee. 

{54:15} Behold,they shall surely gather together, [but] not by me: whosoever shallgather together against thee shall fall for thy sake. 

{54:16} Behold, Ihave created the smith that bloweth the coals in the fire, and thatbringeth forth an instrument for his work; and I have created thewaster to destroy.   

{54:17} No weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper; andevery tongue [that] shall rise against thee in judgment thou shaltcondemn. This [is] the heritage of the servants of the LORD, and theirrighteousness [is] of me, saith the LORD.   

{55:1} Ho, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters, and hethat hath no money; come ye, buy, and eat; yea, come, buy wine and milkwithout money and without price. 

{55:2} Wherefore do ye spend money for[that which is] not bread? and your labour for [that which] satisfiethnot? hearken diligently unto me, and eat ye [that which is] good, andlet your soul delight itself in fatness. 

{55:3} Incline your ear, andcome unto me: hear, and your soul shall live; and I will make aneverlasting covenant with you, [even] the sure mercies of David. 

{55:4}Behold, I have given him [for] a witness to the people, a leader andcommander to the people. 

{55:5} Behold, thou shalt call a nation [that]thou knowest not, and nations [that] knew not thee shall run unto theebecause of the LORD thy God, and for the Holy One of Israel; for hehath glorified thee.   

{55:6} Seek ye the LORD while he may be found, call ye upon himwhile he is near: 

{55:7} Let the wicked forsake his way, and theunrighteous man his thoughts: and let him return unto the LORD, and hewill have mercy upon him; and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.   

{55:8} For my thoughts [are] not your thoughts, neither [are] yourways my ways, saith the LORD. 

{55:9} For [as] the heavens are higherthan the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughtsthan your thoughts. 

{55:10} For as the rain cometh down, and the snowfrom heaven, and returneth not thither, but watereth the earth, andmaketh it bring forth and bud, that it may give seed to the sower, andbread to the eater: 

{55:11} So shall my word be that goeth forth out ofmy mouth: it shall not return unto me void, but it shall accomplishthat which I please, and it shall prosper [in the thing] whereto I sentit. 

{55:12} For ye shall go out with joy, and be led forth with peace:the mountains and the hills shall break forth before you into singing,and all the trees of the field shall clap [their] hands. 

{55:13}Instead of the thorn shall come up the fir tree, and instead of thebrier shall come up the myrtle tree: and it shall be to the LORD for aname, for an everlasting sign [that] shall not be cut off.   

{56:1} Thus saith the LORD, Keep ye judgment, and do justice: for mysalvation [is] near to come, and my righteousness to be revealed.

{56:2} Blessed [is] the man [that] doeth this, and the son of man[that] layeth hold on it; that keepeth the sabbath from polluting it,and keepeth his hand from doing any evil.   

{56:3} Neither let the son of the stranger, that hath joined himselfto the LORD, speak, saying, The LORD hath utterly separated me from hispeople: neither let the eunuch say, Behold, I [am] a dry tree. 

{56:4}For thus saith the LORD unto the eunuchs that keep my sabbaths, andchoose [the things] that please me, and take hold of my covenant;

{56:5} Even unto them will I give in mine house and within my walls aplace and a name better than of sons and of daughters: I will give theman everlasting name, that shall not be cut off. 

{56:6} Also the sons ofthe stranger, that join themselves to the LORD, to serve him, and tolove the name of the LORD, to be his servants, every one that keepeththe sabbath from polluting it, and taketh hold of my covenant; 

{56:7}Even them will I bring to my holy mountain, and make them joyful in myhouse of prayer: their burnt offerings and their sacrifices [shall be]accepted upon mine altar; for mine house shall be called an house ofprayer for all people. 

{56:8} The Lord GOD which gathereth the outcastsof Israel saith, Yet will I gather [others] to him, beside those thatare gathered unto him.   

{56:9} All ye beasts of the field, come to devour, [yea,] all yebeasts in the forest. 

{56:10} His watchmen [are] blind: they are allignorant, they [are] all dumb dogs, they cannot bark; sleeping, lyingdown, loving to slumber. 

{56:11} Yea, [they are] greedy dogs [which]can never have enough, and they [are] shepherds [that] cannotunderstand: they all look to their own way, every one for his gain,from his quarter. 

{56:12} Come ye, [say they,] I will fetch wine, andwe will fill ourselves with strong drink; and to morrow shall be asthis day, [and] much more abundant.   

{57:1} The righteous perisheth, and no man layeth [it] to heart: andmerciful men [are] taken away, none considering that the righteous istaken away from the evil [to come. ]

{57:2} He shall enter into peace:they shall rest in their beds, [each one] walking [in] his uprightness.   

{57:3} But draw near hither, ye sons of the sorceress, the seed ofthe adulterer and the whore. 

{57:4} Against whom do ye sportyourselves? against whom make ye a wide mouth, [and] draw out thetongue? [are] ye not children of transgression, a seed of falsehood,

{57:5} Enflaming yourselves with idols under every green tree, slayingthe children in the valleys under the clifts of the rocks? 

{57:6} Amongthe smooth [stones] of the stream [is] thy portion; they, they [are]thy lot: even to them hast thou poured a drink offering, thou hastoffered a meat offering. Should I receive comfort in these? 

{57:7} Upona lofty and high mountain hast thou set thy bed: even thither wentestthou up to offer sacrifice. 

{57:8} Behind the doors also and the postshast thou set up thy remembrance: for thou hast discovered [thyself toanother] than me, and art gone up; thou hast enlarged thy bed, and madethee [a covenant] with them; thou lovedst their bed where thou sawest[it. ]

{57:9} And thou wentest to the king with ointment, and didstincrease thy perfumes, and didst send thy messengers far off, and didstdebase [thyself even] unto hell. 

{57:10} Thou art wearied in thegreatness of thy way; [yet] saidst thou not, There is no hope: thouhast found the life of thine hand; therefore thou wast not grieved.

{57:11} And of whom hast thou been afraid or feared, that thou hastlied, and hast not remembered me, nor laid [it] to thy heart? have notI held my peace even of old, and thou fearest me not? 

{57:12} I willdeclare thy righteousness, and thy works; for they shall not profitthee.   

{57:13} When thou criest, let thy companies deliver thee; but thewind shall carry them all away; vanity shall take [them:] but he thatputteth his trust in me shall possess the land, and shall inherit myholy mountain; 

{57:14} And shall say, Cast ye up, cast ye up, preparethe way, take up the stumblingblock out of the way of my people.

{57:15} For thus saith the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity,whose name [is] Holy; I dwell in the high and holy [place,] with himalso [that is] of a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit ofthe humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones. 

{57:16} For Iwill not contend for ever, neither will I be always wroth: for thespirit should fail before me, and the souls [which] I have made.

{57:17} For the iniquity of his covetousness was I wroth, and smotehim: I hid me, and was wroth, and he went on frowardly in the way ofhis heart. 

{57:18} I have seen his ways, and will heal him: I will leadhim also, and restore comforts unto him and to his mourners. 

{57:19} Icreate the fruit of the lips; Peace, peace to [him that is] far off,and to [him that is] near, saith the LORD; and I will heal him. 

{57:20}But the wicked [are] like the troubled sea, when it cannot rest, whosewaters cast up mire and dirt. 

{57:21} [There is] no peace, saith myGod, to the wicked.   

{58:1} Cry aloud, spare not, lift up thy voice like a trumpet, andshew my people their transgression, and the house of Jacob their sins.

{58:2} Yet they seek me daily, and delight to know my ways, as a nationthat did righteousness, and forsook not the ordinance of their God:they ask of me the ordinances of justice; they take delight inapproaching to God.   

{58:3} Wherefore have we fasted, [say they,] and thou seest not?[wherefore] have we afflicted our soul, and thou takest no knowledge?Behold, in the day of your fast ye find pleasure, and exact all yourlabours. 

{58:4} Behold, ye fast for strife and debate, and to smitewith the fist of wickedness: ye shall not fast as [ye do this] day, tomake your voice to be heard on high. 

{58:5} Is it such a fast that Ihave chosen? a day for a man to afflict his soul? [is it] to bow downhis head as a bulrush, and to spread sackcloth and ashes [under him?]wilt thou call this a fast, and an acceptable day to the LORD? 

{58:6}[Is] not this the fast that I have chosen? to loose the bands ofwickedness, to undo the heavy burdens, and to let the oppressed gofree, and that ye break every yoke? 

{58:7} [Is it] not to deal thybread to the hungry, and that thou bring the poor that are cast out tothy house? when thou seest the naked, that thou cover him; and thatthou hide not thyself from thine own flesh?   

{58:8} Then shall thy light break forth as the morning, and thinehealth shall spring forth speedily: and thy righteousness shall gobefore thee; the glory of the LORD shall be thy rereward. 

{58:9} Thenshalt thou call, and the LORD shall answer; thou shalt cry, and heshall say, Here I [am.] If thou take away from the midst of thee theyoke, the putting forth of the finger, and speaking vanity; 

{58:10} And[if] thou draw out thy soul to the hungry, and satisfy the afflictedsoul; then shall thy light rise in obscurity, and thy darkness [be] asthe noonday: 

{58:11} And the LORD shall guide thee continually, andsatisfy thy soul in drought, and make fat thy bones: and thou shalt belike a watered garden, and like a spring of water, whose waters failnot. 

{58:12} And [they that shall be] of thee shall build the old wasteplaces: thou shalt raise up the foundations of many generations; andthou shalt be called, The repairer of the breach, The restorer of pathsto dwell in.   

{58:13} If thou turn away thy foot from the sabbath, [from] doingthy pleasure on my holy day; and call the sabbath a delight, the holyof the LORD, honourable; and shalt honour him, not doing thine ownways, nor finding thine own pleasure, nor speaking [thine own] words:

{58:14} Then shalt thou delight thyself in the LORD; and I will causethee to ride upon the high places of the earth, and feed thee with theheritage of Jacob thy father: for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken[it.]   

{59:1} Behold, the LORD'S hand is not shortened, that it cannotsave; neither his ear heavy, that it cannot hear: 

{59:2} But youriniquities have separated between you and your God, and your sins havehid [his] face from you, that he will not hear. 

{59:3} For your handsare defiled with blood, and your fingers with iniquity; your lips havespoken lies, your tongue hath muttered perverseness. 

{59:4} Nonecalleth for justice, nor [any] pleadeth for truth: they trust invanity, and speak lies; they conceive mischief, and bring forthiniquity. 

{59:5} They hatch cockatrice' eggs, and weave the spider'sweb: he that eateth of their eggs dieth, and that which is crushedbreaketh out into a viper. 

{59:6} Their webs shall not become garments,neither shall they cover themselves with their works: their works [are]works of iniquity, and the act of violence [is] in their hands. 

{59:7}Their feet run to evil, and they make haste to shed innocent blood:their thoughts [are] thoughts of iniquity; wasting and destruction[are] in their paths. 

{59:8} The way of peace they know not; and [thereis] no judgment in their goings: they have made them crooked paths:whosoever goeth therein shall not know peace.   

{59:9} Therefore is judgment far from us, neither doth justiceovertake us: we wait for light, but behold obscurity; for brightness,[but] we walk in darkness. 

{59:10} We grope for the wall like theblind, and we grope as if [we had] no eyes: we stumble at noonday as inthe night; [we are] in desolate places as dead [men. ]

{59:11} We roarall like bears, and mourn sore like doves: we look for judgment, but[there is] none; for salvation, [but] it is far off from us. 

{59:12}For our transgressions are multiplied before thee, and our sins testifyagainst us: for our transgressions [are] with us; and [as for] ouriniquities, we know them; 

{59:13} In transgressing and lying againstthe LORD, and departing away from our God, speaking oppression andrevolt, conceiving and uttering from the heart words of falsehood.

{59:14} And judgment is turned away backward, and justice standeth afaroff: for truth is fallen in the street, and equity cannot enter.

{59:15} Yea, truth faileth; and he [that] departeth from evil makethhimself a prey: and the LORD saw [it,] and it displeased him that[there was] no judgment.   

{59:16} And he saw that [there was] no man, and wondered that [therewas] no intercessor: therefore his arm brought salvation unto him; andhis righteousness, it sustained him. 

{59:17} For he put onrighteousness as a breastplate, and an helmet of salvation upon hishead; and he put on the garments of vengeance [for] clothing, and wasclad with zeal as a cloke. 

{59:18} According to [their] deeds,accordingly he will repay, fury to his adversaries, recompence to hisenemies; to the islands he will repay recompence. 

{59:19} So shall theyfear the name of the LORD from the west, and his glory from the risingof the sun. When the enemy shall come in like a flood, the Spirit ofthe LORD shall lift up a standard against him.   

{59:20} And the Redeemer shall come to Zion, and unto them that turnfrom transgression in Jacob, saith the LORD. 

{59:21} As for me, this[is] my covenant with them, saith the LORD; My spirit that [is] uponthee, and my words which I have put in thy mouth, shall not depart outof thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy seed, nor out of the mouth ofthy seed's seed, saith the LORD, from henceforth and for ever.   

{60:1} Arise, shine; for thy light is come, and the glory of theLORD is risen upon thee. 

{60:2} For, behold, the darkness shall coverthe earth, and gross darkness the people: but the LORD shall arise uponthee, and his glory shall be seen upon thee. 

{60:3} And the Gentilesshall come to thy light, and kings to the brightness of thy rising.

{60:4} Lift up thine eyes round about, and see: all they gatherthemselves together, they come to thee: thy sons shall come from far,and thy daughters shall be nursed at [thy] side. 

{60:5} Then thou shaltsee, and flow together, and thine heart shall fear, and be enlarged;because the abundance of the sea shall be converted unto thee, theforces of the Gentiles shall come unto thee. 

{60:6} The multitude ofcamels shall cover thee, the dromedaries of Midian and Ephah; all theyfrom Sheba shall come: they shall bring gold and incense; and theyshall shew forth the praises of the LORD. 

{60:7} All the flocks ofKedar shall be gathered together unto thee, the rams of Nebaioth shallminister unto thee: they shall come up with acceptance on mine altar,and I will glorify the house of my glory. 

{60:8} Who [are] these [that]fly as a cloud, and as the doves to their windows? 

{60:9} Surely theisles shall wait for me, and the ships of Tarshish first, to bring thysons from far, their silver and their gold with them, unto the name ofthe LORD thy God, and to the Holy One of Israel, because he hathglorified thee. 

{60:10} And the sons of strangers shall build up thywalls, and their kings shall minister unto thee: for in my wrath Ismote thee, but in my favour have I had mercy on thee. 

{60:11}Therefore thy gates shall be open continually; they shall not be shutday nor night; that [men] may bring unto thee the forces of theGentiles, and [that] their kings [may be] brought. 

{60:12} For thenation and kingdom that will not serve thee shall perish; yea, [those]nations shall be utterly wasted. 

{60:13} The glory of Lebanon shallcome unto thee, the fir tree, the pine tree, and the box together, tobeautify the place of my sanctuary; and I will make the place of myfeet glorious. 

{60:14} The sons also of them that afflicted thee shallcome bending unto thee; and all they that despised thee shall bowthemselves down at the soles of thy feet; and they shall call thee, Thecity of the LORD, The Zion of the Holy One of Israel. 

{60:15} Whereasthou hast been forsaken and hated, so that no man went through [thee,]I will make thee an eternal excellency, a joy of many generations.

{60:16} Thou shalt also suck the milk of the Gentiles, and shalt suckthe breast of kings: and thou shalt know that I the LORD [am] thySaviour and thy Redeemer, the mighty One of Jacob. 

{60:17} For brass Iwill bring gold, and for iron I will bring silver, and for wood brass,and for stones iron: I will also make thy officers peace, and thineexactors righteousness. 

{60:18} Violence shall no more be heard in thyland, wasting nor destruction within thy borders; but thou shalt callthy walls Salvation, and thy gates Praise. 

{60:19} The sun shall be nomore thy light by day; neither for brightness shall the moon give lightunto thee: but the LORD shall be unto thee an everlasting light, andthy God thy glory. 

{60:20} Thy sun shall no more go down; neither shallthy moon withdraw itself: for the LORD shall be thine everlastinglight, and the days of thy mourning shall be ended. 

{60:21} Thy peoplealso [shall be] all righteous: they shall inherit the land for ever,the branch of my planting, the work of my hands, that I may beglorified. 

{60:22} A little one shall become a thousand, and a smallone a strong nation: I the LORD will hasten it in his time.   

{61:1} The Spirit of the Lord GOD [is] upon me; because the LORDhath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek; he hath sent meto bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, andthe opening of the prison to [them that are] bound; 

{61:2} To proclaimthe acceptable year of the LORD, and the day of vengeance of our God;to comfort all that mourn; 

{61:3} To appoint unto them that mourn inZion, to give unto them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning,the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness; that they might becalled trees of righteousness, the planting of the LORD, that he mightbe glorified.   

{61:4} And they shall build the old wastes, they shall raise up theformer desolations, and they shall repair the waste cities, thedesolations of many generations. 

{61:5} And strangers shall stand andfeed your flocks, and the sons of the alien [shall be] your plowmen andyour vinedressers. 

{61:6} But ye shall be named the Priests of theLORD: [men] shall call you the Ministers of our God: ye shall eat theriches of the Gentiles, and in their glory shall ye boast yourselves.   

{61:7} For your shame [ye shall have] double; and [for] confusionthey shall rejoice in their portion: therefore in their land they shallpossess the double: everlasting joy shall be unto them. 

{61:8} For Ithe LORD love judgment, I hate robbery for burnt offering; and I willdirect their work in truth, and I will make an everlasting covenantwith them. 

{61:9} And their seed shall be known among the Gentiles, andtheir offspring among the people: all that see them shall acknowledgethem, that they [are] the seed [which] the LORD hath blessed. 

{61:10} Iwill greatly rejoice in the LORD, my soul shall be joyful in my God;for he hath clothed me with the garments of salvation, he hath coveredme with the robe of righteousness, as a bridegroom decketh [himself]with ornaments, and as a bride adorneth [herself] with her jewels.

{61:11} For as the earth bringeth forth her bud, and as the gardencauseth the things that are sown in it to spring forth; so the Lord GODwill cause righteousness and praise to spring forth before all thenations.   

{62:1} For Zion's sake will I not hold my peace, and for Jerusalem'ssake I will not rest, until the righteousness thereof go forth asbrightness, and the salvation thereof as a lamp [that] burneth. 

{62:2}And the Gentiles shall see thy righteousness, and all kings thy glory:and thou shalt be called by a new name, which the mouth of the LORDshall name. 

{62:3} Thou shalt also be a crown of glory in the hand ofthe LORD, and a royal diadem in the hand of thy God. 

{62:4} Thou shaltno more be termed Forsaken; neither shall thy land any more be termedDesolate: but thou shalt be called Hephzi-bah, and thy land Beulah: forthe LORD delighteth in thee, and thy land shall be married.   

{62:5} For [as] a young man marrieth a virgin, [so] shall thy sonsmarry thee: and [as] the bridegroom rejoiceth over the bride, [so]shall thy God rejoice over thee. 

{62:6} I have set watchmen upon thywalls, O Jerusalem, [which] shall never hold their peace day nor night:ye that make mention of the LORD, keep not silence, 

{62:7} And give himno rest, till he establish, and till he make Jerusalem a praise in theearth. 

{62:8} The LORD hath sworn by his right hand, and by the arm ofhis strength, Surely I will no more give thy corn [to be] meat forthine enemies; and the sons of the stranger shall not drink thy wine,for the which thou hast laboured: 

{62:9} But they that have gathered itshall eat it, and praise the LORD; and they that have brought ittogether shall drink it in the courts of my holiness.   

{62:10} Go through, go through the gates; prepare ye the way of thepeople; cast up, cast up the highways; gather out the stones; lift up astandard for the people. 

{62:11} Behold, the LORD hath proclaimed untothe end of the world, Say ye to the daughter of Zion, Behold, thysalvation cometh; behold, his reward [is] with him, and his work beforehim. 

{62:12} And they shall call them, The holy people, The redeemed ofthe LORD: and thou shalt be called, Sought out, A city not forsaken.   

{63:1} Who [is] this that cometh from Edom, with dyed garments fromBozrah? this [that is] glorious in his apparel, travelling in thegreatness of his strength? I that speak in righteousness, mighty tosave. 

{63:2} Wherefore [art thou] red in thine apparel, and thygarments like him that treadeth in the winefat? 

{63:3} I have troddenthe winepress alone; and of the people [there was] none with me: for Iwill tread them in mine anger, and trample them in my fury; and theirblood shall be sprinkled upon my garments, and I will stain all myraiment. 

{63:4} For the day of vengeance [is] in mine heart, and theyear of my redeemed is come. 

{63:5} And I looked, and [there was] noneto help; and I wondered that [there was] none to uphold: therefore mineown arm brought salvation unto me; and my fury, it upheld me. 

{63:6}And I will tread down the people in mine anger, and make them drunk inmy fury, and I will bring down their strength to the earth.   

{63:7} I will mention the lovingkindnesses of the LORD, [and] thepraises of the LORD, according to all that the LORD hath bestowed onus, and the great goodness toward the house of Israel, which he hathbestowed on them according to his mercies, and according to themultitude of his lovingkindnesses. 

{63:8} For he said, Surely they[are] my people, children [that] will not lie: so he was their Saviour.

{63:9} In all their affliction he was afflicted, and the angel of hispresence saved them: in his love and in his pity he redeemed them; andhe bare them, and carried them all the days of old.   

{63:10} But they rebelled, and vexed his holy Spirit: therefore hewas turned to be their enemy, [and] he fought against them. 

{63:11}Then he remembered the days of old, Moses, [and] his people, [saying,]Where [is] he that brought them up out of the sea with the shepherd ofhis flock? where [is] he that put his holy Spirit within him? 

{63:12}That led [them] by the right hand of Moses with his glorious arm,dividing the water before them, to make himself an everlasting name?

{63:13} That led them through the deep, as an horse in the wilderness,[that] they should not stumble? 

{63:14} As a beast goeth down into thevalley, the Spirit of the LORD caused him to rest: so didst thou leadthy people, to make thyself a glorious name.   

{63:15} Look down from heaven, and behold from the habitation of thyholiness and of thy glory: where [is] thy zeal and thy strength, thesounding of thy bowels and of thy mercies toward me? are theyrestrained? 

{63:16} Doubtless thou [art] our father, though Abraham beignorant of us, and Israel acknowledge us not: thou, O LORD, [art] ourfather, our redeemer; thy name [is] from everlasting.   

{63:17} O LORD, why hast thou made us to err from thy ways, [and]hardened our heart from thy fear? Return for thy servants' sake, thetribes of thine inheritance. 

{63:18} The people of thy holiness havepossessed [it] but a little while: our adversaries have trodden downthy sanctuary. 

{63:19} We are [thine:] thou never barest rule overthem; they were not called by thy name.   

{64:1} Oh that thou wouldest rend the heavens, that thou wouldestcome down, that the mountains might flow down at thy presence, 

{64:2}As [when] the melting fire burneth, the fire causeth the waters toboil, to make thy name known to thine adversaries, [that] the nationsmay tremble at thy presence! 

{64:3} When thou didst terrible things[which] we looked not for, thou camest down, the mountains flowed downat thy presence. 

{64:4} For since the beginning of the world [men] havenot heard, nor perceived by the ear, neither hath the eye seen, O God,beside thee, [what] he hath prepared for him that waiteth for him.

{64:5} Thou meetest him that rejoiceth and worketh righteousness,[those that] remember thee in thy ways: behold, thou art wroth; for wehave sinned: in those is continuance, and we shall be saved. 

{64:6} Butwe are all as an unclean [thing,] and all our righteousnesses [are] asfilthy rags; and we all do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like thewind, have taken us away. 

{64:7} And [there is] none that calleth uponthy name, that stirreth up himself to take hold of thee: for thou hasthid thy face from us, and hast consumed us, because of our iniquities.

{64:8} But now, O LORD, thou [art] our father; we [are] the clay, andthou our potter; and we all [are] the work of thy hand.   

{64:9} Be not wroth very sore, O LORD, neither remember iniquity forever: behold, see, we beseech thee, we [are] all thy people. 

{64:10}Thy holy cities are a wilderness, Zion is a wilderness, Jerusalem adesolation. 

{64:11} Our holy and our beautiful house, where our fatherspraised thee, is burned up with fire: and all our pleasant things arelaid waste. 

{64:12} Wilt thou refrain thyself for these [things,] OLORD? wilt thou hold thy peace, and afflict us very sore?   

{65:1} I am sought of [them that] asked not [for me;] I am found of[them that] sought me not: I said, Behold me, behold me, unto a nation[that] was not called by my name. 

{65:2} I have spread out my hands allthe day unto a rebellious people, which walketh in a way [that was] notgood, after their own thoughts; 

{65:3} A people that provoketh me toanger continually to my face; that sacrificeth in gardens, and burnethincense upon altars of brick; 

{65:4} Which remain among the graves, andlodge in the monuments, which eat swine's flesh, and broth ofabominable [things is in] their vessels; 

{65:5} Which say, Stand bythyself, come not near to me; for I am holier than thou. [These] are asmoke in my nose, a fire that burneth all the day. 

{65:6} Behold, [itis] written before me: I will not keep silence, but will recompense,even recompense into their bosom, 

{65:7} Your iniquities, and theiniquities of your fathers together, saith the LORD, which have burnedincense upon the mountains, and blasphemed me upon the hills: thereforewill I measure their former work into their bosom.   

{65:8} Thus saith the LORD, As the new wine is found in the cluster,and [one] saith, Destroy it not; for a blessing [is] in it: so will Ido for my servants' sakes, that I may not destroy them all. 

{65:9} AndI will bring forth a seed out of Jacob, and out of Judah an inheritorof my mountains: and mine elect shall inherit it, and my servants shalldwell there. 

{65:10} And Sharon shall be a fold of flocks, and thevalley of Achor a place for the herds to lie down in, for my peoplethat have sought me.   

{65:11} But ye [are] they that forsake the LORD, that forget my holymountain, that prepare a table for that troop, and that furnish thedrink offering unto that number. 

{65:12} Therefore will I number you tothe sword, and ye shall all bow down to the slaughter: because when Icalled, ye did not answer; when I spake, ye did not hear; but did evilbefore mine eyes, and did choose [that] wherein I delighted not.

{65:13} Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD, Behold, my servants shalleat, but ye shall be hungry: behold, my servants shall drink, but yeshall be thirsty: behold, my servants shall rejoice, but ye shall beashamed: 

{65:14} Behold, my servants shall sing for joy of heart, butye shall cry for sorrow of heart, and shall howl for vexation ofspirit. 

{65:15} And ye shall leave your name for a curse unto mychosen: for the Lord GOD shall slay thee, and call his servants byanother name: 

{65:16} That he who blesseth himself in the earth shallbless himself in the God of truth; and he that sweareth in the earthshall swear by the God of truth; because the former troubles areforgotten, and because they are hid from mine eyes.   

{65:17} For, behold, I create new heavens and a new earth: and theformer shall not be remembered, nor come into mind. 

{65:18} But be yeglad and rejoice for ever [in that] which I create: for, behold, Icreate Jerusalem a rejoicing, and her people a joy. 

{65:19} And I willrejoice in Jerusalem, and joy in my people: and the voice of weepingshall be no more heard in her, nor the voice of crying. 

{65:20} Thereshall be no more thence an infant of days, nor an old man that hath notfilled his days: for the child shall die an hundred years old; but thesinner [being] an hundred years old shall be accursed. 

{65:21} And theyshall build houses, and inhabit [them;] and they shall plant vineyards,and eat the fruit of them. 

{65:22} They shall not build, and anotherinhabit; they shall not plant, and another eat: for as the days of atree [are] the days of my people, and mine elect shall long enjoy thework of their hands. 

{65:23} They shall not labour in vain, nor bringforth for trouble; for they [are] the seed of the blessed of the LORD,and their offspring with them. 

{65:24} And it shall come to pass, thatbefore they call, I will answer; and while they are yet speaking, Iwill hear. 

{65:25} The wolf and the lamb shall feed together, and thelion shall eat straw like the bullock: and dust [shall be] theserpent's meat. They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holymountain, saith the LORD.   

{66:1} Thus saith the LORD, The heaven [is] my throne, and the earth[is] my footstool: where [is] the house that ye build unto me? andwhere [is] the place of my rest? 

{66:2} For all those [things] hathmine hand made, and all those [things] have been, saith the LORD: butto this [man] will I look, [even] to [him that is] poor and of acontrite spirit, and trembleth at my word. 

{66:3} He that killeth an ox[is as if] he slew a man; he that sacrificeth a lamb, [as if] he cutoff a dog's neck; he that offereth an oblation, [as if he offered]swine's blood; he that burneth incense, [as if] he blessed an idol.Yea, they have chosen their own ways, and their soul delighteth intheir abominations. 

{66:4} I also will choose their delusions, and willbring their fears upon them; because when I called, none did answer;when I spake, they did not hear: but they did evil before mine eyes,and chose [that] in which I delighted not.   

{66:5} Hear the word of the LORD, ye that tremble at his word; yourbrethren that hated you, that cast you out for my name's sake, said,Let the LORD be glorified: but he shall appear to your joy, and theyshall be ashamed. 

{66:6} A voice of noise from the city, a voice fromthe temple, a voice of the LORD that rendereth recompence to hisenemies. 

{66:7} Before she travailed, she brought forth; before herpain came, she was delivered of a man child. 

{66:8} Who hath heard sucha thing? who hath seen such things? Shall the earth be made to bringforth in one day? [or] shall a nation be born at once? for as soon asZion travailed, she brought forth her children. 

{66:9} Shall I bring tothe birth, and not cause to bring forth? saith the LORD: shall I causeto bring forth, and shut [the womb?] saith thy God. 

{66:10} Rejoice yewith Jerusalem, and be glad with her, all ye that love her: rejoice forjoy with her, all ye that mourn for her: 

{66:11} That ye may suck, andbe satisfied with the breasts of her consolations; that ye may milkout, and be delighted with the abundance of her glory. 

{66:12} For thussaith the LORD, Behold, I will extend peace to her like a river, andthe glory of the Gentiles like a flowing stream: then shall ye suck, yeshall be borne upon [her] sides, and be dandled upon [her] knees.

{66:13} As one whom his mother comforteth, so will I comfort you; andye shall be comforted in Jerusalem. 

{66:14} And when ye see [this,]your heart shall rejoice, and your bones shall flourish like an herb:and the hand of the LORD shall be known toward his servants, and [his]indignation toward his enemies. 

{66:15} For, behold, the LORD will comewith fire, and with his chariots like a whirlwind, to render his angerwith fury, and his rebuke with flames of fire. 

{66:16} For by fire andby his sword will the LORD plead with all flesh: and the slain of theLORD shall be many. 

{66:17} They that sanctify themselves, and purifythemselves in the gardens behind one [tree] in the midst, eatingswine's flesh, and the abomination, and the mouse, shall be consumedtogether, saith the LORD. 

{66:18} For I [know] their works and theirthoughts: it shall come, that I will gather all nations and tongues;and they shall come, and see my glory. 

{66:19} And I will set a signamong them, and I will send those that escape of them unto the nations,[to] Tarshish, Pul, and Lud, that draw the bow, [to] Tubal, and Javan,[to] the isles afar off, that have not heard my fame, neither have seenmy glory; and they shall declare my glory among the Gentiles. 

{66:20}And they shall bring all your brethren [for] an offering unto the LORDout of all nations upon horses, and in chariots, and in litters, andupon mules, and upon swift beasts, to my holy mountain Jerusalem, saiththe LORD, as the children of Israel bring an offering in a clean vesselinto the house of the LORD. 

{66:21} And I will also take of them forpriests [and] for Levites, saith the LORD. 

{66:22} For as the newheavens and the new earth, which I will make, shall remain before me,saith the LORD, so shall your seed and your name remain. 

{66:23} And itshall come to pass, [that] from one new moon to another, and from onesabbath to another, shall all flesh come to worship before me, saiththe LORD. 

{66:24} And they shall go forth, and look upon the carcasesof the men that have transgressed against me: for their worm shall notdie, neither shall their fire be quenched; and they shall be anabhorring unto all flesh.
