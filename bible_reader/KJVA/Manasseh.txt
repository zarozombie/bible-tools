{The Prayer of Manasseh, or, The Prayer of Manasses King of Judah   

{1:1} O Lord, Almighty God of our fathers, Abraham, Isaac, andJacob, and of their righteous seed; 

{1:2} who hast made heaven andearth, with all the ornament thereof; 

{1:3} who hast bound the sea bythe word of thy commandment; who hast shut up the deep, and sealed itby thy terrible and glorious name; 

{1:4} whom all men fear, and tremblebefore thy power; for the majesty of thy glory cannot be borne, andthine angry threatening toward sinners is importable: 

{1:5} but thymerciful promise is unmeasurable and unsearchable; 

{1:6} for thou artthe most high Lord, of great compassion, longsuffering, very merciful,and repentest of the evils of men. Thou, O Lord, according to thy greatgoodness hast promised repentance and forgiveness to them that havesinned against thee: and of thine infinite mercies hast appointedrepentance unto sinners, that they may be saved. 

{1:7} Thou therefore,O Lord, that art the God of the just, hast not appointed repentance tothe just, as to Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, which have not sinnedagainst thee; but thou hast appointed repentance unto me that am asinner: 

{1:8} for I have sinned above the number of the sands of thesea. My transgressions, O Lord, are multiplied: my transgressions aremultiplied, and I am not worthy to behold and see the height of heavenfor the multitude of mine iniquities. 

{1:9} I am bowed down with manyiron bands, that I cannot lift up mine head, neither have any release:for I have provoked thy wrath, and done evil before thee: I did not thywill, neither kept I thy commandments: I have set up abominations, andhave multiplied offences. 

{1:10} Now therefore I bow the knee of mineheart, beseeching thee of grace. 

{1:11} I have sinned, O Lord, I havesinned, and I acknowledge mine iniquities: 

{1:12} wherefore, I humblybeseech thee, forgive me, O Lord, forgive me, and destroy me not withmine iniquites. Be not angry with me for ever, by reserving evil forme; neither condemn me to the lower parts of the earth. For thou artthe God, even the God of them that repent; 

{1:13} and in me thou wiltshew all thy goodness: for thou wilt save me, that am unworthy,according to thy great mercy. 

{1:14} Therefore I will praise thee forever all the days of my life: for all the powers of the heavens dopraise thee, and thine is the glory for ever and ever. Amen.
