{The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians   

{1:1} Paul, an apostle, (not of men, neither by man, but by JesusChrist, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead;) 

{1:2} Andall the brethren which are with me, unto the churches of Galatia: 

{1:3}Grace [be] to you and peace from God the Father, and [from] our LordJesus Christ, 

{1:4} Who gave himself for our sins, that he mightdeliver us from this present evil world, according to the will of Godand our Father: 

{1:5} To whom [be] glory for ever and ever. Amen.   

{1:6} I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called youinto the grace of Christ unto another gospel: 

{1:7} Which is notanother; but there be some that trouble you, and would pervert thegospel of Christ. 

{1:8} But though we, or an angel from heaven, preachany other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you,let him be accursed. 

{1:9} As we said before, so say I now again, Ifany [man] preach any other gospel unto you than that ye have received,let him be accursed.   

{1:10} For do I now persuade men, or God? or do I seek to pleasemen? for if I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ.

{1:11} But I certify you, brethren, that the gospel which was preachedof me is not after man. 

{1:12} For I neither received it of man,neither was I taught [it,] but by the revelation of Jesus Christ.

{1:13} For ye have heard of my conversation in time past in the Jews'religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God, andwasted it: 

{1:14} And profited in the Jews' religion above many myequals in mine own nation, being more exceedingly zealous of thetraditions of my fathers. 

{1:15} But when it pleased God, who separatedme from my mother's womb, and called [me] by his grace, 

{1:16} Toreveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the heathen;immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood: 

{1:17} Neither went Iup to Jerusalem to them which were apostles before me; but I went intoArabia, and returned again unto Damascus. 

{1:18} Then after three yearsI went up to Jerusalem to see Peter, and abode with him fifteen days.

{1:19} But other of the apostles saw I none, save James the Lord'sbrother. 

{1:20} Now the things which I write unto you, behold, beforeGod, I lie not. 

{1:21} Afterwards I came into the regions of Syria andCilicia; 

{1:22} And was unknown by face unto the churches of Judaeawhich were in Christ: 

{1:23} But they had heard only, That he whichpersecuted us in times past now preacheth the faith which once hedestroyed. 

{1:24} And they glorified God in me.   

{2:1} Then fourteen years after I went up again to Jerusalem withBarnabas, and took Titus with [me] also. 

{2:2} And I went up byrevelation, and communicated unto them that gospel which I preach amongthe Gentiles, but privately to them which were of reputation, lest byany means I should run, or had run, in vain. 

{2:3} But neither Titus,who was with me, being a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised: 

{2:4}And that because of false brethren unawares brought in, who came inprivily to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, that theymight bring us into bondage: 

{2:5} To whom we gave place by subjection,no, not for an hour; that the truth of the gospel might continue withyou. 

{2:6} But of these who seemed to be somewhat, (whatsoever theywere, it maketh no matter to me: God accepteth no man's person:) forthey who seemed [to be somewhat] in conference added nothing to me:

{2:7} But contrariwise, when they saw that the gospel of theuncircumcision was committed unto me, as [the gospel] of thecircumcision [was] unto Peter; 

{2:8} (For he that wrought effectuallyin Peter to the apostleship of the circumcision, the same was mighty inme toward the Gentiles:) 

{2:9} And when James, Cephas, and John, whoseemed to be pillars, perceived the grace that was given unto me, theygave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship; that we [shouldgo] unto the heathen, and they unto the circumcision. 

{2:10} Only [theywould] that we should remember the poor; the same which I also wasforward to do. 

{2:11} But when Peter was come to Antioch, I withstoodhim to the face, because he was to be blamed. 

{2:12} For before thatcertain came from James, he did eat with the Gentiles: but when theywere come, he withdrew and separated himself, fearing them which wereof the circumcision. 

{2:13} And the other Jews dissembled likewise withhim; insomuch that Barnabas also was carried away with theirdissimulation. 

{2:14} But when I saw that they walked not uprightlyaccording to the truth of the gospel, I said unto Peter before [them]all, If thou, being a Jew, livest after the manner of Gentiles, and notas do the Jews, why compellest thou the Gentiles to live as do theJews? 

{2:15} We [who are] Jews by nature, and not sinners of theGentiles, 

{2:16} Knowing that a man is not justified by the works ofthe law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed inJesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of Christ, andnot by the works of the law: for by the works of the law shall no fleshbe justified. 

{2:17} But if, while we seek to be justified by Christ,we ourselves also are found sinners, [is] therefore Christ the ministerof sin? God forbid. 

{2:18} For if I build again the things which Idestroyed, I make myself a transgressor. 

{2:19} For I through the lawam dead to the law, that I might live unto God. 

{2:20} I am crucifiedwith Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me:and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of theSon of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me. 

{2:21} I do notfrustrate the grace of God: for if righteousness [come] by the law,then Christ is dead in vain.   

{3:1} O foolish Galatians, who hath bewitched you, that ye shouldnot obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been evidentlyset forth, crucified among you? 

{3:2} This only would I learn of you,Received ye the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing offaith? 

{3:3} Are ye so foolish? having begun in the Spirit, are ye nowmade perfect by the flesh? 

{3:4} Have ye suffered so many things invain? if [it be] yet in vain. 

{3:5} He therefore that ministereth toyou the Spirit, and worketh miracles among you, [doeth he it] by theworks of the law, or by the hearing of faith? 

{3:6} Even as Abrahambelieved God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness.   

{3:7} Know ye therefore that they which are of faith, the same arethe children of Abraham. 

{3:8} And the scripture, foreseeing that Godwould justify the heathen through faith, preached before the gospelunto Abraham, [saying,] In thee shall all nations be blessed. 

{3:9} Sothen they which be of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham. 

{3:10}For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse: for itis written, Cursed [is] every one that continueth not in all thingswhich are written in the book of the law to do them. 

{3:11} But that noman is justified by the law in the sight of God, [it is] evident: for,The just shall live by faith. 

{3:12} And the law is not of faith: but,The man that doeth them shall live in them. 

{3:13} Christ hath redeemedus from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it iswritten, Cursed [is] every one that hangeth on a tree: 

{3:14} That theblessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ;that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith. 

{3:15}Brethren, I speak after the manner of men; Though [it be] but a man'scovenant, yet [if it be] confirmed, no man disannulleth, or addeththereto. 

{3:16} Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. Hesaith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed,which is Christ. 

{3:17} And this I say, [that] the covenant, that wasconfirmed before of God in Christ, the law, which was four hundred andthirty years after, cannot disannul, that it should make the promise ofnone effect. 

{3:18} For if the inheritance [be] of the law, [it is] nomore of promise: but God gave [it] to Abraham by promise. 

{3:19}Wherefore then [serveth] the law? It was added because oftransgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise was made;[and it was] ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator. 

{3:20} Now amediator is not [a mediator] of one, but God is one. 

{3:21} [Is] thelaw then against the promises of God? God forbid: for if there had beena law given which could have given life, verily righteousness shouldhave been by the law. 

{3:22} But the scripture hath concluded all undersin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to themthat believe.   

{3:23} But before faith came, we were kept under the law, shut upunto the faith which should afterwards be revealed. 

{3:24} Whereforethe law was our schoolmaster [to bring us] unto Christ, that we mightbe justified by faith. 

{3:25} But after that faith is come, we are nolonger under a schoolmaster. 

{3:26} For ye are all the children of Godby faith in Christ Jesus. 

{3:27} For as many of you as have beenbaptized into Christ have put on Christ. 

{3:28} There is neither Jewnor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male norfemale: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus. 

{3:29} And if ye [be]Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs according to thepromise.   

{4:1} Now I say, [That] the heir, as long as he is a child,differeth nothing from a servant, though he be lord of all; 

{4:2} Butis under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father.

{4:3} Even so we, when we were children, were in bondage under theelements of the world: 

{4:4} But when the fulness of the time was come,God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law, 

{4:5} Toredeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoptionof sons. 

{4:6} And because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spiritof his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father. 

{4:7} Wherefore thouart no more a servant, but a son; and if a son, then an heir of Godthrough Christ.   

{4:8} Howbeit then, when ye knew not God, ye did service unto themwhich by nature are no gods. 

{4:9} But now, after that ye have knownGod, or rather are known of God, how turn ye again to the weak andbeggarly elements, whereunto ye desire again to be in bondage? 

{4:10}Ye observe days, and months, and times, and years. 

{4:11} I am afraidof you, lest I have bestowed upon you labour in vain.   

{4:12} Brethren, I beseech you, be as I [am;] for I [am] as ye[are:] ye have not injured me at all. 

{4:13} Ye know how throughinfirmity of the flesh I preached the gospel unto you at the first.

{4:14} And my temptation which was in my flesh ye despised not, norrejected; but received me as an angel of God, [even] as Christ Jesus.

{4:15} Where is then the blessedness ye spake of? for I bear yourecord, that, if [it had been] possible, ye would have plucked out yourown eyes, and have given them to me. 

{4:16} Am I therefore become yourenemy, because I tell you the truth? 

{4:17} They zealously affect you,[but] not well; yea, they would exclude you, that ye might affect them.

{4:18} But [it is] good to be zealously affected always in [a] good[thing,] and not only when I am present with you. 

{4:19} My littlechildren, of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be formed inyou, 

{4:20} I desire to be present with you now, and to change myvoice; for I stand in doubt of you.   

{4:21} Tell me, ye that desire to be under the law, do ye not hearthe law? 

{4:22} For it is written, that Abraham had two sons, the oneby a bondmaid, the other by a freewoman. 

{4:23} But he [who was] of thebondwoman was born after the flesh; but he of the freewoman [was] bypromise. 

{4:24} Which things are an allegory: for these are the twocovenants; the one from the mount Sinai, which gendereth to bondage,which is Agar. 

{4:25} For this Agar is mount Sinai in Arabia, andanswereth to Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage with herchildren. 

{4:26} But Jerusalem which is above is free, which is themother of us all. 

{4:27} For it is written, Rejoice, [thou] barren thatbearest not; break forth and cry, thou that travailest not: for thedesolate hath many more children than she which hath an husband. 

{4:28}Now we, brethren, as Isaac was, are the children of promise. 

{4:29} Butas then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him [that was born]after the Spirit, even so [it is] now. 

{4:30} Nevertheless what saiththe scripture? Cast out the bondwoman and her son: for the son of thebondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the free woman. 

{4:31} Sothen, brethren, we are not children of the bondwoman, but of the free.   

{5:1} Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath madeus free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage.   

{5:2} Behold, I Paul say unto you, that if ye be circumcised, Christshall profit you nothing. 

{5:3} For I testify again to every man thatis circumcised, that he is a debtor to do the whole law. 

{5:4} Christis become of no effect unto you, whosoever of you are justified by thelaw; ye are fallen from grace. 

{5:5} For we through the Spirit wait forthe hope of righteousness by faith. 

{5:6} For in Jesus Christ neithercircumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision; but faith whichworketh by love. 

{5:7} Ye did run well; who did hinder you that yeshould not obey the truth? 

{5:8} This persuasion [cometh] not of himthat calleth you. 

{5:9} A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump.

{5:10} I have confidence in you through the Lord, that ye will be noneotherwise minded: but he that troubleth you shall bear his judgment,whosoever he be. 

{5:11} And I, brethren, if I yet preach circumcision,why do I yet suffer persecution? then is the offence of the crossceased. 

{5:12} I would they were even cut off which trouble you. 

{5:13}For, brethren, ye have been called unto liberty; only [use] not libertyfor an occasion to the flesh, but by love serve one another. 

{5:14} Forall the law is fulfilled in one word, [even] in this; Thou shalt lovethy neighbour as thyself. 

{5:15} But if ye bite and devour one another,take heed that ye be not consumed one of another. 

{5:16} [This] I saythen, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of theflesh. 

{5:17} For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spiritagainst the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other: so thatye cannot do the things that ye would. 

{5:18} But if ye be led of theSpirit, ye are not under the law. 

{5:19} Now the works of the flesh aremanifest, which are [these;] Adultery, fornication, uncleanness,lasciviousness, 

{5:20} Idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance,emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies, 

{5:21} Envyings,murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like: of the which I tellyou before, as I have also told [you] in time past, that they which dosuch things shall not inherit the kingdom of God. 

{5:22} But the fruitof the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness,faith, 

{5:23} Meekness, temperance: against such there is no law.

{5:24} And they that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with theaffections and lusts. 

{5:25} If we live in the Spirit, let us also walkin the Spirit. 

{5:26} Let us not be desirous of vain glory, provokingone another, envying one another.   

{6:1} Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye which arespiritual, restore such an one in the spirit of meekness; consideringthyself, lest thou also be tempted. 

{6:2} Bear ye one another'sburdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ. 

{6:3} For if a man thinkhimself to be something, when he is nothing, he deceiveth himself.

{6:4} But let every man prove his own work, and then shall he haverejoicing in himself alone, and not in another. 

{6:5} For every manshall bear his own burden. 

{6:6} Let him that is taught in the wordcommunicate unto him that teacheth in all good things. 

{6:7} Be notdeceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall healso reap. 

{6:8} For he that soweth to his flesh shall of the fleshreap corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spiritreap life everlasting. 

{6:9} And let us not be weary in well doing: forin due season we shall reap, if we faint not. 

{6:10} As we havetherefore opportunity, let us do good unto all [men,] especially untothem who are of the household of faith. 

{6:11} Ye see how large aletter I have written unto you with mine own hand. 

{6:12} As many asdesire to make a fair shew in the flesh, they constrain you to becircumcised; only lest they should suffer persecution for the cross ofChrist. 

{6:13} For neither they themselves who are circumcised keep thelaw; but desire to have you circumcised, that they may glory in yourflesh. 

{6:14} But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross ofour Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and Iunto the world. 

{6:15} For in Christ Jesus neither circumcisionavaileth any thing, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature. 

{6:16} Andas many as walk according to this rule, peace [be] on them, and mercy,and upon the Israel of God. 

{6:17} From henceforth let no man troubleme: for I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus. 

{6:18} Brethren,the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ [be] with your spirit. Amen.
