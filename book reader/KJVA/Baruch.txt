{The Book of Baruch   

{1:1} And these are the words of the book, which Baruch the son ofNerias, the son of Maasias, the son of Sedecias, the son of Asadias,the son of Chelcias, wrote in Babylon,   

{1:2} In the fifth year, and in the seventh day of the month, whattime as the Chaldeans took Jerusalem, and burnt it with fire.   

{1:3} And Baruch did read the words of this book in the hearing ofJechonias the son of Joachim king of Juda, and in the ears of all thepeople that came to hear the book,   

{1:4} And in the hearing of the nobles, and of the king's sons, andin the hearing of the elders, and of all the people, from the lowestunto the highest, even of all them that dwelt at Babylon by the riverSud.   

{1:5} Whereupon they wept, fasted, and prayed before the Lord.   

{1:6} They made also a collection of money according to every man'spower:   

{1:7} And they sent it to Jerusalem unto Joachim the high priest,the son of Chelcias, son of Salom, and to the priests, and to all thepeople which were found with him at Jerusalem,   

{1:8} At the same time when he received the vessels of the house ofthe Lord, that were carried out of the temple, to return them into theland of Juda, the tenth day of the month Sivan, namely, silver vessels,which Sedecias the son of Josias king of Jada had made,   

{1:9} After that Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon had carried awayJechonias, and the princes, and the captives, and the mighty men, andthe people of the land, from Jerusalem, and brought them unto Babylon.   

{1:10} And they said, Behold, we have sent you money to buy youburnt offerings, and sin offerings, and incense, and prepare ye manna,and offer upon the altar of the Lord our God;   

{1:11} And pray for the life of Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon, andfor the life of Balthasar his son, that their days may be upon earth asthe days of heaven:   

{1:12} And the Lord will give us strength, and lighten our eyes, andwe shall live under the shadow of Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon, andunder the shadow of Balthasar his son, and we shall serve them manydays, and find favour in their sight.   

{1:13} Pray for us also unto the Lord our God, for we have sinnedagainst the Lord our God; and unto this day the fury of the Lord andhis wrath is not turned from us.   

{1:14} And ye shall read this book which we have sent unto you, tomake confession in the house of the Lord, upon the feasts and solemndays.   

{1:15} And ye shall say, To the Lord our God belongethrighteousness, but unto us the confusion of faces, as it is come topass this day, unto them of Juda, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem,   

{1:16} And to our kings, and to our princes, and to our priests, andto our prophets, and to our fathers:   

{1:17} For we have sinned before the Lord,   

{1:18} And disobeyed him, and have not hearkened unto the voice ofthe Lord our God, to walk in the commandments that he gave us openly:   

{1:19} Since the day that the Lord brought our forefathers out ofthe land of Egypt, unto this present day, we have been disobedient untothe Lord our God, and we have been negligent in not hearing his voice.   

{1:20} Wherefore the evils cleaved unto us, and the curse, which theLord appointed by Moses his servant at the time that he brought ourfathers out of the land of Egypt, to give us a land that floweth withmilk and honey, like as it is to see this day.   

{1:21} Nevertheless we have not hearkened unto the voice of the Lordour God, according unto all the words of the prophets, whom he sentunto us:   

{1:22} But every man followed the imagination of his own wickedheart, to serve strange gods, and to do evil in the sight of the Lordour God.   

{2:1} Therefore the Lord hath made good his word, which hepronounced against us, and against our judges that judged Israel, andagainst our kings, and against our princes, and against the men ofIsrael and Juda,   

{2:2} To bring upon us great plagues, such as never happened underthe whole heaven, as it came to pass in Jerusalem, according to thethings that were written in the law of Moses;   

{2:3} That a man should eat the flesh of his own son, and the fleshof his own daughter.   

{2:4} Moreover he hath delivered them to be in subjection to all thekingdoms that are round about us, to be as a reproach and desolationamong all the people round about, where the Lord hath scattered them.   

{2:5} Thus we were cast down, and not exalted, because we havesinned against the Lord our God, and have not been obedient unto hisvoice.   

{2:6} To the Lord our God appertaineth righteousness: but unto usand to our fathers open shame, as appeareth this day.   

{2:7} For all these plagues are come upon us, which the Lord hathpronounced against us   

{2:8} Yet have we not prayed before the Lord, that we might turnevery one from the imaginations of his wicked heart.   

{2:9} Wherefore the Lord watched over us for evil, and the Lord hathbrought it upon us: for the Lord is righteous in all his works which hehath commanded us.   

{2:10} Yet we have not hearkened unto his voice, to walk in thecommandments of the Lord, that he hath set before us.   

{2:11} And now, O Lord God of Israel, that hast brought thy peopleout of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand, and high arm, and withsigns, and with wonders, and with great power, and hast gotten thyselfa name, as appeareth this day:   

{2:12} O Lord our God, we have sinned, we have done ungodly, we havedealt unrighteously in all thine ordinances.   

{2:13} Let thy wrath turn from us: for we are but a few left amongthe heathen, where thou hast scattered us.   

{2:14} Hear our prayers, O Lord, and our petitions, and deliver usfor thine own sake, and give us favour in the sight of them which haveled us away:   

{2:15} That all the earth may know that thou art the Lord our God,because Israel and his posterity is called by thy name.   

{2:16} O Lord, look down from thine holy house, and consider us: bowdown thine ear, O Lord, to hear us.   

{2:17} Open thine eyes, and behold; for the dead that are in thegraves, whose souls are taken from their bodies, will give unto theLord neither praise nor righteousness:   

{2:18} But the soul that is greatly vexed, which goeth stooping andfeeble, and the eyes that fail, and the hungry soul, will give theepraise and righteousness, O Lord.   

{2:19} Therefore we do not make our humble supplication before thee,O Lord our God, for the righteousness of our fathers, and of our kings.   

{2:20} For thou hast sent out thy wrath and indignation upon us, asthou hast spoken by thy servants the prophets, saying,   

{2:21} Thus saith the Lord, Bow down your shoulders to serve theking of Babylon: so shall ye remain in the land that I gave unto yourfathers.   

{2:22} But if ye will not hear the voice of the Lord, to serve theking of Babylon,   

{2:23} I will cause to cease out of the cites of Judah, and fromwithout Jerusalem, the voice of mirth, and the voice of joy, the voiceof the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride: and the whole land shallbe desolate of inhabitants.   

{2:24} But we would not hearken unto thy voice, to serve the king ofBabylon: therefore hast thou made good the words that thou spakest bythy servants the prophets, namely, that the bones of our kings, and thebones of our fathers, should be taken out of their place.   

{2:25} And, lo, they are cast out to the heat of the day, and to thefrost of the night, and they died in great miseries by famine, bysword, and by pestilence.   

{2:26} And the house which is called by thy name hast thou laidwaste, as it is to be seen this day, for the wickedness of the house ofIsrael and the house of Juda.   

{2:27} O Lord our God, thou hast dealt with us after all thygoodness, and according to all that great mercy of thine,   

{2:28} As thou spakest by thy servant Moses in the day when thoudidst command him to write the law before the children of Israel,saying,   

{2:29} If ye will not hear my voice, surely this very greatmultitude shall be turned into a small number among the nations, whereI will scatter them.   

{2:30} For I knew that they would not hear me, because it is astiffnecked people: but in the land of their captivities they shallremember themselves.   

{2:31} And shall know that I am the Lord their God: for I will givethem an heart, and ears to hear:   

{2:32} And they shall praise me in the land of their captivity, andthink upon my name,   

{2:33} And return from their stiff neck, and from their wickeddeeds: for they shall remember the way of their fathers, which sinnedbefore the Lord.   

{2:34} And I will bring them again into the land which I promisedwith an oath unto their fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and theyshall be lords of it: and I will increase them, and they shall not bediminished.   

{2:35} And I will make an everlasting covenant with them to be theirGod, and they shall be my people: and I will no more drive my people ofIsrael out of the land that I have given them.   

{3:1} O Lord Almighty, God of Israel, the soul in anguish thetroubled spirit, crieth unto thee.   

{3:2} Hear, O Lord, and have mercy; ar thou art merciful: and havepity upon us, because we have sinned before thee.   

{3:3} For thou endurest for ever, and we perish utterly.   

{3:4} O Lord Almighty, thou God of Israel, hear now the prayers ofthe dead Israelites, and of their children, which have sinned beforethee, and not hearkened unto the voice of thee their God: for the whichcause these plagues cleave unto us.   

{3:5} Remember not the iniquities of our forefathers: but think uponthy power and thy name now at this time.   

{3:6} For thou art the Lord our God, and thee, O Lord, will wepraise.   

{3:7} And for this cause thou hast put thy fear in our hearts, tothe intent that we should call upon thy name, and praise thee in ourcaptivity: for we have called to mind all the iniquity of ourforefathers, that sinned before thee.   

{3:8} Behold, we are yet this day in our captivity, where thou hastscattered us, for a reproach and a curse, and to be subject topayments, according to all the iniquities of our fathers, whichdeparted from the Lord our God.   

{3:9} Hear, Israel, the commandments of life: give ear to understandwisdom.   

{3:10} How happeneth it Israel, that thou art in thine enemies'land, that thou art waxen old in a strange country, that thou artdefiled with the dead,   

{3:11} That thou art counted with them that go down into the grave?   

{3:12} Thou hast forsaken the fountain of wisdom.   

{3:13} For if thou hadst walked in the way of God, thou shouldesthave dwelled in peace for ever.   

{3:14} Learn where is wisdom, where is strength, where isunderstanding; that thou mayest know also where is length of days, andlife, where is the light of the eyes, and peace.   

{3:15} Who hath found out her place? or who hath come into hertreasures ?   

{3:16} Where are the princes of the heathen become, and such asruled the beasts upon the earth;   

{3:17} They that had their pastime with the fowls of the air, andthey that hoarded up silver and gold, wherein men trust, and made noend of their getting?   

{3:18} For they that wrought in silver, and were so careful, andwhose works are unsearchable,   

{3:19} They are vanished and gone down to the grave, and others arecome up in their steads.   

{3:20} Young men have seen light, and dwelt upon the earth: but theway of knowledge have they not known,   

{3:21} Nor understood the paths thereof, nor laid hold of it: theirchildren were far off from that way.   

{3:22} It hath not been heard of in Chanaan, neither hath it beenseen in Theman.   

{3:23} The Agarenes that seek wisdom upon earth, the merchants ofMeran and of Theman, the authors of fables, and searchers out ofunderstanding; none of these have known the way of wisdom, or rememberher paths.   

{3:24} O Israel, how great is the house of God! and how large is theplace of his possession!   

{3:25} Great, and hath none end; high, and unmeasurable.   

{3:26} There were the giants famous from the beginning, that were ofso great stature, and so expert in war.   

{3:27} Those did not the Lord choose, neither gave he the way ofknowledge unto them:   

{3:28} But they were destroyed, because they had no wisdom, andperished through their own foolishness.   

{3:29} Who hath gone up into heaven, and taken her, and brought herdown from the clouds?   

{3:30} Who hath gone over the sea, and found her, and will bring herfor pure gold?   

{3:31} No man knoweth her way, nor thinketh of her path.   

{3:32} But he that knoweth all things knoweth her, and hath foundher out with his understanding: he that prepared the earth for evermorehath filled it with fourfooted beasts:   

{3:33} He that sendeth forth light, and it goeth, calleth it again,and it obeyeth him with fear.   

{3:34} The stars shined in their watches, and rejoiced: when hecalleth them, they say, Here we be; and so with cheerfulness theyshewed light unto him that made them.   

{3:35} This is our God, and there shall none other be accounted ofin comparison of him   

{3:36} He hath found out all the way of knowledge, and hath given itunto Jacob his servant, and to Israel his beloved.   

{3:37} Afterward did he shew himself upon earth, and conversed withmen.   

{4:1} This is the book of the commandments of God, and the law thatendureth for ever: all they that keep it shall come to life; but suchas leave it shall die.   

{4:2} Turn thee, O Jacob, and take hold of it: walk in the presenceof the light thereof, that thou mayest be illuminated.   

{4:3} Give not thine honour to another, nor the things that areprofitable unto thee to a strange nation.   

{4:4} O Israel, happy are we: for things that are pleasing to Godare made known unto us.   

{4:5} Be of good cheer, my people, the memorial of Israel.   

{4:6} Ye were sold to the nations, not for [your] destruction: butbecause ye moved God to wrath, ye were delivered unto the enemies.   

{4:7} For ye provoked him that made you by sacrificing unto devils,and not to God.   

{4:8} Ye have forgotten the everlasting God, that brought you up;and ye have grieved Jerusalem, that nursed you.   

{4:9} For when she saw the wrath of God coming upon you, she said,Hearken, O ye that dwell about Sion: God hath brought upon me greatmourning;   

{4:10} For I saw the captivity of my sons and daughters, which theEverlasting brought upon them.   

{4:11} With joy did I nourish them; but sent them away with weepingand mourning.   

{4:12} Let no man rejoice over me, a widow, and forsaken of many,who for the sins of my children am left desolate; because they departedfrom the law of God.   

{4:13} They knew not his statutes, nor walked in the ways of hiscommandments, nor trod in the paths of discipline in his righteousness.   

{4:14} Let them that dwell about Sion come, and remember ye thecaptivity of my sons and daughters, which the Everlasting hath broughtupon them.   

{4:15} For he hath brought a nation upon them from far, a shamelessnation, and of a strange language, who neither reverenced old man, norpitied child.   

{4:16} These have carried away the dear beloved children of thewidow, and left her that was alone desolate without daughters.   

{4:17} But what can I help you?   

{4:18} For he that brought these plagues upon you will deliver youfrom the hands of your enemies.   

{4:19} Go your way, O my children, go your way: for I am leftdesolate.   

{4:20} I have put off the clothing of peace, and put upon me thesackcloth of my prayer: I will cry unto the Everlasting in my days.   

{4:21} Be of good cheer, O my children, cry unto the Lord, and hewill deliver you from the power and hand of the enemies.   

{4:22} For my hope is in the Everlasting, that he will save you; andjoy is come unto me from the Holy One, because of the mercy which shallsoon come unto you from the Everlasting our Saviour.   

{4:23} For I sent you out with mourning and weeping: but God willgive you to me again with joy and gladness for ever.   

{4:24} Like as now the neighbours of Sion have seen your captivity:so shall they see shortly your salvation from our God which shall comeupon you with great glory, and brightness of the Everlasting.   

{4:25} My children, suffer patiently the wrath that is come upon youfrom God: for thine enemy hath persecuted thee; but shortly thou shaltsee his destruction, and shalt tread upon his neck.   

{4:26} My delicate ones have gone rough ways, and were taken away asa flock caught of the enemies.   

{4:27} Be of good comfort, O my children, and cry unto God: for yeshall be remembered of him that brought these things upon you.   

{4:28} For as it was your mind to go astray from God: so, beingreturned, seek him ten times more.   

{4:29} For he that hath brought these plagues upon you shall bringyou everlasting joy with your salvation.   

{4:30} Take a good heart, O Jerusalem: for he that gave thee thatname will comfort thee.   

{4:31} Miserable are they that afflicted thee, and rejoiced at thyfall.   

{4:32} Miserable are the cities which thy children served: miserableis she that received thy sons.   

{4:33} For as she rejoiced at thy ruin, and was glad of thy fall: soshall she be grieved for her own desolation.   

{4:34} For I will take away the rejoicing of her great multitude,and her pride shall be turned into mourning.   

{4:35} For fire shall come upon her from the Everlasting, long toendure; and she shall be inhabited of devils for a great time.   

{4:36} O Jerusalem, look about thee toward the east, and behold thejoy that cometh unto thee from God.   

{4:37} Lo, thy sons come, whom thou sentest away, they come gatheredtogether from the east to the west by the word of the Holy One,rejoicing in the glory of God.   

{5:1} Put off, O Jerusalem, the garment of mourning and affliction,and put on the comeliness of the glory that cometh from God for ever.   

{5:2} Cast about thee a double garment of the righteousness whichcometh from God; and set a diadem on thine head of the glory of theEverlasting.   

{5:3} For God will shew thy brightness unto every country underheaven.   

{5:4} For thy name shall be called of God for ever The peace ofrighteousness, and The glory of God's worship.   

{5:5} Arise, O Jerusalem, and stand on high, and look about towardthe east, and behold thy children gathered from the west unto the eastby the word of the Holy One, rejoicing in the remembrance of God.   

{5:6} For they departed from thee on foot, and were led away oftheir enemies: but God bringeth them unto thee exalted with glory, aschildren of the kingdom.   

{5:7} For God hath appointed that every high hill, and banks of longcontinuance, should be cast down, and valleys filled up, to make eventhe ground, that Israel may go safely in the glory of God,   

{5:8} Moreover even the woods and every sweetsmelling tree shallovershadow Israel by the commandment of God.   

{5:9} For God shall lead Israel with joy in the light of his glorywith the mercy and righteousness that cometh from him.
