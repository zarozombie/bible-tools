{The Second Book of Samuel Otherwise Called the Second Book of the Kings   

{1:1} Now it came to pass after the death of Saul, when David wasreturned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David had abode twodays in Ziklag; 

{1:2} It came even to pass on the third day, that,behold, a man came out of the camp from Saul with his clothes rent, andearth upon his head: and [so] it was, when he came to David, that hefell to the earth, and did obeisance. 

{1:3} And David said unto him,From whence comest thou? And he said unto him, Out of the camp ofIsrael am I escaped. 

{1:4} And David said unto him, How went thematter? I pray thee, tell me. And he answered, That the people are fledfrom the battle, and many of the people also are fallen and dead; andSaul and Jonathan his son are dead also. 

{1:5} And David said unto theyoung man that told him, How knowest thou that Saul and Jonathan hisson be dead? 

{1:6} And the young man that told him said, As I happenedby chance upon mount Gilboa, behold, Saul leaned upon his spear; and,lo, the chariots and horsemen followed hard after him. 

{1:7} And whenhe looked behind him, he saw me, and called unto me. And I answered,Here [am] I. 

{1:8} And he said unto me, Who [art] thou? And I answeredhim, I [am] an Amalekite. 

{1:9} And he said unto me again, Stand, Ipray thee, upon me, and slay me: for anguish is come upon me, becausemy life [is] yet whole in me. 

{1:10} So I stood upon him, and slew him,because I was sure that he could not live after that he was fallen: andI took the crown that [was] upon his head, and the bracelet that [was]on his arm, and have brought them hither unto my lord. 

{1:11} ThenDavid took hold on his clothes, and rent them; and likewise all the menthat [were] with him: 

{1:12} And they mourned, and wept, and fasteduntil even, for Saul, and for Jonathan his son, and for the people ofthe LORD, and for the house of Israel; because they were fallen by thesword.   

{1:13} And David said unto the young man that told him, Whence [art]thou? And he answered, I [am] the son of a stranger, an Amalekite.

{1:14} And David said unto him, How wast thou not afraid to stretchforth thine hand to destroy the LORD'S anointed? 

{1:15} And Davidcalled one of the young men, and said, Go near, [and] fall upon him.And he smote him that he died. 

{1:16} And David said unto him, Thyblood [be] upon thy head; for thy mouth hath testified against thee,saying, I have slain the LORD'S anointed.   

{1:17} And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and overJonathan his son: 

{1:18} (Also he bade them teach the children of Judah[the use of] the bow: behold, it is written in the book of Jasher.)

{1:19} The beauty of Israel is slain upon thy high places: how are themighty fallen! 

{1:20} Tell [it] not in Gath, publish [it] not in thestreets of Askelon; lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, lestthe daughters of the uncircumcised triumph. 

{1:21} Ye mountains ofGilboa, [let there be] no dew, neither [let there be] rain, upon you,nor fields of offerings: for there the shield of the mighty is vilelycast away, the shield of Saul, [as though he had] not [been] anointedwith oil. 

{1:22} From the blood of the slain, from the fat of themighty, the bow of Jonathan turned not back, and the sword of Saulreturned not empty. 

{1:23} Saul and Jonathan [were] lovely and pleasantin their lives, and in their death they were not divided: they wereswifter than eagles, they were stronger than lions. 

{1:24} Ye daughtersof Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you in scarlet, with [other]delights, who put on ornaments of gold upon your apparel. 

{1:25} Howare the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle! O Jonathan, [thouwast] slain in thine high places. 

{1:26} I am distressed for thee, mybrother Jonathan: very pleasant hast thou been unto me: thy love to mewas wonderful, passing the love of women. 

{1:27} How are the mightyfallen, and the weapons of war perished!   

{2:1} And it came to pass after this, that David enquired of theLORD, saying, Shall I go up into any of the cities of Judah? And theLORD said unto him, Go up. And David said, Whither shall I go up? Andhe said, Unto Hebron. 

{2:2} So David went up thither, and his two wivesalso, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail Nabal's wife the Carmelite.

{2:3} And his men that [were] with him did David bring up, every manwith his household: and they dwelt in the cities of Hebron. 

{2:4} Andthe men of Judah came, and there they anointed David king over thehouse of Judah. And they told David, saying, [That] the men ofJabesh-gilead [were they] that buried Saul.   

{2:5} And David sent messengers unto the men of Jabesh-gilead, andsaid unto them, Blessed [be] ye of the LORD, that ye have shewed thiskindness unto your lord, [even] unto Saul, and have buried him. 

{2:6}And now the LORD shew kindness and truth unto you: and I also willrequite you this kindness, because ye have done this thing. 

{2:7}Therefore now let your hands be strengthened, and be ye valiant: foryour master Saul is dead, and also the house of Judah have anointed meking over them.   

{2:8} But Abner the son of Ner, captain of Saul's host, tookIsh-bosheth the son of Saul, and brought him over to Mahanaim; 

{2:9}And made him king over Gilead, and over the Ashurites, and overJezreel, and over Ephraim, and over Benjamin, and over all Israel.

{2:10} Ish-bosheth Saul's son [was] forty years old when he began toreign over Israel, and reigned two years. But the house of Judahfollowed David. 

{2:11} And the time that David was king in Hebron overthe house of Judah was seven years and six months.   

{2:12} And Abner the son of Ner, and the servants of Ish-bosheth theson of Saul, went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon. 

{2:13} And Joab the sonof Zeruiah, and the servants of David, went out, and met together bythe pool of Gibeon: and they sat down, the one on the one side of thepool, and the other on the other side of the pool. 

{2:14} And Abnersaid to Joab, Let the young men now arise, and play before us. And Joabsaid, Let them arise. 

{2:15} Then there arose and went over by numbertwelve of Benjamin, which [pertained] to Ish-bosheth the son of Saul,and twelve of the servants of David. 

{2:16} And they caught every onehis fellow by the head, and [thrust] his sword in his fellow's side; sothey fell down together: wherefore that place was calledHelkath-hazzurim, which [is] in Gibeon. 

{2:17} And there was a verysore battle that day; and Abner was beaten, and the men of Israel,before the servants of David.   

{2:18} And there were three sons of Zeruiah there, Joab, andAbishai, and Asahel: and Asahel [was as] light of foot as a wild roe.

{2:19} And Asahel pursued after Abner; and in going he turned not tothe right hand nor to the left from following Abner. 

{2:20} Then Abnerlooked behind him, and said, [Art] thou Asahel? And he answered, I [am.]

{2:21} And Abner said to him, Turn thee aside to thy right hand or tothy left, and lay thee hold on one of the young men, and take thee hisarmour. But Asahel would not turn aside from following of him. 

{2:22}And Abner said again to Asahel, Turn thee aside from following me:wherefore should I smite thee to the ground? how then should I hold upmy face to Joab thy brother? 

{2:23} Howbeit he refused to turn aside:wherefore Abner with the hinder end of the spear smote him under thefifth [rib,] that the spear came out behind him; and he fell downthere, and died in the same place: and it came to pass, [that] as manyas came to the place where Asahel fell down and died stood still.

{2:24} Joab also and Abishai pursued after Abner: and the sun went downwhen they were come to the hill of Ammah, that [lieth] before Giah bythe way of the wilderness of Gibeon.   

{2:25} And the children of Benjamin gathered themselves togetherafter Abner, and became one troop, and stood on the top of an hill.

{2:26} Then Abner called to Joab, and said, Shall the sword devour forever? knowest thou not that it will be bitterness in the latter end?how long shall it be then, ere thou bid the people return fromfollowing their brethren? 

{2:27} And Joab said, [As] God liveth, unlessthou hadst spoken, surely then in the morning the people had gone upevery one from following his brother. 

{2:28} So Joab blew a trumpet,and all the people stood still, and pursued after Israel no more,neither fought they any more. 

{2:29} And Abner and his men walked allthat night through the plain, and passed over Jordan, and went throughall Bithron, and they came to Mahanaim. 

{2:30} And Joab returned fromfollowing Abner: and when he had gathered all the people together,there lacked of David's servants nineteen men and Asahel. 

{2:31} Butthe servants of David had smitten of Benjamin, and of Abner's men, [sothat] three hundred and threescore men died.   

{2:32} And they took up Asahel, and buried him in the sepulchre ofhis father, which [was in] Bethlehem. And Joab and his men went allnight, and they came to Hebron at break of day.   

{3:1} Now there was long war between the house of Saul and the houseof David: but David waxed stronger and stronger, and the house of Saulwaxed weaker and weaker.   

{3:2} And unto David were sons born in Hebron: and his firstborn wasAmnon, of Ahinoam the Jezreelitess; 

{3:3} And his second, Chileab, ofAbigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite; and the third, Absalom the sonof Maacah the daughter of Talmai king of Geshur; 

{3:4} And the fourth,Adonijah the son of Haggith; and the fifth, Shephatiah the son ofAbital; 

{3:5} And the sixth, Ithream, by Eglah David's wife. These wereborn to David in Hebron.   

{3:6} And it came to pass, while there was war between the house ofSaul and the house of David, that Abner made himself strong for thehouse of Saul. 

{3:7} And Saul had a concubine, whose name [was] Rizpah,the daughter of Aiah: and [Ish-bosheth] said to Abner, Wherefore hastthou gone in unto my father's concubine? 

{3:8} Then was Abner verywroth for the words of Ish-bosheth, and said, [Am] I a dog's head,which against Judah do shew kindness this day unto the house of Saulthy father, to his brethren, and to his friends, and have not deliveredthee into the hand of David, that thou chargest me to day with a faultconcerning this woman? 

{3:9} So do God to Abner, and more also, except,as the LORD hath sworn to David, even so I do to him; 

{3:10} Totranslate the kingdom from the house of Saul, and to set up the throneof David over Israel and over Judah, from Dan even to Beer-sheba.

{3:11} And he could not answer Abner a word again, because he fearedhim.   

{3:12} And Abner sent messengers to David on his behalf, saying,Whose [is] the land? saying [also,] Make thy league with me, and,behold, my hand [shall be] with thee, to bring about all Israel untothee.   

{3:13} And he said, Well; I will make a league with thee: but onething I require of thee, that is, Thou shalt not see my face, exceptthou first bring Michal Saul's daughter, when thou comest to see myface. 

{3:14} And David sent messengers to Ish-bosheth Saul's son,saying, Deliver [me] my wife Michal, which I espoused to me for anhundred foreskins of the Philistines. 

{3:15} And Ish-bosheth sent, andtook her from [her] husband, [even] from Phaltiel the son of Laish.

{3:16} And her husband went with her along weeping behind her toBahurim. Then said Abner unto him, Go, return. And he returned.   

{3:17} And Abner had communication with the elders of Israel,saying, Ye sought for David in times past [to be] king over you: 

{3:18}Now then do [it:] for the LORD hath spoken of David, saying, By thehand of my servant David I will save my people Israel out of the handof the Philistines, and out of the hand of all their enemies. 

{3:19}And Abner also spake in the ears of Benjamin: and Abner went also tospeak in the ears of David in Hebron all that seemed good to Israel,and that seemed good to the whole house of Benjamin. 

{3:20} So Abnercame to David to Hebron, and twenty men with him. And David made Abnerand the men that [were] with him a feast. 

{3:21} And Abner said untoDavid, I will arise and go, and will gather all Israel unto my lord theking, that they may make a league with thee, and that thou mayest reignover all that thine heart desireth. And David sent Abner away; and hewent in peace.   

{3:22} And, Behold, the servants of David and Joab came from[pursuing] a troop, and brought in a great spoil with them: but Abner[was] not with David in Hebron; for he had sent him away, and he wasgone in peace. 

{3:23} When Joab and all the host that [was] with himwere come, they told Joab, saying, Abner the son of Ner came to theking, and he hath sent him away, and he is gone in peace. 

{3:24} ThenJoab came to the king, and said, What hast thou done? behold, Abnercame unto thee; why [is] it [that] thou hast sent him away, and he isquite gone? 

{3:25} Thou knowest Abner the son of Ner, that he came todeceive thee, and to know thy going out and thy coming in, and to knowall that thou doest. 

{3:26} And when Joab was come out from David, hesent messengers after Abner, which brought him again from the well ofSirah: but David knew [it] not. 

{3:27} And when Abner was returned toHebron, Joab took him aside in the gate to speak with him quietly, andsmote him there under the fifth [rib,] that he died, for the blood ofAsahel his brother.   

{3:28} And afterward when David heard [it,] he said, I and mykingdom [are] guiltless before the LORD for ever from the blood ofAbner the son of Ner: 

{3:29} Let it rest on the head of Joab, and onall his father's house; and let there not fail from the house of Joabone that hath an issue, or that is a leper, or that leaneth on a staff,or that falleth on the sword, or that lacketh bread. 

{3:30} So Joab andAbishai his brother slew Abner, because he had slain their brotherAsahel at Gibeon in the battle.   

{3:31} And David said to Joab, and to all the people that [were]with him, Rend your clothes, and gird you with sackcloth, and mournbefore Abner. And king David [himself] followed the bier. 

{3:32} Andthey buried Abner in Hebron: and the king lifted up his voice, and weptat the grave of Abner; and all the people wept. 

{3:33} And the kinglamented over Abner, and said, Died Abner as a fool dieth? 

{3:34} Thyhands [were] not bound, nor thy feet put into fetters: as a man fallethbefore wicked men, [so] fellest thou. And all the people wept againover him. 

{3:35} And when all the people came to cause David to eatmeat while it was yet day, David sware, saying, So do God to me, andmore also, if I taste bread, or ought else, till the sun be down.

{3:36} And all the people took notice [of it,] and it pleased them: aswhatsoever the king did pleased all the people. 

{3:37} For all thepeople and all Israel understood that day that it was not of the kingto slay Abner the son of Ner. 

{3:38} And the king said unto hisservants, Know ye not that there is a prince and a great man fallenthis day in Israel? 

{3:39} And I [am] this day weak, though anointedking; and these men the sons of Zeruiah [be] too hard for me: the LORDshall reward the doer of evil according to his wickedness.   

{4:1} And when Saul's son heard that Abner was dead in Hebron, hishands were feeble, and all the Israelites were troubled. 

{4:2} AndSaul's son had two men [that were] captains of bands: the name of theone [was] Baanah, and the name of the other Rechab, the sons of Rimmona Beerothite, of the children of Benjamin: (for Beeroth also wasreckoned to Benjamin: 

{4:3} And the Beerothites fled to Gittaim, andwere sojourners there until this day.) 

{4:4} And Jonathan, Saul's son,had a son [that was] lame of [his] feet. He was five years old when thetidings came of Saul and Jonathan out of Jezreel, and his nurse tookhim up, and fled: and it came to pass, as she made haste to flee, thathe fell, and became lame. And his name [was] Mephibosheth. 

{4:5} Andthe sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah, went, and cameabout the heat of the day to the house of Ish-bosheth, who lay on a bedat noon. 

{4:6} And they came thither into the midst of the house, [asthough] they would have fetched wheat; and they smote him under thefifth [rib:] and Rechab and Baanah his brother escaped. 

{4:7} For whenthey came into the house, he lay on his bed in his bedchamber, and theysmote him, and slew him, and beheaded him, and took his head, and gatthem away through the plain all night. 

{4:8} And they brought the headof Ish-bosheth unto David to Hebron, and said to the king, Behold thehead of Ish-bosheth the son of Saul thine enemy, which sought thy life;and the LORD hath avenged my lord the king this day of Saul, and of hisseed.   

{4:9} And David answered Rechab and Baanah his brother, the sons ofRimmon the Beerothite, and said unto them, As the LORD liveth, who hathredeemed my soul out of all adversity, 

{4:10} When one told me, saying,Behold, Saul is dead, thinking to have brought good tidings, I tookhold of him, and slew him in Ziklag, who [thought] that I would havegiven him a reward for his tidings: 

{4:11} How much more, when wickedmen have slain a righteous person in his own house upon his bed? shallI not therefore now require his blood of your hand, and take you awayfrom the earth? 

{4:12} And David commanded his young men, and they slewthem, and cut off their hands and their feet, and hanged [them] up overthe pool in Hebron. But they took the head of Ish-bosheth, and buried[it] in the sepulchre of Abner in Hebron.   

{5:1} Then came all the tribes of Israel to David unto Hebron, andspake, saying, Behold, we [are] thy bone and thy flesh. 

{5:2} Also intime past, when Saul was king over us, thou wast he that leddest outand broughtest in Israel: and the LORD said to thee, Thou shalt feed mypeople Israel, and thou shalt be a captain over Israel. 

{5:3} So allthe elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron; and king David made aleague with them in Hebron before the LORD: and they anointed Davidking over Israel.   

{5:4} David [was] thirty years old when he began to reign, [and] hereigned forty years. 

{5:5} In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven yearsand six months: and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty and three years overall Israel and Judah.   

{5:6} And the king and his men went to Jerusalem unto the Jebusites,the inhabitants of the land: which spake unto David, saying, Exceptthou take away the blind and the lame, thou shalt not come in hither:thinking, David cannot come in hither. 

{5:7} Nevertheless David tookthe strong hold of Zion: the same [is] the city of David. 

{5:8} AndDavid said on that day, Whosoever getteth up to the gutter, and smiteththe Jebusites, and the lame and the blind, [that are] hated of David'ssoul, [he shall be chief and captain.] Wherefore they said, The blindand the lame shall not come into the house. 

{5:9} So David dwelt in thefort, and called it the city of David. And David built round about fromMillo and inward. 

{5:10} And David went on, and grew great, and theLORD God of hosts [was] with him.   

{5:11} And Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedartrees, and carpenters, and masons: and they built David an house.

{5:12} And David perceived that the LORD had established him king overIsrael, and that he had exalted his kingdom for his people Israel'ssake.   

{5:13} And David took [him] more concubines and wives out ofJerusalem, after he was come from Hebron: and there were yet sons anddaughters born to David. 

{5:14} And these [be] the names of those thatwere born unto him in Jerusalem; Shammuah, and Shobab, and Nathan, andSolomon, 

{5:15} Ibhar also, and Elishua, and Nepheg, and Japhia, 

{5:16}And Elishama, and Eliada, and Eliphalet.   

{5:17} But when the Philistines heard that they had anointed Davidking over Israel, all the Philistines came up to seek David; and Davidheard [of it,] and went down to the hold. 

{5:18} The Philistines alsocame and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim. 

{5:19} And Davidenquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go up to the Philistines? wiltthou deliver them into mine hand? And the LORD said unto David, Go up:for I will doubtless deliver the Philistines into thine hand. 

{5:20}And David came to Baal-perazim, and David smote them there, and said,The LORD hath broken forth upon mine enemies before me, as the breachof waters. Therefore he called the name of that place Baal-perazim.

{5:21} And there they left their images, and David and his men burnedthem.   

{5:22} And the Philistines came up yet again, and spread themselvesin the valley of Rephaim. 

{5:23} And when David enquired of the LORD,he said, Thou shalt not go up; [but] fetch a compass behind them, andcome upon them over against the mulberry trees. 

{5:24} And let it be,when thou hearest the sound of a going in the tops of the mulberrytrees, that then thou shalt bestir thyself: for then shall the LORD goout before thee, to smite the host of the Philistines. 

{5:25} And Daviddid so, as the LORD had commanded him; and smote the Philistines fromGeba until thou come to Gazer.   

{6:1} Again, David gathered together all [the] chosen [men] ofIsrael, thirty thousand. 

{6:2} And David arose, and went with all thepeople that [were] with him from Baale of Judah, to bring up fromthence the ark of God, whose name is called by the name of the LORD ofhosts that dwelleth [between] the cherubims. 

{6:3} And they set the arkof God upon a new cart, and brought it out of the house of Abinadabthat [was] in Gibeah: and Uzzah and Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, dravethe new cart. 

{6:4} And they brought it out of the house of Abinadabwhich [was] at Gibeah, accompanying the ark of God: and Ahio wentbefore the ark. 

{6:5} And David and all the house of Israel playedbefore the LORD on all manner of [instruments made of] fir wood, evenon harps, and on psalteries, and on timbrels, and on cornets, and oncymbals.   

{6:6} And when they came to Nachon's threshingfloor, Uzzah put forth[his hand] to the ark of God, and took hold of it; for the oxen shook[it. ]

{6:7} And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Uzzah; andGod smote him there for [his] error; and there he died by the ark ofGod. 

{6:8} And David was displeased, because the LORD had made a breachupon Uzzah: and he called the name of the place Perez-uzzah to thisday. 

{6:9} And David was afraid of the LORD that day, and said, Howshall the ark of the LORD come to me? 

{6:10} So David would not removethe ark of the LORD unto him into the city of David: but David carriedit aside into the house of Obed-edom the Gittite. 

{6:11} And the ark ofthe LORD continued in the house of Obed-edom the Gittite three months:and the LORD blessed Obed-edom, and all his household.   

{6:12} And it was told king David, saying, The LORD hath blessed thehouse of Obed- edom, and all that [pertaineth] unto him, because of theark of God. So David went and brought up the ark of God from the houseof Obed-edom into the city of David with gladness. 

{6:13} And it was[so,] that when they that bare the ark of the LORD had gone six paces,he sacrificed oxen and fatlings. 

{6:14} And David danced before theLORD with all [his] might; and David [was] girded with a linen ephod.

{6:15} So David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of theLORD with shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet. 

{6:16} And asthe ark of the LORD came into the city of David, Michal Saul's daughterlooked through a window, and saw king David leaping and dancing beforethe LORD; and she despised him in her heart.   

{6:17} And they brought in the ark of the LORD, and set it in hisplace, in the midst of the tabernacle that David had pitched for it:and David offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the LORD.

{6:18} And as soon as David had made an end of offering burnt offeringsand peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD ofhosts. 

{6:19} And he dealt among all the people, [even] among the wholemultitude of Israel, as well to the women as men, to every one a cakeof bread, and a good piece [of flesh,] and a flagon [of wine.] So allthe people departed every one to his house.   

{6:20} Then David returned to bless his household. And Michal thedaughter of Saul came out to meet David, and said, How glorious was theking of Israel today, who uncovered himself to day in the eyes of thehandmaids of his servants, as one of the vain fellows shamelesslyuncovereth himself! 

{6:21} And David said unto Michal, [It was] beforethe LORD, which chose me before thy father, and before all his house,to appoint me ruler over the people of the LORD, over Israel: thereforewill I play before the LORD. 

{6:22} And I will yet be more vile thanthus, and will be base in mine own sight: and of the maidservants whichthou hast spoken of, of them shall I be had in honour. 

{6:23} ThereforeMichal the daughter of Saul had no child unto the day of her death.   

{7:1} And it came to pass, when the king sat in his house, and theLORD had given him rest round about from all his enemies; 

{7:2} Thatthe king said unto Nathan the prophet, See now, I dwell in an house ofcedar, but the ark of God dwelleth within curtains. 

{7:3} And Nathansaid to the king, Go, do all that [is] in thine heart; for the LORD[is] with thee.   

{7:4} And it came to pass that night, that the word of the LORD cameunto Nathan, saying, 

{7:5} Go and tell my servant David, Thus saith theLORD, Shalt thou build me an house for me to dwell in? 

{7:6} Whereas Ihave not dwelt in [any] house since the time that I brought up thechildren of Israel out of Egypt, even to this day, but have walked in atent and in a tabernacle. 

{7:7} In all [the places] wherein I havewalked with all the children of Israel spake I a word with any of thetribes of Israel, whom I commanded to feed my people Israel, saying,Why build ye not me an house of cedar? 

{7:8} Now therefore so shaltthou say unto my servant David, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, I tookthee from the sheepcote, from following the sheep, to be ruler over mypeople, over Israel: 

{7:9} And I was with thee whithersoever thouwentest, and have cut off all thine enemies out of thy sight, and havemade thee a great name, like unto the name of the great [men] that[are] in the earth. 

{7:10} Moreover I will appoint a place for mypeople Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in a place oftheir own, and move no more; neither shall the children of wickednessafflict them any more, as beforetime, 

{7:11} And as since the time thatI commanded judges [to be] over my people Israel, and have caused theeto rest from all thine enemies. Also the LORD telleth thee that he willmake thee an house.   

{7:12} And when thy days be fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thyfathers, I will set up thy seed after thee, which shall proceed out ofthy bowels, and I will establish his kingdom. 

{7:13} He shall build anhouse for my name, and I will stablish the throne of his kingdom forever. 

{7:14} I will be his father, and he shall be my son. If he commitiniquity, I will chasten him with the rod of men, and with the stripesof the children of men: 

{7:15} But my mercy shall not depart away fromhim, as I took [it] from Saul, whom I put away before thee. 

{7:16} Andthine house and thy kingdom shall be established for ever before thee:thy throne shall be established for ever. 

{7:17} According to all thesewords, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak unto David.   

{7:18} Then went king David in, and sat before the LORD, and hesaid, Who [am] I, O Lord GOD? and what [is] my house, that thou hastbrought me hitherto? 

{7:19} And this was yet a small thing in thysight, O Lord GOD; but thou hast spoken also of thy servant's house fora great while to come. And [is] this the manner of man, O Lord GOD?

{7:20} And what can David say more unto thee? for thou, Lord GOD,knowest thy servant. 

{7:21} For thy word's sake, and according to thineown heart, hast thou done all these great things, to make thy servantknow [them. ]

{7:22} Wherefore thou art great, O LORD God: for [thereis] none like thee, neither [is there any] God beside thee, accordingto all that we have heard with our ears. 

{7:23} And what one nation inthe earth [is] like thy people, [even] like Israel, whom God went toredeem for a people to himself, and to make him a name, and to do foryou great things and terrible, for thy land, before thy people, whichthou redeemedst to thee from Egypt, [from] the nations and their gods?

{7:24} For thou hast confirmed to thyself thy people Israel [to be] apeople unto thee for ever: and thou, LORD, art become their God. 

{7:25}And now, O LORD God, the word that thou hast spoken concerning thyservant, and concerning his house, establish [it] for ever, and do asthou hast said. 

{7:26} And let thy name be magnified for ever, saying,The LORD of hosts [is] the God over Israel: and let the house of thyservant David be established before thee. 

{7:27} For thou, O LORD ofhosts, God of Israel, hast revealed to thy servant, saying, I willbuild thee an house: therefore hath thy servant found in his heart topray this prayer unto thee. 

{7:28} And now, O Lord GOD, thou [art] thatGod, and thy words be true, and thou hast promised this goodness untothy servant: 

{7:29} Therefore now let it please thee to bless the houseof thy servant, that it may continue for ever before thee: for thou, OLord GOD, hast spoken [it:] and with thy blessing let the house of thyservant be blessed for ever.   

{8:1} And after this it came to pass, that David smote thePhilistines, and subdued them: and David took Metheg-ammah out of thehand of the Philistines. 

{8:2} And he smote Moab, and measured themwith a line, casting them down to the ground; even with two linesmeasured he to put to death, and with one full line to keep alive. Andso the Moabites became David's servants, [and] brought gifts.   

{8:3} David smote also Hadadezer, the son of Rehob, king of Zobah,as he went to recover his border at the river Euphrates. 

{8:4} AndDavid took from him a thousand [chariots,] and seven hundred horsemen,and twenty thousand footmen: and David houghed all the chariot[horses,] but reserved of them [for] an hundred chariots. 

{8:5} Andwhen the Syrians of Damascus came to succour Hadadezer king of Zobah,David slew of the Syrians two and twenty thousand men. 

{8:6} Then Davidput garrisons in Syria of Damascus: and the Syrians became servants toDavid, [and] brought gifts. And the LORD preserved David whithersoeverhe went. 

{8:7} And David took the shields of gold that were on theservants of Hadadezer, and brought them to Jerusalem. 

{8:8} And fromBetah, and from Berothai, cities of Hadadezer, king David tookexceeding much brass.   

{8:9} When Toi king of Hamath heard that David had smitten all thehost of Hadadezer, 

{8:10} Then Toi sent Joram his son unto king David,to salute him, and to bless him, because he had fought againstHadadezer, and smitten him: for Hadadezer had wars with Toi. And[Joram] brought with him vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, andvessels of brass: 

{8:11} Which also king David did dedicate unto theLORD, with the silver and gold that he had dedicated of all nationswhich he subdued; 

{8:12} Of Syria, and of Moab, and of the children ofAmmon, and of the Philistines, and of Amalek, and of the spoil ofHadadezer, son of Rehob, king of Zobah. 

{8:13} And David gat [him] aname when he returned from smiting of the Syrians in the valley ofsalt, [being] eighteen thousand [men.]   

{8:14} And he put garrisons in Edom; throughout all Edom put hegarrisons, and all they of Edom became David's servants. And the LORDpreserved David whithersoever he went. 

{8:15} And David reigned overall Israel; and David executed judgment and justice unto all hispeople. 

{8:16} And Joab the son of Zeruiah [was] over the host; andJehoshaphat the son of Ahilud [was] recorder; 

{8:17} And Zadok the sonof Ahitub, and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, [were] the priests; andSeraiah [was] the scribe; 

{8:18} And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada [wasover] both the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and David's sons werechief rulers.   

{9:1} And David said, Is there yet any that is left of the house ofSaul, that I may shew him kindness for Jonathan's sake? 

{9:2} And[there was] of the house of Saul a servant whose name [was] Ziba. Andwhen they had called him unto David, the king said unto him, [Art] thouZiba? And he said, Thy servant [is he. ]

{9:3} And the king said, [Is]there not yet any of the house of Saul, that I may shew the kindness ofGod unto him? And Ziba said unto the king, Jonathan hath yet a son,[which is] lame on [his] feet. 

{9:4} And the king said unto him, Where[is] he? And Ziba said unto the king, Behold, he [is] in the house ofMachir, the son of Ammiel, in Lo-debar.   

{9:5} Then king David sent, and fetched him out of the house ofMachir, the son of Ammiel, from Lo-debar. 

{9:6} Now when Mephibosheth,the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, was come unto David, he fell onhis face, and did reverence. And David said, Mephibosheth. And heanswered, Behold thy servant!   

{9:7} And David said unto him, Fear not: for I will surely shew theekindness for Jonathan thy father's sake, and will restore thee all theland of Saul thy father; and thou shalt eat bread at my tablecontinually. 

{9:8} And he bowed himself, and said, What is thy servant,that thou shouldest look upon such a dead dog as I [am?]   

{9:9} Then the king called to Ziba, Saul's servant, and said untohim, I have given unto thy master's son all that pertained to Saul andto all his house. 

{9:10} Thou therefore, and thy sons, and thyservants, shall till the land for him, and thou shalt bring in [thefruits,] that thy master's son may have food to eat: but Mephibosheththy master's son shall eat bread alway at my table. Now Ziba hadfifteen sons and twenty servants. 

{9:11} Then said Ziba unto the king,According to all that my lord the king hath commanded his servant, soshall thy servant do. As for Mephibosheth, [said the king,] he shalleat at my table, as one of the king's sons. 

{9:12} And Mephibosheth hada young son, whose name [was] Micha. And all that dwelt in the house ofZiba [were] servants unto Mephibosheth. 

{9:13} So Mephibosheth dwelt inJerusalem: for he did eat continually at the king's table; and was lameon both his feet.   

{10:1} And it came to pass after this, that the king of the childrenof Ammon died, and Hanun his son reigned in his stead. 

{10:2} Then saidDavid, I will shew kindness unto Hanun the son of Nahash, as his fathershewed kindness unto me. And David sent to comfort him by the hand ofhis servants for his father. And David's servants came into the land ofthe children of Ammon. 

{10:3} And the princes of the children of Ammonsaid unto Hanun their lord, Thinkest thou that David doth honour thyfather, that he hath sent comforters unto thee? hath not David [rather]sent his servants unto thee, to search the city, and to spy it out, andto overthrow it? 

{10:4} Wherefore Hanun took David's servants, andshaved off the one half of their beards, and cut off their garments inthe middle, [even] to their buttocks, and sent them away. 

{10:5} Whenthey told [it] unto David, he sent to meet them, because the men weregreatly ashamed: and the king said, Tarry at Jericho until your beardsbe grown, and [then] return.   

{10:6} And when the children of Ammon saw that they stank beforeDavid, the children of Ammon sent and hired the Syrians of Beth-rehob,and the Syrians of Zoba, twenty thousand footmen, and of king Maacah athousand men, and of Ish-tob twelve thousand men. 

{10:7} And when Davidheard of [it,] he sent Joab, and all the host of the mighty men. 

{10:8}And the children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array at theentering in of the gate: and the Syrians of Zoba, and of Rehob, andIsh-tob, and Maacah, [were] by themselves in the field. 

{10:9} WhenJoab saw that the front of the battle was against him before andbehind, he chose of all the choice [men] of Israel, and put [them] inarray against the Syrians: 

{10:10} And the rest of the people hedelivered into the hand of Abishai his brother, that he might put[them] in array against the children of Ammon. 

{10:11} And he said, Ifthe Syrians be too strong for me, then thou shalt help me: but if thechildren of Ammon be too strong for thee, then I will come and helpthee. 

{10:12} Be of good courage, and let us play the men for ourpeople, and for the cities of our God: and the LORD do that whichseemeth him good. 

{10:13} And Joab drew nigh, and the people that[were] with him, unto the battle against the Syrians: and they fledbefore him. 

{10:14} And when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrianswere fled, then fled they also before Abishai, and entered into thecity. So Joab returned from the children of Ammon, and came toJerusalem.   

{10:15} And when the Syrians saw that they were smitten beforeIsrael, they gathered themselves together. 

{10:16} And Hadarezer sent,and brought out the Syrians that [were] beyond the river: and they cameto Helam; and Shobach the captain of the host of Hadarezer [went]before them. 

{10:17} And when it was told David, he gathered all Israeltogether, and passed over Jordan, and came to Helam. And the Syriansset themselves in array against David, and fought with him. 

{10:18} Andthe Syrians fled before Israel; and David slew [the men of] sevenhundred chariots of the Syrians, and forty thousand horsemen, and smoteShobach the captain of their host, who died there. 

{10:19} And when allthe kings [that were] servants to Hadarezer saw that they were smittenbefore Israel, they made peace with Israel, and served them. So theSyrians feared to help the children of Ammon any more.   

{11:1} And it came to pass, after the year was expired, at the timewhen kings go forth [to battle,] that David sent Joab, and his servantswith him, and all Israel; and they destroyed the children of Ammon, andbesieged Rabbah. But David tarried still at Jerusalem.   

{11:2} And it came to pass in an eveningtide, that David arose fromoff his bed, and walked upon the roof of the king's house: and from theroof he saw a woman washing herself; and the woman [was] very beautifulto look upon. 

{11:3} And David sent and enquired after the woman. And[one] said, [Is] not this Bath-sheba, the daughter of Eliam, the wifeof Uriah the Hittite? 

{11:4} And David sent messengers, and took her;and she came in unto him, and he lay with her; for she was purifiedfrom her uncleanness: and she returned unto her house. 

{11:5} And thewoman conceived, and sent and told David, and said, I [am] with child.   

{11:6} And David sent to Joab, [saying,] Send me Uriah the Hittite.And Joab sent Uriah to David. 

{11:7} And when Uriah was come unto him,David demanded [of him] how Joab did, and how the people did, and howthe war prospered. 

{11:8} And David said to Uriah, Go down to thyhouse, and wash thy feet. And Uriah departed out of the king's house,and there followed him a mess [of meat] from the king. 

{11:9} But Uriahslept at the door of the king's house with all the servants of hislord, and went not down to his house. 

{11:10} And when they had toldDavid, saying, Uriah went not down unto his house, David said untoUriah, Camest thou not from [thy] journey? why [then] didst thou not godown unto thine house? 

{11:11} And Uriah said unto David, The ark, andIsrael, and Judah, abide in tents; and my lord Joab, and the servantsof my lord, are encamped in the open fields; shall I then go into minehouse, to eat and to drink, and to lie with my wife? [as] thou livest,and [as] thy soul liveth, I will not do this thing. 

{11:12} And Davidsaid to Uriah, Tarry here to day also, and to morrow I will let theedepart. So Uriah abode in Jerusalem that day, and the morrow. 

{11:13}And when David had called him, he did eat and drink before him; and hemade him drunk: and at even he went out to lie on his bed with theservants of his lord, but went not down to his house.   

{11:14} And it came to pass in the morning, that David wrote aletter to Joab, and sent [it] by the hand of Uriah. 

{11:15} And hewrote in the letter, saying, Set ye Uriah in the forefront of thehottest battle, and retire ye from him, that he may be smitten, anddie. 

{11:16} And it came to pass, when Joab observed the city, that heassigned Uriah unto a place where he knew that valiant men [were.]

{11:17} And the men of the city went out, and fought with Joab: andthere fell [some] of the people of the servants of David; and Uriah theHittite died also.   

{11:18} Then Joab sent and told David all the things concerning thewar; 

{11:19} And charged the messenger, saying, When thou hast made anend of telling the matters of the war unto the king, 

{11:20} And if sobe that the king's wrath arise, and he say unto thee, Whereforeapproached ye so nigh unto the city when ye did fight? knew ye not thatthey would shoot from the wall? 

{11:21} Who smote Abimelech the son ofJerubbesheth? did not a woman cast a piece of a millstone upon him fromthe wall, that he died in Thebez? why went ye nigh the wall? then saythou, Thy servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.   

{11:22} So the messenger went, and came and shewed David all thatJoab had sent him for. 

{11:23} And the messenger said unto David,Surely the men prevailed against us, and came out unto us into thefield, and we were upon them even unto the entering of the gate.

{11:24} And the shooters shot from off the wall upon thy servants; and[some] of the king's servants be dead, and thy servant Uriah theHittite is dead also. 

{11:25} Then David said unto the messenger, Thusshalt thou say unto Joab, Let not this thing displease thee, for thesword devoureth one as well as another: make thy battle more strongagainst the city, and overthrow it: and encourage thou him.   

{11:26} And when the wife of Uriah heard that Uriah her husband wasdead, she mourned for her husband. 

{11:27} And when the mourning waspast, David sent and fetched her to his house, and she became his wife,and bare him a son. But the thing that David had done displeased theLORD.   

{12:1} And the LORD sent Nathan unto David. And he came unto him,and said unto him, There were two men in one city; the one rich, andthe other poor. 

{12:2} The rich [man] had exceeding many flocks andherds: 

{12:3} But the poor [man] had nothing, save one little ewe lamb,which he had bought and nourished up: and it grew up together with him,and with his children; it did eat of his own meat, and drank of his owncup, and lay in his bosom, and was unto him as a daughter. 

{12:4} Andthere came a traveller unto the rich man, and he spared to take of hisown flock and of his own herd, to dress for the wayfaring man that wascome unto him; but took the poor man's lamb, and dressed it for the manthat was come to him. 

{12:5} And David's anger was greatly kindledagainst the man; and he said to Nathan, As the LORD liveth, the manthat hath done this [thing] shall surely die: 

{12:6} And he shallrestore the lamb fourfold, because he did this thing, and because hehad no pity.   

{12:7} And Nathan said to David, Thou [art] the man. Thus saith theLORD God of Israel, I anointed thee king over Israel, and I deliveredthee out of the hand of Saul; 

{12:8} And I gave thee thy master'shouse, and thy master's wives into thy bosom, and gave thee the houseof Israel and of Judah; and if [that had been] too little, I wouldmoreover have given unto thee such and such things. 

{12:9} Whereforehast thou despised the commandment of the LORD, to do evil in hissight? thou hast killed Uriah the Hittite with the sword, and hasttaken his wife [to be] thy wife, and hast slain him with the sword ofthe children of Ammon. 

{12:10} Now therefore the sword shall neverdepart from thine house; because thou hast despised me, and hast takenthe wife of Uriah the Hittite to be thy wife. 

{12:11} Thus saith theLORD, Behold, I will raise up evil against thee out of thine own house,and I will take thy wives before thine eyes, and give [them] unto thyneighbour, and he shall lie with thy wives in the sight of this sun.

{12:12} For thou didst [it] secretly: but I will do this thing beforeall Israel, and before the sun. 

{12:13} And David said unto Nathan, Ihave sinned against the LORD. And Nathan said unto David, The LORD alsohath put away thy sin; thou shalt not die. 

{12:14} Howbeit, because bythis deed thou hast given great occasion to the enemies of the LORD toblaspheme, the child also [that is] born unto thee shall surely die.   

{12:15} And Nathan departed unto his house. And the LORD struck thechild that Uriah's wife bare unto David, and it was very sick. 

{12:16}David therefore besought God for the child; and David fasted, and wentin, and lay all night upon the earth. 

{12:17} And the elders of hishouse arose, [and went] to him, to raise him up from the earth: but hewould not, neither did he eat bread with them. 

{12:18} And it came topass on the seventh day, that the child died. And the servants of Davidfeared to tell him that the child was dead: for they said, Behold,while the child was yet alive, we spake unto him, and he would nothearken unto our voice: how will he then vex himself, if we tell himthat the child is dead? 

{12:19} But when David saw that his servantswhispered, David perceived that the child was dead: therefore Davidsaid unto his servants, Is the child dead? And they said, He is dead.

{12:20} Then David arose from the earth, and washed, and anointed[himself,] and changed his apparel, and came into the house of theLORD, and worshipped: then he came to his own house; and when herequired, they set bread before him, and he did eat. 

{12:21} Then saidhis servants unto him, What thing [is] this that thou hast done? thoudidst fast and weep for the child, [while it was] alive; but when thechild was dead, thou didst rise and eat bread. 

{12:22} And he said,While the child was yet alive, I fasted and wept: for I said, Who cantell [whether] GOD will be gracious to me, that the child may live?

{12:23} But now he is dead, wherefore should I fast? can I bring himback again? I shall go to him, but he shall not return to me.   

{12:24} And David comforted Bath-sheba his wife, and went in untoher, and lay with her: and she bare a son, and he called his nameSolomon: and the LORD loved him. 

{12:25} And he sent by the hand ofNathan the prophet; and he called his name Jedidiah, because of theLORD.   

{12:26} And Joab fought against Rabbah of the children of Ammon, andtook the royal city. 

{12:27} And Joab sent messengers to David, andsaid, I have fought against Rabbah, and have taken the city of waters.

{12:28} Now therefore gather the rest of the people together, andencamp against the city, and take it: lest I take the city, and it becalled after my name. 

{12:29} And David gathered all the peopletogether, and went to Rabbah, and fought against it, and took it.

{12:30} And he took their king's crown from off his head, the weightwhereof [was] a talent of gold with the precious stones: and it was[set] on David's head. And he brought forth the spoil of the city ingreat abundance. 

{12:31} And he brought forth the people that [were]therein, and put [them] under saws, and under harrows of iron, andunder axes of iron, and made them pass through the brickkiln: and thusdid he unto all the cities of the children of Ammon. So David and allthe people returned unto Jerusalem.   

{13:1} And it came to pass after this, that Absalom the son of Davidhad a fair sister, whose name [was] Tamar; and Amnon the son of Davidloved her. 

{13:2} And Amnon was so vexed, that he fell sick for hissister Tamar; for she [was] a virgin; and Amnon thought it hard for himto do any thing to her. 

{13:3} But Amnon had a friend, whose name [was]Jonadab, the son of Shimeah David's brother: and Jonadab [was] a verysubtil man. 

{13:4} And he said unto him, Why [art] thou, [being] theking's son, lean from day to day? wilt thou not tell me? And Amnon saidunto him, I love Tamar, my brother Absalom's sister. 

{13:5} And Jonadabsaid unto him, Lay thee down on thy bed, and make thyself sick: andwhen thy father cometh to see thee, say unto him, I pray thee, let mysister Tamar come, and give me meat, and dress the meat in my sight,that I may see [it,] and eat [it] at her hand.   

{13:6} So Amnon lay down, and made himself sick: and when the kingwas come to see him, Amnon said unto the king, I pray thee, let Tamarmy sister come, and make me a couple of cakes in my sight, that I mayeat at her hand. 

{13:7} Then David sent home to Tamar, saying, Go nowto thy brother Amnon's house, and dress him meat. 

{13:8} So Tamar wentto her brother Amnon's house; and he was laid down. And she took flour,and kneaded [it,] and made cakes in his sight, and did bake the cakes.

{13:9} And she took a pan, and poured [them] out before him; but herefused to eat. And Amnon said, Have out all men from me. And they wentout every man from him. 

{13:10} And Amnon said unto Tamar, Bring themeat into the chamber, that I may eat of thine hand. And Tamar took thecakes which she had made, and brought [them] into the chamber to Amnonher brother. 

{13:11} And when she had brought [them] unto him to eat,he took hold of her, and said unto her, Come lie with me, my sister.

{13:12} And she answered him, Nay, my brother, do not force me; for nosuch thing ought to be done in Israel: do not thou this folly. 

{13:13}And I, whither shall I cause my shame to go? and as for thee, thoushalt be as one of the fools in Israel. Now therefore, I pray thee,speak unto the king; for he will not withhold me from thee. 

{13:14}Howbeit he would not hearken unto her voice: but, being stronger thanshe, forced her, and lay with her.   

{13:15} Then Amnon hated her exceedingly; so that the hatredwherewith he hated her [was] greater than the love wherewith he hadloved her. And Amnon said unto her, Arise, be gone. 

{13:16} And shesaid unto him, [There is] no cause: this evil in sending me away [is]greater than the other that thou didst unto me. But he would nothearken unto her. 

{13:17} Then he called his servant that ministeredunto him, and said, Put now this [woman] out from me, and bolt the doorafter her. 

{13:18} And [she had] a garment of divers colours upon her:for with such robes were the king's daughters [that were] virginsapparelled. Then his servant brought her out, and bolted the door afterher.   

{13:19} And Tamar put ashes on her head, and rent her garment ofdivers colours that [was] on her, and laid her hand on her head, andwent on crying. 

{13:20} And Absalom her brother said unto her, HathAmnon thy brother been with thee? but hold now thy peace, my sister: he[is] thy brother; regard not this thing. So Tamar remained desolate inher brother Absalom's house.   

{13:21} But when king David heard of all these things, he was verywroth. 

{13:22} And Absalom spake unto his brother Amnon neither goodnor bad: for Absalom hated Amnon, because he had forced his sisterTamar.   

{13:23} And it came to pass after two full years, that Absalom hadsheepshearers in Baal- hazor, which [is] beside Ephraim: and Absalominvited all the king's sons. 

{13:24} And Absalom came to the king, andsaid, Behold now, thy servant hath sheepshearers; let the king, Ibeseech thee, and his servants go with thy servant. 

{13:25} And theking said to Absalom, Nay, my son, let us not all now go, lest we bechargeable unto thee. And he pressed him: howbeit he would not go, butblessed him. 

{13:26} Then said Absalom, If not, I pray thee, let mybrother Amnon go with us. And the king said unto him, Why should he gowith thee? 

{13:27} But Absalom pressed him, that he let Amnon and allthe king's sons go with him.   

{13:28} Now Absalom had commanded his servants, saying, Mark ye nowwhen Amnon's heart is merry with wine, and when I say unto you, SmiteAmnon; then kill him, fear not: have not I commanded you? be courageousand be valiant. 

{13:29} And the servants of Absalom did unto Amnon asAbsalom had commanded. Then all the king's sons arose, and every mangat him up upon his mule, and fled.   

{13:30} And it came to pass, while they were in the way, thattidings came to David, saying, Absalom hath slain all the king's sons,and there is not one of them left. 

{13:31} Then the king arose, andtare his garments, and lay on the earth; and all his servants stood bywith their clothes rent. 

{13:32} And Jonadab, the son of ShimeahDavid's brother, answered and said, Let not my lord suppose [that] theyhave slain all the young men the king's sons; for Amnon only is dead:for by the appointment of Absalom this hath been determined from theday that he forced his sister Tamar. 

{13:33} Now therefore let not mylord the king take the thing to his heart, to think that all the king'ssons are dead: for Amnon only is dead. 

{13:34} But Absalom fled. Andthe young man that kept the watch lifted up his eyes, and looked, and,behold, there came much people by the way of the hill side behind him.

{13:35} And Jonadab said unto the king, Behold, the king's sons come:as thy servant said, so it is. 

{13:36} And it came to pass, as soon ashe had made an end of speaking, that, behold, the king's sons came, andlifted up their voice and wept: and the king also and all his servantswept very sore.   

{13:37} But Absalom fled, and went to Talmai, the son of Ammihud,king of Geshur. And [David] mourned for his son every day. 

{13:38} SoAbsalom fled, and went to Geshur, and was there three years. 

{13:39}And [the soul of] king David longed to go forth unto Absalom: for hewas comforted concerning Amnon, seeing he was dead.   

{14:1} Now Joab the son of Zeruiah perceived that the king's heart[was] toward Absalom. 

{14:2} And Joab sent to Tekoah, and fetchedthence a wise woman, and said unto her, I pray thee, feign thyself tobe a mourner, and put on now mourning apparel, and anoint not thyselfwith oil, but be as a woman that had a long time mourned for the dead:

{14:3} And come to the king, and speak on this manner unto him. So Joabput the words in her mouth.   

{14:4} And when the woman of Tekoah spake to the king, she fell onher face to the ground, and did obeisance, and said, Help, O king.

{14:5} And the king said unto her, What aileth thee? And she answered,I [am] indeed a widow woman, and mine husband is dead. 

{14:6} And thyhandmaid had two sons, and they two strove together in the field, and[there was] none to part them, but the one smote the other, and slewhim. 

{14:7} And, behold, the whole family is risen against thinehandmaid, and they said, Deliver him that smote his brother, that wemay kill him, for the life of his brother whom he slew; and we willdestroy the heir also: and so they shall quench my coal which is left,and shall not leave to my husband [neither] name nor remainder upon theearth. 

{14:8} And the king said unto the woman, Go to thine house, andI will give charge concerning thee. 

{14:9} And the woman of Tekoah saidunto the king, My lord, O king, the iniquity [be] on me, and on myfather's house: and the king and his throne [be] guiltless. 

{14:10} Andthe king said, Whosoever saith [ought] unto thee, bring him to me, andhe shall not touch thee any more. 

{14:11} Then said she, I pray thee,let the king remember the LORD thy God, that thou wouldest not sufferthe revengers of blood to destroy any more, lest they destroy my son.And he said, As the LORD liveth, there shall not one hair of thy sonfall to the earth. 

{14:12} Then the woman said, Let thine handmaid, Ipray thee, speak [one] word unto my lord the king. And he said, Say on.

{14:13} And the woman said, Wherefore then hast thou thought such athing against the people of God? for the king doth speak this thing asone which is faulty, in that the king doth not fetch home again hisbanished. 

{14:14} For we must needs die, and [are] as water spilt onthe ground, which cannot be gathered up again; neither doth God respect[any] person: yet doth he devise means, that his banished be notexpelled from him. 

{14:15} Now therefore that I am come to speak ofthis thing unto my lord the king, [it is] because the people have mademe afraid: and thy handmaid said, I will now speak unto the king; itmay be that the king will perform the request of his handmaid. 

{14:16}For the king will hear, to deliver his handmaid out of the hand of theman [that would] destroy me and my son together out of the inheritanceof God. 

{14:17} Then thine handmaid said, The word of my lord the kingshall now be comfortable: for as an angel of God, so [is] my lord theking to discern good and bad: therefore the LORD thy God will be withthee. 

{14:18} Then the king answered and said unto the woman, Hide notfrom me, I pray thee, the thing that I shall ask thee. And the womansaid, Let my lord the king now speak. 

{14:19} And the king said, [Isnot] the hand of Joab with thee in all this? And the woman answered andsaid, [As] thy soul liveth, my lord the king, none can turn to theright hand or to the left from ought that my lord the king hath spoken:for thy servant Joab, he bade me, and he put all these words in themouth of thine handmaid: 

{14:20} To fetch about this form of speechhath thy servant Joab done this thing: and my lord [is] wise, accordingto the wisdom of an angel of God, to know all [things] that [are] inthe earth.   

{14:21} And the king said unto Joab, Behold now, I have done thisthing: go therefore, bring the young man Absalom again. 

{14:22} AndJoab fell to the ground on his face, and bowed himself, and thanked theking: and Joab said, Today thy servant knoweth that I have found gracein thy sight, my lord, O king, in that the king hath fulfilled therequest of his servant. 

{14:23} So Joab arose and went to Geshur, andbrought Absalom to Jerusalem. 

{14:24} And the king said, Let him turnto his own house, and let him not see my face. So Absalom returned tohis own house, and saw not the king's face.   

{14:25} But in all Israel there was none to be so much praised asAbsalom for his beauty: from the sole of his foot even to the crown ofhis head there was no blemish in him. 

{14:26} And when he polled hishead, (for it was at every year's end that he polled [it:] because [thehair] was heavy on him, therefore he polled it:) he weighed the hair ofhis head at two hundred shekels after the king's weight. 

{14:27} Andunto Absalom there were born three sons, and one daughter, whose name[was] Tamar: she was a woman of a fair countenance.   

{14:28} So Absalom dwelt two full years in Jerusalem, and saw notthe king's face. 

{14:29} Therefore Absalom sent for Joab, to have senthim to the king; but he would not come to him: and when he sent againthe second time, he would not come. 

{14:30} Therefore he said unto hisservants, See, Joab's field is near mine, and he hath barley there; goand set it on fire. And Absalom's servants set the field on fire.

{14:31} Then Joab arose, and came to Absalom unto [his] house, and saidunto him, Wherefore have thy servants set my field on fire? 

{14:32} AndAbsalom answered Joab, Behold, I sent unto thee, saying, Come hither,that I may send thee to the king, to say, Wherefore am I come fromGeshur? [it had been] good for me [to have been] there still: nowtherefore let me see the king's face; and if there be [any] iniquity inme, let him kill me. 

{14:33} So Joab came to the king, and told him:and when he had called for Absalom, he came to the king, and bowedhimself on his face to the ground before the king: and the king kissedAbsalom.   

{15:1} And it came to pass after this, that Absalom prepared himchariots and horses, and fifty men to run before him. 

{15:2} AndAbsalom rose up early, and stood beside the way of the gate: and it wasso, that when any man that had a controversy came to the king forjudgment, then Absalom called unto him, and said, Of what city [art]thou? And he said, Thy servant is of one of the tribes of Israel.

{15:3} And Absalom said unto him, See, thy matters [are] good andright; but [there is] no man [deputed] of the king to hear thee. 

{15:4}Absalom said moreover, Oh that I were made judge in the land, thatevery man which hath any suit or cause might come unto me, and I woulddo him justice! 

{15:5} And it was [so,] that when any man came nigh [tohim] to do him obeisance, he put forth his hand, and took him, andkissed him. 

{15:6} And on this manner did Absalom to all Israel thatcame to the king for judgment: so Absalom stole the hearts of the menof Israel.   

{15:7} And it came to pass after forty years, that Absalom said untothe king, I pray thee, let me go and pay my vow, which I have vowedunto the LORD, in Hebron. 

{15:8} For thy servant vowed a vow while Iabode at Geshur in Syria, saying, If the LORD shall bring me againindeed to Jerusalem, then I will serve the LORD. 

{15:9} And the kingsaid unto him, Go in peace. So he arose, and went to Hebron.   

{15:10} But Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel,saying, As soon as ye hear the sound of the trumpet, then ye shall say,Absalom reigneth in Hebron. 

{15:11} And with Absalom went two hundredmen out of Jerusalem, [that were] called; and they went in theirsimplicity, and they knew not any thing. 

{15:12} And Absalom sent forAhithophel the Gilonite, David's counsellor, from his city, [even] fromGiloh, while he offered sacrifices. And the conspiracy was strong; forthe people increased continually with Absalom.   

{15:13} And there came a messenger to David, saying, The hearts ofthe men of Israel are after Absalom. 

{15:14} And David said unto allhis servants that [were] with him at Jerusalem, Arise, and let us flee;for we shall not [else] escape from Absalom: make speed to depart, lesthe overtake us suddenly, and bring evil upon us, and smite the citywith the edge of the sword. 

{15:15} And the king's servants said untothe king, Behold, thy servants [are ready to do] whatsoever my lord theking shall appoint. 

{15:16} And the king went forth, and all hishousehold after him. And the king left ten women, [which were]concubines, to keep the house. 

{15:17} And the king went forth, and allthe people after him, and tarried in a place that was far off. 

{15:18}And all his servants passed on beside him; and all the Cherethites, andall the Pelethites, and all the Gittites, six hundred men which cameafter him from Gath, passed on before the king.   

{15:19} Then said the king to Ittai the Gittite, Wherefore goestthou also with us? return to thy place, and abide with the king: forthou [art] a stranger, and also an exile. 

{15:20} Whereas thou camest[but] yesterday, should I this day make thee go up and down with us?seeing I go whither I may, return thou, and take back thy brethren:mercy and truth [be] with thee. 

{15:21} And Ittai answered the king,and said, [As] the LORD liveth, and [as] my lord the king liveth,surely in what place my lord the king shall be, whether in death orlife, even there also will thy servant be. 

{15:22} And David said toIttai, Go and pass over. And Ittai the Gittite passed over, and all hismen, and all the little ones that [were] with him. 

{15:23} And all thecountry wept with a loud voice, and all the people passed over: theking also himself passed over the brook Kidron, and all the peoplepassed over, toward the way of the wilderness.   

{15:24} And lo Zadok also, and all the Levites [were] with him,bearing the ark of the covenant of God: and they set down the ark ofGod; and Abiathar went up, until all the people had done passing out ofthe city. 

{15:25} And the king said unto Zadok, Carry back the ark ofGod into the city: if I shall find favour in the eyes of the LORD, hewill bring me again, and shew me [both] it, and his habitation: 

{15:26}But if he thus say, I have no delight in thee; behold, [here am] I, lethim do to me as seemeth good unto him. 

{15:27} The king said also untoZadok the priest, [Art not] thou a seer? return into the city in peace,and your two sons with you, Ahimaaz thy son, and Jonathan the son ofAbiathar. 

{15:28} See, I will tarry in the plain of the wilderness,until there come word from you to certify me. 

{15:29} Zadok thereforeand Abiathar carried the ark of God again to Jerusalem: and theytarried there.   

{15:30} And David went up by the ascent of [mount] Olivet, and weptas he went up, and had his head covered, and he went barefoot: and allthe people that [was] with him covered every man his head, and theywent up, weeping as they went up.   

{15:31} And [one] told David, saying, Ahithophel [is] among theconspirators with Absalom. And David said, O LORD, I pray thee, turnthe counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness.   

{15:32} And it came to pass, that [when] David was come to the top[of the mount,] where he worshipped God, behold, Hushai the Architecame to meet him with his coat rent, and earth upon his head: 

{15:33}Unto whom David said, If thou passest on with me, then thou shalt be aburden unto me: 

{15:34} But if thou return to the city, and say untoAbsalom, I will be thy servant, O king; [as] I [have been] thy father'sservant hitherto, so [will] I now also [be] thy servant: then mayestthou for me defeat the counsel of Ahithophel. 

{15:35} And [hast thou]not there with thee Zadok and Abiathar the priests? therefore it shallbe, [that] what thing soever thou shalt hear out of the king's house,thou shalt tell [it] to Zadok and Abiathar the priests. 

{15:36} Behold,[they have] there with them their two sons, Ahimaaz Zadok's [son,] andJonathan Abiathar's [son;] and by them ye shall send unto me everything that ye can hear. 

{15:37} So Hushai David's friend came into thecity, and Absalom came into Jerusalem.   

{16:1} And when David was a little past the top [of the hill,]behold, Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth met him, with a couple ofasses saddled, and upon them two hundred [loaves] of bread, and anhundred bunches of raisins, and an hundred of summer fruits, and abottle of wine. 

{16:2} And the king said unto Ziba, What meanest thouby these? And Ziba said, The asses [be] for the king's household toride on; and the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat; andthe wine, that such as be faint in the wilderness may drink. 

{16:3} Andthe king said, And where [is] thy master's son? And Ziba said unto theking, Behold, he abideth at Jerusalem: for he said, Today shall thehouse of Israel restore me the kingdom of my father. 

{16:4} Then saidthe king to Ziba, Behold, thine [are] all that [pertained] untoMephibosheth. And Ziba said, I humbly beseech thee [that] I may findgrace in thy sight, my lord, O king.   

{16:5} And when king David came to Bahurim, behold, thence came outa man of the family of the house of Saul, whose name [was] Shimei, theson of Gera: he came forth, and cursed still as he came. 

{16:6} And hecast stones at David, and at all the servants of king David: and allthe people and all the mighty men [were] on his right hand and on hisleft. 

{16:7} And thus said Shimei when he cursed, Come out, come out,thou bloody man, and thou man of Belial: 

{16:8} The LORD hath returnedupon thee all the blood of the house of Saul, in whose stead thou hastreigned; and the LORD hath delivered the kingdom into the hand ofAbsalom thy son: and, behold, thou [art taken] in thy mischief, becausethou [art] a bloody man.   

{16:9} Then said Abishai the son of Zeruiah unto the king, Whyshould this dead dog curse my lord the king? let me go over, I praythee, and take off his head. 

{16:10} And the king said, What have I todo with you, ye sons of Zeruiah? so let him curse, because the LORDhath said unto him, Curse David. Who shall then say, Wherefore hastthou done so? 

{16:11} And David said to Abishai, and to all hisservants, Behold, my son, which came forth of my bowels, seeketh mylife: how much more now [may this] Benjamite [do it?] let him alone,and let him curse; for the LORD hath bidden him. 

{16:12} It may be thatthe LORD will look on mine affliction, and that the LORD will requiteme good for his cursing this day. 

{16:13} And as David and his men wentby the way, Shimei went along on the hill's side over against him, andcursed as he went, and threw stones at him, and cast dust. 

{16:14} Andthe king, and all the people that [were] with him, came weary, andrefreshed themselves there.   

{16:15} And Absalom, and all the people the men of Israel, came toJerusalem, and Ahithophel with him. 

{16:16} And it came to pass, whenHushai the Archite, David's friend, was come unto Absalom, that Hushaisaid unto Absalom, God save the king, God save the king. 

{16:17} AndAbsalom said to Hushai, [Is] this thy kindness to thy friend? whywentest thou not with thy friend? 

{16:18} And Hushai said unto Absalom,Nay; but whom the LORD, and this people, and all the men of Israel,choose, his will I be, and with him will I abide. 

{16:19} And again,whom should I serve? [should I] not [serve] in the presence of his son?as I have served in thy father's presence, so will I be in thy presence.   

{16:20} Then said Absalom to Ahithophel, Give counsel among you whatwe shall do. 

{16:21} And Ahithophel said unto Absalom, Go in unto thyfather's concubines, which he hath left to keep the house; and allIsrael shall hear that thou art abhorred of thy father: then shall thehands of all that [are] with thee be strong. 

{16:22} So they spreadAbsalom a tent upon the top of the house; and Absalom went in unto hisfather's concubines in the sight of all Israel. 

{16:23} And the counselof Ahithophel, which he counselled in those days, [was] as if a man hadenquired at the oracle of God: so [was] all the counsel of Ahithophelboth with David and with Absalom.   

{17:1} Moreover Ahithophel said unto Absalom, Let me now choose outtwelve thousand men, and I will arise and pursue after David thisnight: 

{17:2} And I will come upon him while he [is] weary and weakhanded, and will make him afraid: and all the people that [are] withhim shall flee; and I will smite the king only: 

{17:3} And I will bringback all the people unto thee: the man whom thou seekest [is] as if allreturned: [so] all the people shall be in peace. 

{17:4} And the sayingpleased Absalom well, and all the elders of Israel. 

{17:5} Then saidAbsalom, Call now Hushai the Archite also, and let us hear likewisewhat he saith. 

{17:6} And when Hushai was come to Absalom, Absalomspake unto him, saying, Ahithophel hath spoken after this manner: shallwe do [after] his saying? if not; speak thou. 

{17:7} And Hushai saidunto Absalom, The counsel that Ahithophel hath given [is] not good atthis time. 

{17:8} For, said Hushai, thou knowest thy father and hismen, that they [be] mighty men, and they [be] chafed in their minds, asa bear robbed of her whelps in the field: and thy father [is] a man ofwar, and will not lodge with the people. 

{17:9} Behold, he is hid nowin some pit, or in some [other] place: and it will come to pass, whensome of them be overthrown at the first, that whosoever heareth it willsay, There is a slaughter among the people that follow Absalom. 

{17:10}And he also [that is] valiant, whose heart [is] as the heart of a lion,shall utterly melt: for all Israel knoweth that thy father [is] amighty man, and [they] which [be] with him [are] valiant men. 

{17:11}Therefore I counsel that all Israel be generally gathered unto thee,from Dan even to Beer-sheba, as the sand that [is] by the sea formultitude; and that thou go to battle in thine own person. 

{17:12} Soshall we come upon him in some place where he shall be found, and wewill light upon him as the dew falleth on the ground: and of him and ofall the men that [are] with him there shall not be left so much as one.

{17:13} Moreover, if he be gotten into a city, then shall all Israelbring ropes to that city, and we will draw it into the river, untilthere be not one small stone found there. 

{17:14} And Absalom and allthe men of Israel said, The counsel of Hushai the Archite [is] betterthan the counsel of Ahithophel. For the LORD had appointed to defeatthe good counsel of Ahithophel, to the intent that the LORD might bringevil upon Absalom.   

{17:15} Then said Hushai unto Zadok and to Abiathar the priests,Thus and thus did Ahithophel counsel Absalom and the elders of Israel;and thus and thus have I counselled. 

{17:16} Now therefore sendquickly, and tell David, saying, Lodge not this night in the plains ofthe wilderness, but speedily pass over; lest the king be swallowed up,and all the people that [are] with him. 

{17:17} Now Jonathan andAhimaaz stayed by En-rogel; for they might not be seen to come into thecity: and a wench went and told them; and they went and told kingDavid. 

{17:18} Nevertheless a lad saw them, and told Absalom: but theywent both of them away quickly, and came to a man's house in Bahurim,which had a well in his court; whither they went down. 

{17:19} And thewoman took and spread a covering over the well's mouth, and spreadground corn thereon; and the thing was not known. 

{17:20} And whenAbsalom's servants came to the woman to the house, they said, Where isAhimaaz and Jonathan? And the woman said unto them, They be gone overthe brook of water. And when they had sought and could not find [them,]they returned to Jerusalem. 

{17:21} And it came to pass, after theywere departed, that they came up out of the well, and went and toldking David, and said unto David, Arise, and pass quickly over thewater: for thus hath Ahithophel counselled against you. 

{17:22} ThenDavid arose, and all the people that [were] with him, and they passedover Jordan: by the morning light there lacked not one of them that wasnot gone over Jordan.   

{17:23} And when Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed,he saddled [his] ass, and arose, and gat him home to his house, to hiscity, and put his household in order, and hanged himself, and died, andwas buried in the sepulchre of his father. 

{17:24} Then David came toMahanaim. And Absalom passed over Jordan, he and all the men of Israelwith him.   

{17:25} And Absalom made Amasa captain of the host instead of Joab:which Amasa was a man's son, whose name [was] Ithra an Israelite, thatwent in to Abigail the daughter of Nahash, sister to Zeruiah Joab'smother. 

{17:26} So Israel and Absalom pitched in the land of Gilead.   

{17:27} And it came to pass, when David was come to Mahanaim, thatShobi the son of Nahash of Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and Machirthe son of Ammiel of Lo- debar, and Barzillai the Gileadite of Rogelim,

{17:28} Brought beds, and basons, and earthen vessels, and wheat, andbarley, and flour, and parched [corn,] and beans, and lentiles, andparched [pulse, ]

{17:29} And honey, and butter, and sheep, and cheeseof kine, for David, and for the people that [were] with him, to eat:for they said, The people [is] hungry, and weary, and thirsty, in thewilderness.   

{18:1} And David numbered the people that [were] with him, and setcaptains of thousands and captains of hundreds over them. 

{18:2} AndDavid sent forth a third part of the people under the hand of Joab, anda third part under the hand of Abishai the son of Zeruiah, Joab'sbrother, and a third part under the hand of Ittai the Gittite. And theking said unto the people, I will surely go forth with you myself also.

{18:3} But the people answered, Thou shalt not go forth: for if we fleeaway, they will not care for us; neither if half of us die, will theycare for us: but now [thou art] worth ten thousand of us: therefore now[it is] better that thou succour us out of the city. 

{18:4} And theking said unto them, What seemeth you best I will do. And the kingstood by the gate side, and all the people came out by hundreds and bythousands. 

{18:5} And the king commanded Joab and Abishai and Ittai,saying, [Deal] gently for my sake with the young man, [even] withAbsalom. And all the people heard when the king gave all the captainscharge concerning Absalom.   

{18:6} So the people went out into the field against Israel: and thebattle was in the wood of Ephraim; 

{18:7} Where the people of Israelwere slain before the servants of David, and there was there a greatslaughter that day of twenty thousand [men. ]

{18:8} For the battle wasthere scattered over the face of all the country: and the wood devouredmore people that day than the sword devoured.   

{18:9} And Absalom met the servants of David. And Absalom rode upona mule, and the mule went under the thick boughs of a great oak, andhis head caught hold of the oak, and he was taken up between the heavenand the earth; and the mule that [was] under him went away. 

{18:10} Anda certain man saw it, and told Joab, and said, Behold, I saw Absalomhanged in an oak. 

{18:11} And Joab said unto the man that told him,And, behold, thou sawest [him,] and why didst thou not smite him thereto the ground? and I would have given thee ten [shekels] of silver, anda girdle. 

{18:12} And the man said unto Joab, Though I should receive athousand [shekels] of silver in mine hand, yet would I not put forthmine hand against the king's son: for in our hearing the king chargedthee and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Beware that none [touch] the youngman Absalom. 

{18:13} Otherwise I should have wrought falsehood againstmine own life: for there is no matter hid from the king, and thouthyself wouldest have set thyself against [me. ]

{18:14} Then said Joab,I may not tarry thus with thee. And he took three darts in his hand,and thrust them through the heart of Absalom, while he [was] yet alivein the midst of the oak. 

{18:15} And ten young men that bare Joab'sarmour compassed about and smote Absalom, and slew him. 

{18:16} AndJoab blew the trumpet, and the people returned from pursuing afterIsrael: for Joab held back the people. 

{18:17} And they took Absalom,and cast him into a great pit in the wood, and laid a very great heapof stones upon him: and all Israel fled every one to his tent.   

{18:18} Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up forhimself a pillar, which [is] in the king's dale: for he said, I have noson to keep my name in remembrance: and he called the pillar after hisown name: and it is called unto this day, Absalom's place.   

{18:19} Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok, Let me now run, and bearthe king tidings, how that the LORD hath avenged him of his enemies.

{18:20} And Joab said unto him, Thou shalt not bear tidings this day,but thou shalt bear tidings another day: but this day thou shalt bearno tidings, because the king's son is dead. 

{18:21} Then said Joab toCushi, Go tell the king what thou hast seen. And Cushi bowed himselfunto Joab, and ran. 

{18:22} Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok yetagain to Joab, But howsoever, let me, I pray thee, also run afterCushi. And Joab said, Wherefore wilt thou run, my son, seeing that thouhast no tidings ready? 

{18:23} But howsoever, [said he,] let me run.And he said unto him, Run. Then Ahimaaz ran by the way of the plain,and overran Cushi. 

{18:24} And David sat between the two gates: and thewatchman went up to the roof over the gate unto the wall, and lifted uphis eyes, and looked, and behold a man running alone. 

{18:25} And thewatchman cried, and told the king. And the king said, If he [be] alone,[there is] tidings in his mouth. And he came apace, and drew near.

{18:26} And the watchman saw another man running: and the watchmancalled unto the porter, and said, Behold [another] man running alone.And the king said, He also bringeth tidings. 

{18:27} And the watchmansaid, Me thinketh the running of the foremost is like the running ofAhimaaz the son of Zadok. And the king said, He [is] a good man, andcometh with good tidings. 

{18:28} And Ahimaaz called, and said unto theking, All is well. And he fell down to the earth upon his face beforethe king, and said, Blessed [be] the LORD thy God, which hath deliveredup the men that lifted up their hand against my lord the king. 

{18:29}And the king said, Is the young man Absalom safe? And Ahimaaz answered,When Joab sent the king's servant, and [me] thy servant, I saw a greattumult, but I knew not what [it was. ]

{18:30} And the king said [untohim,] Turn aside, [and] stand here. And he turned aside, and stoodstill. 

{18:31} And, behold, Cushi came; and Cushi said, Tidings, mylord the king: for the LORD hath avenged thee this day of all them thatrose up against thee. 

{18:32} And the king said unto Cushi, Is theyoung man Absalom safe? And Cushi answered, The enemies of my lord theking, and all that rise against thee to do [thee] hurt, be as [that]young man [is.]   

{18:33} And the king was much moved, and went up to the chamber overthe gate, and wept: and as he went, thus he said, O my son Absalom, myson, my son Absalom! would God I had died for thee, O Absalom, my son,my son!   

{19:1} And it was told Joab, Behold, the king weepeth and mournethfor Absalom. 

{19:2} And the victory that day was [turned] into mourningunto all the people: for the people heard say that day how the king wasgrieved for his son. 

{19:3} And the people gat them by stealth that dayinto the city, as people being ashamed steal away when they flee inbattle. 

{19:4} But the king covered his face, and the king cried with aloud voice, O my son Absalom, O Absalom, my son, my son! 

{19:5} AndJoab came into the house to the king, and said, Thou hast shamed thisday the faces of all thy servants, which this day have saved thy life,and the lives of thy sons and of thy daughters, and the lives of thywives, and the lives of thy concubines; 

{19:6} In that thou lovestthine enemies, and hatest thy friends. For thou hast declared this day,that thou regardest neither princes nor servants: for this day Iperceive, that if Absalom had lived, and all we had died this day, thenit had pleased thee well. 

{19:7} Now therefore arise, go forth, andspeak comfortably unto thy servants: for I swear by the LORD, if thougo not forth, there will not tarry one with thee this night: and thatwill be worse unto thee than all the evil that befell thee from thyyouth until now. 

{19:8} Then the king arose, and sat in the gate. Andthey told unto all the people, saying, Behold, the king doth sit in thegate. And all the people came before the king: for Israel had fledevery man to his tent.   

{19:9} And all the people were at strife throughout all the tribesof Israel, saying, The king saved us out of the hand of our enemies,and he delivered us out of the hand of the Philistines; and now he isfled out of the land for Absalom. 

{19:10} And Absalom, whom we anointedover us, is dead in battle. Now therefore why speak ye not a word ofbringing the king back?   

{19:11} And king David sent to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests,saying, Speak unto the elders of Judah, saying, Why are ye the last tobring the king back to his house? seeing the speech of all Israel iscome to the king, [even] to his house. 

{19:12} Ye [are] my brethren, ye[are] my bones and my flesh: wherefore then are ye the last to bringback the king? 

{19:13} And say ye to Amasa, [Art] thou not of my bone,and of my flesh? God do so to me, and more also, if thou be not captainof the host before me continually in the room of Joab. 

{19:14} And hebowed the heart of all the men of Judah, even as [the heart of] oneman; so that they sent [this word] unto the king, Return thou, and allthy servants. 

{19:15} So the king returned, and came to Jordan. AndJudah came to Gilgal, to go to meet the king, to conduct the king overJordan.   

{19:16} And Shimei the son of Gera, a Benjamite, which [was] ofBahurim, hasted and came down with the men of Judah to meet king David.

{19:17} And [there were] a thousand men of Benjamin with him, and Zibathe servant of the house of Saul, and his fifteen sons and his twentyservants with him; and they went over Jordan before the king. 

{19:18}And there went over a ferry boat to carry over the king's household,and to do what he thought good. And Shimei the son of Gera fell downbefore the king, as he was come over Jordan; 

{19:19} And said unto theking, Let not my lord impute iniquity unto me, neither do thou rememberthat which thy servant did perversely the day that my lord the kingwent out of Jerusalem, that the king should take it to his heart.

{19:20} For thy servant doth know that I have sinned: therefore,behold, I am come the first this day of all the house of Joseph to godown to meet my lord the king. 

{19:21} But Abishai the son of Zeruiahanswered and said, Shall not Shimei be put to death for this, becausehe cursed the LORD'S anointed? 

{19:22} And David said, What have I todo with you, ye sons of Zeruiah, that ye should this day be adversariesunto me? shall there any man be put to death this day in Israel? for donot I know that I [am] this day king over Israel? 

{19:23} Therefore theking said unto Shimei, Thou shalt not die. And the king sware unto him.   

{19:24} And Mephibosheth the son of Saul came down to meet the king,and had neither dressed his feet, nor trimmed his beard, nor washed hisclothes, from the day the king departed until the day he came [again]in peace. 

{19:25} And it came to pass, when he was come to Jerusalem tomeet the king, that the king said unto him, Wherefore wentest not thouwith me, Mephibosheth? 

{19:26} And he answered, My lord, O king, myservant deceived me: for thy servant said, I will saddle me an ass,that I may ride thereon, and go to the king; because thy servant [is]lame. 

{19:27} And he hath slandered thy servant unto my lord the king;but my lord the king [is] as an angel of God: do therefore [what is]good in thine eyes. 

{19:28} For all [of] my father's house were butdead men before my lord the king: yet didst thou set thy servant amongthem that did eat at thine own table. What right therefore have I yetto cry any more unto the king? 

{19:29} And the king said unto him, Whyspeakest thou any more of thy matters? I have said, Thou and Zibadivide the land. 

{19:30} And Mephibosheth said unto the king, Yea, lethim take all, forasmuch as my lord the king is come again in peace untohis own house.   

{19:31} And Barzillai the Gileadite came down from Rogelim, and wentover Jordan with the king, to conduct him over Jordan. 

{19:32} NowBarzillai was a very aged man, [even] fourscore years old: and he hadprovided the king of sustenance while he lay at Mahanaim; for he [was]a very great man. 

{19:33} And the king said unto Barzillai, Come thouover with me, and I will feed thee with me in Jerusalem. 

{19:34} AndBarzillai said unto the king, How long have I to live, that I should goup with the king unto Jerusalem? 

{19:35} I [am] this day fourscoreyears old: [and] can I discern between good and evil? can thy servanttaste what I eat or what I drink? can I hear any more the voice ofsinging men and singing women? wherefore then should thy servant be yeta burden unto my lord the king? 

{19:36} Thy servant will go a littleway over Jordan with the king: and why should the king recompense it mewith such a reward? 

{19:37} Let thy servant, I pray thee, turn backagain, that I may die in mine own city, [and be buried] by the grave ofmy father and of my mother. But behold thy servant Chimham; let him goover with my lord the king; and do to him what shall seem good untothee. 

{19:38} And the king answered, Chimham shall go over with me, andI will do to him that which shall seem good unto thee: and whatsoeverthou shalt require of me, [that] will I do for thee. 

{19:39} And allthe people went over Jordan. And when the king was come over, the kingkissed Barzillai, and blessed him; and he returned unto his own place.

{19:40} Then the king went on to Gilgal, and Chimham went on with him:and all the people of Judah conducted the king, and also half thepeople of Israel.   

{19:41} And, behold, all the men of Israel came to the king, andsaid unto the king, Why have our brethren the men of Judah stolen theeaway, and have brought the king, and his household, and all David's menwith him, over Jordan? 

{19:42} And all the men of Judah answered themen of Israel, Because the king [is] near of kin to us: wherefore thenbe ye angry for this matter? have we eaten at all of the king's [cost?]or hath he given us any gift? 

{19:43} And the men of Israel answeredthe men of Judah, and said, We have ten parts in the king, and we havealso more [right] in David than ye: why then did ye despise us, thatour advice should not be first had in bringing back our king? And thewords of the men of Judah were fiercer than the words of the men ofIsrael.   

{20:1} And there happened to be there a man of Belial, whose name[was] Sheba, the son of Bichri, a Benjamite: and he blew a trumpet, andsaid, We have no part in David, neither have we inheritance in the sonof Jesse: every man to his tents, O Israel. 

{20:2} So every man ofIsrael went up from after David, [and] followed Sheba the son ofBichri: but the men of Judah clave unto their king, from Jordan even toJerusalem.   

{20:3} And David came to his house at Jerusalem; and the king tookthe ten women [his] concubines, whom he had left to keep the house, andput them in ward, and fed them, but went not in unto them. So they wereshut up unto the day of their death, living in widowhood.   

{20:4} Then said the king to Amasa, Assemble me the men of Judahwithin three days, and be thou here present. 

{20:5} So Amasa went toassemble [the men of] Judah: but he tarried longer than the set timewhich he had appointed him. 

{20:6} And David said to Abishai, Now shallSheba the son of Bichri do us more harm than [did] Absalom: take thouthy lord's servants, and pursue after him, lest he get him fencedcities, and escape us. 

{20:7} And there went out after him Joab's men,and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, and all the mighty men: andthey went out of Jerusalem, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri.

{20:8} When they [were] at the great stone which [is] in Gibeon, Amasawent before them. And Joab's garment that he had put on was girded untohim, and upon it a girdle [with] a sword fastened upon his loins in thesheath thereof; and as he went forth it fell out. 

{20:9} And Joab saidto Amasa, [Art] thou in health, my brother? And Joab took Amasa by thebeard with the right hand to kiss him. 

{20:10} But Amasa took no heedto the sword that [was] in Joab's hand: so he smote him therewith inthe fifth [rib,] and shed out his bowels to the ground, and struck himnot again; and he died. So Joab and Abishai his brother pursued afterSheba the son of Bichri. 

{20:11} And one of Joab's men stood by him,and said, He that favoureth Joab, and he that [is] for David, [let himgo] after Joab. 

{20:12} And Amasa wallowed in blood in the midst of thehighway. And when the man saw that all the people stood still, heremoved Amasa out of the highway into the field, and cast a cloth uponhim, when he saw that every one that came by him stood still. 

{20:13}When he was removed out of the highway, all the people went on afterJoab, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri.   

{20:14} And he went through all the tribes of Israel unto Abel, andto Beth-maachah, and all the Berites: and they were gathered together,and went also after him. 

{20:15} And they came and besieged him in Abelof Beth-maachah, and they cast up a bank against the city, and it stoodin the trench: and all the people that [were] with Joab battered thewall, to throw it down.   

{20:16} Then cried a wise woman out of the city, Hear, hear; say, Ipray you, unto Joab, Come near hither, that I may speak with thee.

{20:17} And when he was come near unto her, the woman said, [Art] thouJoab? And he answered, I [am he.] Then she said unto him, Hear thewords of thine handmaid. And he answered, I do hear. 

{20:18} Then shespake, saying, They were wont to speak in old time, saying, They shallsurely ask [counsel] at Abel: and so they ended [the matter. ]

{20:19} I[am one of them that are] peaceable [and] faithful in Israel: thouseekest to destroy a city and a mother in Israel: why wilt thou swallowup the inheritance of the LORD? 

{20:20} And Joab answered and said, Farbe it, far be it from me, that I should swallow up or destroy. 

{20:21}The matter [is] not so: but a man of mount Ephraim, Sheba the son ofBichri by name, hath lifted up his hand against the king, [even]against David: deliver him only, and I will depart from the city. Andthe woman said unto Joab, Behold, his head shall be thrown to thee overthe wall. 

{20:22} Then the woman went unto all the people in herwisdom. And they cut off the head of Sheba the son of Bichri, and cast[it] out to Joab. And he blew a trumpet, and they retired from thecity, every man to his tent. And Joab returned to Jerusalem unto theking.   

{20:23} Now Joab [was] over all the host of Israel: and Benaiah theson of Jehoiada [was] over the Cherethites and over the Pelethites:

{20:24} And Adoram [was] over the tribute: and Jehoshaphat the son ofAhilud [was] recorder: 

{20:25} And Sheva [was] scribe: and Zadok andAbiathar [were] the priests: 

{20:26} And Ira also the Jairite was achief ruler about David.   

{21:1} Then there was a famine in the days of David three years,year after year; and David enquired of the LORD. And the LORD answered,[It is] for Saul, and for [his] bloody house, because he slew theGibeonites. 

{21:2} And the king called the Gibeonites, and said untothem; (now the Gibeonites [were] not of the children of Israel, but ofthe remnant of the Amorites; and the children of Israel had sworn untothem: and Saul sought to slay them in his zeal to the children ofIsrael and Judah.) 

{21:3} Wherefore David said unto the Gibeonites,What shall I do for you? and wherewith shall I make the atonement, thatye may bless the inheritance of the LORD? 

{21:4} And the Gibeonitessaid unto him, We will have no silver nor gold of Saul, nor of hishouse; neither for us shalt thou kill any man in Israel. And he said,What ye shall say, [that] will I do for you. 

{21:5} And they answeredthe king, The man that consumed us, and that devised against us [that]we should be destroyed from remaining in any of the coasts of Israel,

{21:6} Let seven men of his sons be delivered unto us, and we will hangthem up unto the LORD in Gibeah of Saul, [whom] the LORD did choose.And the king said, I will give [them. ]

{21:7} But the king sparedMephibosheth, the son of Jonathan the son of Saul, because of theLORD'S oath that [was] between them, between David and Jonathan the sonof Saul. 

{21:8} But the king took the two sons of Rizpah the daughterof Aiah, whom she bare unto Saul, Armoni and Mephibosheth; and the fivesons of Michal the daughter of Saul, whom she brought up for Adriel theson of Barzillai the Meholathite: 

{21:9} And he delivered them into thehands of the Gibeonites, and they hanged them in the hill before theLORD: and they fell [all] seven together, and were put to death in thedays of harvest, in the first [days,] in the beginning of barleyharvest.   

{21:10} And Rizpah the daughter of Aiah took sackcloth, and spreadit for her upon the rock, from the beginning of harvest until waterdropped upon them out of heaven, and suffered neither the birds of theair to rest on them by day, nor the beasts of the field by night.

{21:11} And it was told David what Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, theconcubine of Saul, had done.   

{21:12} And David went and took the bones of Saul and the bones ofJonathan his son from the men of Jabesh-gilead, which had stolen themfrom the street of Beth-shan, where the Philistines had hanged them,when the Philistines had slain Saul in Gilboa: 

{21:13} And he broughtup from thence the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son; andthey gathered the bones of them that were hanged. 

{21:14} And the bonesof Saul and Jonathan his son buried they in the country of Benjamin inZelah, in the sepulchre of Kish his father: and they performed all thatthe king commanded. And after that God was intreated for the land.   

{21:15} Moreover the Philistines had yet war again with Israel; andDavid went down, and his servants with him, and fought against thePhilistines: and David waxed faint. 

{21:16} And Ishbi-benob, which[was] of the sons of the giant, the weight of whose spear [weighed]three hundred [shekels] of brass in weight, he being girded with a new[sword,] thought to have slain David. 

{21:17} But Abishai the son ofZeruiah succoured him, and smote the Philistine, and killed him. Thenthe men of David sware unto him, saying, Thou shalt go no more out withus to battle, that thou quench not the light of Israel. 

{21:18} And itcame to pass after this, that there was again a battle with thePhilistines at Gob: then Sibbechai the Hushathite slew Saph, which[was] of the sons of the giant. 

{21:19} And there was again a battle inGob with the Philistines, where Elhanan the son of Jaare-oregim, aBethlehemite, slew [the brother of] Goliath the Gittite, the staff ofwhose spear [was] like a weaver's beam. 

{21:20} And there was yet abattle in Gath, where was a man of [great] stature, that had on everyhand six fingers, and on every foot six toes, four and twenty innumber; and he also was born to the giant. 

{21:21} And when he defiedIsrael, Jonathan the son of Shimeah the brother of David slew him.

{21:22} These four were born to the giant in Gath, and fell by the handof David, and by the hand of his servants.   

{22:1} And David spake unto the LORD the words of this song in theday [that] the LORD had delivered him out of the hand of all hisenemies, and out of the hand of Saul: 

{22:2} And he said, The LORD [is]my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer; 

{22:3} The God of my rock;in him will I trust: [he is] my shield, and the horn of my salvation,my high tower, and my refuge, my saviour; thou savest me from violence.

{22:4} I will call on the LORD, [who is] worthy to be praised: so shallI be saved from mine enemies. 

{22:5} When the waves of death compassedme, the floods of ungodly men made me afraid; 

{22:6} The sorrows ofhell compassed me about; the snares of death prevented me; 

{22:7} In mydistress I called upon the LORD, and cried to my God: and he did hearmy voice out of his temple, and my cry [did enter] into his ears.

{22:8} Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations of heavenmoved and shook, because he was wroth. 

{22:9} There went up a smoke outof his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth devoured: coals were kindledby it. 

{22:10} He bowed the heavens also, and came down; and darkness[was] under his feet. 

{22:11} And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly:and he was seen upon the wings of the wind. 

{22:12} And he madedarkness pavilions round about him, dark waters, [and] thick clouds ofthe skies. 

{22:13} Through the brightness before him were coals of firekindled. 

{22:14} The LORD thundered from heaven, and the most Highuttered his voice. 

{22:15} And he sent out arrows, and scattered them;lightning, and discomfited them. 

{22:16} And the channels of the seaappeared, the foundations of the world were discovered, at the rebukingof the LORD, at the blast of the breath of his nostrils. 

{22:17} Hesent from above, he took me; he drew me out of many waters; 

{22:18} Hedelivered me from my strong enemy, [and] from them that hated me: forthey were too strong for me. 

{22:19} They prevented me in the day of mycalamity: but the LORD was my stay. 

{22:20} He brought me forth alsointo a large place: he delivered me, because he delighted in me.

{22:21} The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness: accordingto the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me. 

{22:22} For I havekept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly departed from my God.

{22:23} For all his judgments [were] before me: and [as for] hisstatutes, I did not depart from them. 

{22:24} I was also upright beforehim, and have kept myself from mine iniquity. 

{22:25} Therefore theLORD hath recompensed me according to my righteousness; according to mycleanness in his eye sight. 

{22:26} With the merciful thou wilt shewthyself merciful, [and] with the upright man thou wilt shew thyselfupright. 

{22:27} With the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure; and withthe froward thou wilt shew thyself unsavoury. 

{22:28} And the afflictedpeople thou wilt save: but thine eyes [are] upon the haughty, [that]thou mayest bring [them] down. 

{22:29} For thou [art] my lamp, O LORD:and the LORD will lighten my darkness. 

{22:30} For by thee I have runthrough a troop: by my God have I leaped over a wall. 

{22:31} [As for]God, his way [is] perfect; the word of the LORD [is] tried: he [is] abuckler to all them that trust in him. 

{22:32} For who [is] God, savethe LORD? and who [is] a rock, save our God? 

{22:33} God [is] mystrength [and] power: and he maketh my way perfect. 

{22:34} He makethmy feet like hinds [feet:] and setteth me upon my high places. 

{22:35}He teacheth my hands to war; so that a bow of steel is broken by minearms. 

{22:36} Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation: andthy gentleness hath made me great. 

{22:37} Thou hast enlarged my stepsunder me; so that my feet did not slip. 

{22:38} I have pursued mineenemies, and destroyed them; and turned not again until I had consumedthem. 

{22:39} And I have consumed them, and wounded them, that theycould not arise: yea, they are fallen under my feet. 

{22:40} For thouhast girded me with strength to battle: them that rose up against mehast thou subdued under me. 

{22:41} Thou hast also given me the necksof mine enemies, that I might destroy them that hate me. 

{22:42} Theylooked, but [there was] none to save; [even] unto the LORD, but heanswered them not. 

{22:43} Then did I beat them as small as the dust ofthe earth, I did stamp them as the mire of the street, [and] did spreadthem abroad. 

{22:44} Thou also hast delivered me from the strivings ofmy people, thou hast kept me [to be] head of the heathen: a people[which] I knew not shall serve me. 

{22:45} Strangers shall submitthemselves unto me: as soon as they hear, they shall be obedient untome. 

{22:46} Strangers shall fade away, and they shall be afraid out oftheir close places. 

{22:47} The LORD liveth; and blessed [be] my rock;and exalted be the God of the rock of my salvation. 

{22:48} It [is] Godthat avengeth me, and that bringeth down the people under me, 

{22:49}And that bringeth me forth from mine enemies: thou also hast lifted meup on high above them that rose up against me: thou hast delivered mefrom the violent man. 

{22:50} Therefore I will give thanks unto thee, OLORD, among the heathen, and I will sing praises unto thy name. 

{22:51}[He is] the tower of salvation for his king: and sheweth mercy to hisanointed, unto David, and to his seed for evermore.   

{23:1} Now these [be] the last words of David. David the son ofJesse said, and the man [who was] raised up on high, the anointed ofthe God of Jacob, and the sweet psalmist of Israel, said, 

{23:2} TheSpirit of the LORD spake by me, and his word [was] in my tongue. 

{23:3}The God of Israel said, the Rock of Israel spake to me, He that rulethover men [must be] just, ruling in the fear of God. 

{23:4} And [heshall be] as the light of the morning, [when] the sun riseth, [even] amorning without clouds; [as] the tender grass [springing] out of theearth by clear shining after rain. 

{23:5} Although my house [be] not sowith God; yet he hath made with me an everlasting covenant, ordered inall [things,] and sure: for [this is] all my salvation, and all [my]desire, although he make [it] not to grow.   

{23:6} But [the sons] of Belial [shall be] all of them as thornsthrust away, because they cannot be taken with hands: 

{23:7} But theman [that] shall touch them must be fenced with iron and the staff of aspear; and they shall be utterly burned with fire in the [same] place.   

{23:8} These [be] the names of the mighty men whom David had: TheTachmonite that sat in the seat, chief among the captains; the same[was] Adino the Eznite: [he lift up his spear] against eight hundred,whom he slew at one time. 

{23:9} And after him [was] Eleazar the son ofDodo the Ahohite, [one] of the three mighty men with David, when theydefied the Philistines [that] were there gathered together to battle,and the men of Israel were gone away: 

{23:10} He arose, and smote thePhilistines until his hand was weary, and his hand clave unto thesword: and the LORD wrought a great victory that day; and the peoplereturned after him only to spoil. 

{23:11} And after him [was] Shammahthe son of Agee the Hararite. And the Philistines were gatheredtogether into a troop, where was a piece of ground full of lentiles:and the people fled from the Philistines. 

{23:12} But he stood in themidst of the ground, and defended it, and slew the Philistines: and theLORD wrought a great victory. 

{23:13} And three of the thirty chiefwent down, and came to David in the harvest time unto the cave ofAdullam: and the troop of the Philistines pitched in the valley ofRephaim. 

{23:14} And David [was] then in an hold, and the garrison ofthe Philistines [was] then [in] Bethlehem. 

{23:15} And David longed,and said, Oh that one would give me drink of the water of the well ofBethlehem, which [is] by the gate! 

{23:16} And the three mighty menbrake through the host of the Philistines, and drew water out of thewell of Bethlehem, that [was] by the gate, and took [it,] and brought[it] to David: nevertheless he would not drink thereof, but poured itout unto the LORD. 

{23:17} And he said, Be it far from me, O LORD, thatI should do this: [is not this] the blood of the men that went injeopardy of their lives? therefore he would not drink it. These thingsdid these three mighty men. 

{23:18} And Abishai, the brother of Joab,the son of Zeruiah, was chief among three. And he lifted up his spearagainst three hundred, [and] slew [them,] and had the name among three.

{23:19} Was he not most honourable of three? therefore he was theircaptain: howbeit he attained not unto the [first] three. 

{23:20} AndBenaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man, of Kabzeel, whohad done many acts, he slew two lionlike men of Moab: he went down alsoand slew a lion in the midst of a pit in time of snow: 

{23:21} And heslew an Egyptian, a goodly man: and the Egyptian had a spear in hishand; but he went down to him with a staff, and plucked the spear outof the Egyptian's hand, and slew him with his own spear. 

{23:22} These[things] did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had the name among threemighty men. 

{23:23} He was more honourable than the thirty, but heattained not to the [first] three. And David set him over his guard.

{23:24} Asahel the brother of Joab [was] one of the thirty; Elhanan theson of Dodo of Bethlehem, 

{23:25} Shammah the Harodite, Elika theHarodite, 

{23:26} Helez the Paltite, Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite,

{23:27} Abiezer the Anethothite, Mebunnai the Hushathite, 

{23:28}Zalmon the Ahohite, Maharai the Netophathite, 

{23:29} Heleb the son ofBaanah, a Netophathite, Ittai the son of Ribai out of Gibeah of thechildren of Benjamin, 

{23:30} Benaiah the Pirathonite, Hiddai of thebrooks of Gaash, 

{23:31} Abi-albon the Arbathite, Azmaveth theBarhumite, 

{23:32} Eliahba the Shaalbonite, of the sons of Jashen,Jonathan, 

{23:33} Shammah the Hararite, Ahiam the son of Sharar theHararite, 

{23:34} Eliphelet the son of Ahasbai, the son of theMaachathite, Eliam the son of Ahithophel the Gilonite, 

{23:35} Hezraithe Carmelite, Paarai the Arbite, 

{23:36} Igal the son of Nathan ofZobah, Bani the Gadite, 

{23:37} Zelek the Ammonite, Nahari theBeerothite, armourbearer to Joab the son of Zeruiah, 

{23:38} Ira anIthrite, Gareb an Ithrite, 

{23:39} Uriah the Hittite: thirty and sevenin all.   

{24:1} And again the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel,and he moved David against them to say, Go, number Israel and Judah.

{24:2} For the king said to Joab the captain of the host, which [was]with him, Go now through all the tribes of Israel, from Dan even toBeer-sheba, and number ye the people, that I may know the number of thepeople. 

{24:3} And Joab said unto the king, Now the LORD thy God addunto the people, how many soever they be, an hundredfold, and that theeyes of my lord the king may see [it:] but why doth my lord the kingdelight in this thing? 

{24:4} Notwithstanding the king's word prevailedagainst Joab, and against the captains of the host. And Joab and thecaptains of the host went out from the presence of the king, to numberthe people of Israel.   

{24:5} And they passed over Jordan, and pitched in Aroer, on theright side of the city that [lieth] in the midst of the river of Gad,and toward Jazer: 

{24:6} Then they came to Gilead, and to the land ofTahtim-hodshi; and they came to Dan-jaan, and about to Zidon, 

{24:7}And came to the strong hold of Tyre, and to all the cities of theHivites, and of the Canaanites: and they went out to the south ofJudah, [even] to Beer-sheba. 

{24:8} So when they had gone through allthe land, they came to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twentydays. 

{24:9} And Joab gave up the sum of the number of the people untothe king: and there were in Israel eight hundred thousand valiant menthat drew the sword; and the men of Judah [were] five hundred thousandmen.   

{24:10} And David's heart smote him after that he had numbered thepeople. And David said unto the LORD, I have sinned greatly in that Ihave done: and now, I beseech thee, O LORD, take away the iniquity ofthy servant; for I have done very foolishly. 

{24:11} For when David wasup in the morning, the word of the LORD came unto the prophet Gad,David's seer, saying, 

{24:12} Go and say unto David, Thus saith theLORD, I offer thee three [things;] choose thee one of them, that I may[do it] unto thee. 

{24:13} So Gad came to David, and told him, and saidunto him, Shall seven years of famine come unto thee in thy land? orwilt thou flee three months before thine enemies, while they pursuethee? or that there be three days' pestilence in thy land? now advise,and see what answer I shall return to him that sent me. 

{24:14} AndDavid said unto Gad, I am in a great strait: let us fall now into thehand of the LORD; for his mercies [are] great: and let me not fall intothe hand of man.   

{24:15} So the LORD sent a pestilence upon Israel from the morningeven to the time appointed: and there died of the people from Dan evento Beer-sheba seventy thousand men. 

{24:16} And when the angelstretched out his hand upon Jerusalem to destroy it, the LORD repentedhim of the evil, and said to the angel that destroyed the people, It isenough: stay now thine hand. And the angel of the LORD was by thethreshingplace of Araunah the Jebusite. 

{24:17} And David spake untothe LORD when he saw the angel that smote the people, and said, Lo, Ihave sinned, and I have done wickedly: but these sheep, what have theydone? let thine hand, I pray thee, be against me, and against myfather's house.   

{24:18} And Gad came that day to David, and said unto him, Go up,rear an altar unto the LORD in the threshingfloor of Araunah theJebusite. 

{24:19} And David, according to the saying of Gad, went up asthe LORD commanded. 

{24:20} And Araunah looked, and saw the king andhis servants coming on toward him: and Araunah went out, and bowedhimself before the king on his face upon the ground. 

{24:21} AndAraunah said, Wherefore is my lord the king come to his servant? AndDavid said, To buy the threshingfloor of thee, to build an altar untothe LORD, that the plague may be stayed from the people. 

{24:22} AndAraunah said unto David, Let my lord the king take and offer up what[seemeth] good unto him: behold, [here be] oxen for burnt sacrifice,and threshing instruments and [other] instruments of the oxen for wood.

{24:23} All [these] things did Araunah, [as] a king, give unto theking. And Araunah said unto the king, The LORD thy God accept thee.

{24:24} And the king said unto Araunah, Nay; but I will surely buy [it]of thee at a price: neither will I offer burnt offerings unto the LORDmy God of that which doth cost me nothing. So David bought thethreshingfloor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver. 

{24:25} AndDavid built there an altar unto the LORD, and offered burnt offeringsand peace offerings. So the LORD was intreated for the land, and theplague was stayed from Israel.
