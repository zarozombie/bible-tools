{The Gospel According to St. Matthew   

{1:1} The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David,the son of Abraham. 

{1:2} Abraham begat Isaac; and Isaac begat Jacob;and Jacob begat Judas and his brethren; 

{1:3} And Judas begat Pharesand Zara of Thamar; and Phares begat Esrom; and Esrom begat Aram; 

{1:4}And Aram begat Aminadab; and Aminadab begat Naasson; and Naasson begatSalmon; 

{1:5} And Salmon begat Booz of Rachab; and Booz begat Obed ofRuth; and Obed begat Jesse; 

{1:6} And Jesse begat David the king; andDavid the king begat Solomon of her [that had been the wife] of Urias;

{1:7} And Solomon begat Roboam; and Roboam begat Abia; and Abia begatAsa; 

{1:8} And Asa begat Josaphat; and Josaphat begat Joram; and Jorambegat Ozias; 

{1:9} And Ozias begat Joatham; and Joatham begat Achaz;and Achaz begat Ezekias; 

{1:10} And Ezekias begat Manasses; andManasses begat Amon; and Amon begat Josias; 

{1:11} And Josias begatJechonias and his brethren, about the time they were carried away toBabylon: 

{1:12} And after they were brought to Babylon, Jechonias begatSalathiel; and Salathiel begat Zorobabel; 

{1:13} And Zorobabel begatAbiud; and Abiud begat Eliakim; and Eliakim begat Azor; 

{1:14} And Azorbegat Sadoc; and Sadoc begat Achim; and Achim begat Eliud; 

{1:15} AndEliud begat Eleazar; and Eleazar begat Matthan; and Matthan begatJacob; 

{1:16} And Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom wasborn Jesus, who is called Christ. 

{1:17} So all the generations fromAbraham to David [are] fourteen generations; and from David until thecarrying away into Babylon [are] fourteen generations; and from thecarrying away into Babylon unto Christ [are] fourteen generations.   

{1:18} Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise: When as hismother Mary was espoused to Joseph, before they came together, she wasfound with child of the Holy Ghost. 

{1:19} Then Joseph her husband,being a just [man,] and not willing to make her a publick example, wasminded to put her away privily. 

{1:20} But while he thought on thesethings, behold, the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream,saying, Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thywife: for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost. 

{1:21}And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name JESUS:for he shall save his people from their sins. 

{1:22} Now all this wasdone, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by theprophet, saying, 

{1:23} Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shallbring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which beinginterpreted is, God with us. 

{1:24} Then Joseph being raised from sleepdid as the angel of the Lord had bidden him, and took unto him hiswife: 

{1:25} And knew her not till she had brought forth her firstbornson: and he called his name JESUS.   

{2:1} Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judaea in the days ofHerod the king, behold, there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem,

{2:2} Saying, Where is he that is born King of the Jews? for we haveseen his star in the east, and are come to worship him. 

{2:3} WhenHerod the king had heard [these things,] he was troubled, and allJerusalem with him. 

{2:4} And when he had gathered all the chiefpriests and scribes of the people together, he demanded of them whereChrist should be born. 

{2:5} And they said unto him, In Bethlehem ofJudaea: for thus it is written by the prophet, 

{2:6} And thouBethlehem, in the land of Juda, art not the least among the princes ofJuda: for out of thee shall come a Governor, that shall rule my peopleIsrael. 

{2:7} Then Herod, when he had privily called the wise men,enquired of them diligently what time the star appeared. 

{2:8} And hesent them to Bethlehem, and said, Go and search diligently for theyoung child; and when ye have found [him,] bring me word again, that Imay come and worship him also. 

{2:9} When they had heard the king, theydeparted; and, lo, the star, which they saw in the east, went beforethem, till it came and stood over where the young child was. 

{2:10}When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy.   

{2:11} And when they were come into the house, they saw the youngchild with Mary his mother, and fell down, and worshipped him: and whenthey had opened their treasures, they presented unto him gifts; gold,and frankincense, and myrrh. 

{2:12} And being warned of God in a dreamthat they should not return to Herod, they departed into their owncountry another way. 

{2:13} And when they were departed, behold, theangel of the Lord appeareth to Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise, andtake the young child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and be thouthere until I bring thee word: for Herod will seek the young child todestroy him. 

{2:14} When he arose, he took the young child and hismother by night, and departed into Egypt: 

{2:15} And was there untilthe death of Herod: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of theLord by the prophet, saying, Out of Egypt have I called my son.   

{2:16} Then Herod, when he saw that he was mocked of the wise men,was exceeding wroth, and sent forth, and slew all the children thatwere in Bethlehem, and in all the coasts thereof, from two years oldand under, according to the time which he had diligently enquired ofthe wise men. 

{2:17} Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremythe prophet, saying, 

{2:18} In Rama was there a voice heard,lamentation, and weeping, and great mourning, Rachel weeping [for] herchildren, and would not be comforted, because they are not.   

{2:19} But when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lordappeareth in a dream to Joseph in Egypt, 

{2:20} Saying, Arise, and takethe young child and his mother, and go into the land of Israel: forthey are dead which sought the young child's life. 

{2:21} And he arose,and took the young child and his mother, and came into the land ofIsrael. 

{2:22} But when he heard that Archelaus did reign in Judaea inthe room of his father Herod, he was afraid to go thither:notwithstanding, being warned of God in a dream, he turned aside intothe parts of Galilee: 

{2:23} And he came and dwelt in a city calledNazareth: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets,He shall be called a Nazarene.   

{3:1} In those days came John the Baptist, preaching in thewilderness of Judaea, 

{3:2} And saying, Repent ye: for the kingdom ofheaven is at hand. 

{3:3} For this is he that was spoken of by theprophet Esaias, saying, The voice of one crying in the wilderness,Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight. 

{3:4} And thesame John had his raiment of camel's hair, and a leathern girdle abouthis loins; and his meat was locusts and wild honey. 

{3:5} Then went outto him Jerusalem, and all Judaea, and all the region round aboutJordan, 

{3:6} And were baptized of him in Jordan, confessing their sins.   

{3:7} But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees come tohis baptism, he said unto them, O generation of vipers, who hath warnedyou to flee from the wrath to come? 

{3:8} Bring forth therefore fruitsmeet for repentance: 

{3:9} And think not to say within yourselves, Wehave Abraham to [our] father: for I say unto you, that God is able ofthese stones to raise up children unto Abraham. 

{3:10} And now also theaxe is laid unto the root of the trees: therefore every tree whichbringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.

{3:11} I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance: but he thatcometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy tobear: he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and [with] fire: 

{3:12}Whose fan [is] in his hand, and he will throughly purge his floor, andgather his wheat into the garner; but he will burn up the chaff withunquenchable fire.   

{3:13} Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan unto John, to bebaptized of him. 

{3:14} But John forbad him, saying, I have need to bebaptized of thee, and comest thou to me? 

{3:15} And Jesus answeringsaid unto him, Suffer [it to be so] now: for thus it becometh us tofulfil all righteousness. Then he suffered him. 

{3:16} And Jesus, whenhe was baptized, went up straightway out of the water: and, lo, theheavens were opened unto him, and he saw the Spirit of God descendinglike a dove, and lighting upon him: 

{3:17} And lo a voice from heaven,saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.   

{4:1} Then was Jesus led up of the Spirit into the wilderness to betempted of the devil. 

{4:2} And when he had fasted forty days and fortynights, he was afterward an hungred. 

{4:3} And when the tempter came tohim, he said, If thou be the Son of God, command that these stones bemade bread. 

{4:4} But he answered and said, It is written, Man shallnot live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of themouth of God. 

{4:5} Then the devil taketh him up into the holy city,and setteth him on a pinnacle of the temple, 

{4:6} And saith unto him,If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself down: for it is written, Heshall give his angels charge concerning thee: and in [their] hands theyshall bear thee up, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against astone. 

{4:7} Jesus said unto him, It is written again, Thou shalt nottempt the Lord thy God. 

{4:8} Again, the devil taketh him up into anexceeding high mountain, and sheweth him all the kingdoms of the world,and the glory of them; 

{4:9} And saith unto him, All these things willI give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me. 

{4:10} Then saithJesus unto him, Get thee hence, Satan: for it is written, Thou shaltworship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve. 

{4:11} Thenthe devil leaveth him, and, behold, angels came and ministered unto him.   

{4:12} Now when Jesus had heard that John was cast into prison, hedeparted into Galilee; 

{4:13} And leaving Nazareth, he came and dweltin Capernaum, which is upon the sea coast, in the borders of Zabulonand Nephthalim: 

{4:14} That it might be fulfilled which was spoken byEsaias the prophet, saying, 

{4:15} The land of Zabulon, and the land ofNephthalim, [by] the way of the sea, beyond Jordan, Galilee of theGentiles; 

{4:16} The people which sat in darkness saw great light; andto them which sat in the region and shadow of death light is sprung up.

{4:17} From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent: forthe kingdom of heaven is at hand.   

{4:18} And Jesus, walking by the sea of Galilee, saw two brethren,Simon called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea:for they were fishers. 

{4:19} And he saith unto them, Follow me, and Iwill make you fishers of men. 

{4:20} And they straightway left [their]nets, and followed him. 

{4:21} And going on from thence, he saw othertwo brethren, James [the son] of Zebedee, and John his brother, in aship with Zebedee their father, mending their nets; and he called them.

{4:22} And they immediately left the ship and their father, andfollowed him.   

{4:23} And Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching in theirsynagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing allmanner of sickness and all manner of disease among the people. 

{4:24}And his fame went throughout all Syria: and they brought unto him allsick people that were taken with divers diseases and torments, andthose which were possessed with devils, and those which were lunatick,and those that had the palsy; and he healed them. 

{4:25} And therefollowed him great multitudes of people from Galilee, and [from]Decapolis, and [from] Jerusalem, and [from] Judaea, and [from] beyondJordan.   

{5:1} And seeing the multitudes, he went up into a mountain: andwhen he was set, his disciples came unto him: 

{5:2} And he opened hismouth, and taught them, saying, 

{5:3} Blessed [are] the poor in spirit:for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. 

{5:4} Blessed [are] they thatmourn: for they shall be comforted. 

{5:5} Blessed [are] the meek: forthey shall inherit the earth. 

{5:6} Blessed [are] they which do hungerand thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled. 

{5:7} Blessed[are] the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy. 

{5:8} Blessed [are]the pure in heart: for they shall see God. 

{5:9} Blessed [are] thepeacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God. 

{5:10}Blessed [are] they which are persecuted for righteousness sake: fortheirs is the kingdom of heaven. 

{5:11} Blessed are ye, when [men]shall revile you, and persecute [you,] and shall say all manner of evilagainst you falsely, for my sake. 

{5:12} Rejoice, and be exceedingglad: for great [is] your reward in heaven: for so persecuted they theprophets which were before you.   

{5:13} Ye are the salt of the earth: but if the salt have lost hissavour, wherewith shall it be salted? it is thenceforth good fornothing, but to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot of men.

{5:14} Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hillcannot be hid. 

{5:15} Neither do men light a candle, and put it under abushel, but on a candlestick; and it giveth light unto all that are inthe house. 

{5:16} Let your light so shine before men, that they may seeyour good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.   

{5:17} Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets:I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil. 

{5:18} For verily I say untoyou, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wisepass from the law, till all be fulfilled. 

{5:19} Whosoever thereforeshall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, heshall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shalldo and teach [them,] the same shall be called great in the kingdom ofheaven. 

{5:20} For I say unto you, That except your righteousness shallexceed [the righteousness] of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in nocase enter into the kingdom of heaven.   

{5:21} Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thoushalt not kill; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of thejudgment: 

{5:22} But I say unto you, That whosoever is angry with hisbrother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment: andwhosoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of thecouncil: but whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be in danger of hellfire. 

{5:23} Therefore if thou bring thy gift to the altar, and thererememberest that thy brother hath ought against thee; 

{5:24} Leavethere thy gift before the altar, and go thy way; first be reconciled tothy brother, and then come and offer thy gift. 

{5:25} Agree with thineadversary quickly, whiles thou art in the way with him; lest at anytime the adversary deliver thee to the judge, and the judge deliverthee to the officer, and thou be cast into prison. 

{5:26} Verily I sayunto thee, Thou shalt by no means come out thence, till thou hast paidthe uttermost farthing.   

{5:27} Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thoushalt not commit adultery: 

{5:28} But I say unto you, That whosoeverlooketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with heralready in his heart. 

{5:29} And if thy right eye offend thee, pluck itout, and cast [it] from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one ofthy members should perish, and not [that] thy whole body should be castinto hell. 

{5:30} And if thy right hand offend thee, cut if off, andcast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thymembers should perish, and not [that] thy whole body should be castinto hell. 

{5:31} It hath been said, Whosoever shall put away his wife,let him give her a writing of divorcement: 

{5:32} But I say unto you,That whosoever shall put away his wife, saving for the cause offornication, causeth her to commit adultery: and whosoever shall marryher that is divorced committeth adultery.   

{5:33} Again, ye have heard that it hath been said by them of oldtime, Thou shalt not forswear thyself, but shalt perform unto the Lordthine oaths: 

{5:34} But I say unto you, Swear not at all; neither byheaven; for it is God's throne: 

{5:35} Nor by the earth; for it is hisfootstool: neither by Jerusalem; for it is the city of the great King.

{5:36} Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, because thou canst notmake one hair white or black. 

{5:37} But let your communication be,Yea, yea; Nay, nay: for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil.   

{5:38} Ye have heard that it hath been said, An eye for an eye, anda tooth for a tooth: 

{5:39} But I say unto you, That ye resist notevil: but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to himthe other also. 

{5:40} And if any man will sue thee at the law, andtake away thy coat, let him have [thy] cloke also. 

{5:41} And whosoevershall compel thee to go a mile, go with him twain. 

{5:42} Give to himthat asketh thee, and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thouaway.   

{5:43} Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thyneighbour, and hate thine enemy. 

{5:44} But I say unto you, Love yourenemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, andpray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you; 

{5:45}That ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven: for hemaketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain onthe just and on the unjust. 

{5:46} For if ye love them which love you,what reward have ye? do not even the publicans the same? 

{5:47} And ifye salute your brethren only, what do ye more [than others?] do noteven the publicans so? 

{5:48} Be ye therefore perfect, even as yourFather which is in heaven is perfect.   

{6:1} Take heed that ye do not your alms before men, to be seen ofthem: otherwise ye have no reward of your Father which is in heaven.

{6:2} Therefore when thou doest [thine] alms, do not sound a trumpetbefore thee, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets,that they may have glory of men. Verily I say unto you, They have theirreward. 

{6:3} But when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know whatthy right hand doeth: 

{6:4} That thine alms may be in secret: and thyFather which seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly.   

{6:5} And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites[are:] for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in thecorners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say untoyou, They have their reward. 

{6:6} But thou, when thou prayest, enterinto thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Fatherwhich is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall rewardthee openly. 

{6:7} But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as theheathen [do:] for they think that they shall be heard for their muchspeaking. 

{6:8} Be not ye therefore like unto them: for your Fatherknoweth what things ye have need of, before ye ask him. 

{6:9} Afterthis manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowedbe thy name. 

{6:10} Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as [itis] in heaven. 

{6:11} Give us this day our daily bread. 

{6:12} Andforgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors. 

{6:13} And lead us notinto temptation, but deliver us from evil: For thine is the kingdom,and the power, and the glory, for ever. Amen. 

{6:14} For if ye forgivemen their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you:

{6:15} But if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will yourFather forgive your trespasses.   

{6:16} Moreover when ye fast, be not, as the hypocrites, of a sadcountenance: for they disfigure their faces, that they may appear untomen to fast. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward. 

{6:17} Butthou, when thou fastest, anoint thine head, and wash thy face; 

{6:18}That thou appear not unto men to fast, but unto thy Father which is insecret: and thy Father, which seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly.   

{6:19} Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where mothand rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal:

{6:20} But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neithermoth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through norsteal: 

{6:21} For where your treasure is, there will your heart bealso. 

{6:22} The light of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eyebe single, thy whole body shall be full of light. 

{6:23} But if thineeye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of darkness. If therefore thelight that is in thee be darkness, how great [is] that darkness!   

{6:24} No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate theone, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despisethe other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon. 

{6:25} Therefore I say untoyou, Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shalldrink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the lifemore than meat, and the body than raiment? 

{6:26} Behold the fowls ofthe air: for they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns;yet your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are ye not much better thanthey? 

{6:27} Which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto hisstature? 

{6:28} And why take ye thought for raiment? Consider thelilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do theyspin: 

{6:29} And yet I say unto you, That even Solomon in all his glorywas not arrayed like one of these. 

{6:30} Wherefore, if God so clothethe grass of the field, which to day is, and to morrow is cast into theoven, [shall he] not much more [clothe] you, O ye of little faith?

{6:31} Therefore take no thought, saying, What shall we eat? or, Whatshall we drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed? 

{6:32} (For afterall these things do the Gentiles seek:) for your heavenly Fatherknoweth that ye have need of all these things. 

{6:33} But seek ye firstthe kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shallbe added unto you. 

{6:34} Take therefore no thought for the morrow: forthe morrow shall take thought for the things of itself. Sufficient untothe day [is] the evil thereof.   

{7:1} Judge not, that ye be not judged. 

{7:2} For with what judgmentye judge, ye shall be judged: and with what measure ye mete, it shallbe measured to you again. 

{7:3} And why beholdest thou the mote that isin thy brother's eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine owneye? 

{7:4} Or how wilt thou say to thy brother, Let me pull out themote out of thine eye; and, behold, a beam [is] in thine own eye? 

{7:5}Thou hypocrite, first cast out the beam out of thine own eye; and thenshalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother's eye.   

{7:6} Give not that which is holy unto the dogs, neither cast yeyour pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, andturn again and rend you.   

{7:7} Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find;knock, and it shall be opened unto you: 

{7:8} For every one that askethreceiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh itshall be opened. 

{7:9} Or what man is there of you, whom if his son askbread, will he give him a stone? 

{7:10} Or if he ask a fish, will hegive him a serpent? 

{7:11} If ye then, being evil, know how to givegood gifts unto your children, how much more shall your Father which isin heaven give good things to them that ask him? 

{7:12} Therefore allthings whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so tothem: for this is the law and the prophets.   

{7:13} Enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide [is] the gate, andbroad [is] the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there bewhich go in thereat: 

{7:14} Because strait [is] the gate, and narrow[is] the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it.   

{7:15} Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep'sclothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves. 

{7:16} Ye shall knowthem by their fruits. Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs ofthistles? 

{7:17} Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; buta corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit. 

{7:18} A good tree cannotbring forth evil fruit, neither [can] a corrupt tree bring forth goodfruit. 

{7:19} Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewndown, and cast into the fire. 

{7:20} Wherefore by their fruits ye shallknow them.   

{7:21} Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enterinto the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Fatherwhich is in heaven. 

{7:22} Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord,have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast outdevils? and in thy name done many wonderful works? 

{7:23} And then willI profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that workiniquity.   

{7:24} Therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeththem, I will liken him unto a wise man, which built his house upon arock: 

{7:25} And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the windsblew, and beat upon that house; and it fell not: for it was foundedupon a rock. 

{7:26} And every one that heareth these sayings of mine,and doeth them not, shall be likened unto a foolish man, which builthis house upon the sand: 

{7:27} And the rain descended, and the floodscame, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell: andgreat was the fall of it. 

{7:28} And it came to pass, when Jesus hadended these sayings, the people were astonished at his doctrine: 

{7:29}For he taught them as [one] having authority, and not as the scribes.   

{8:1} When he was come down from the mountain, great multitudesfollowed him. 

{8:2} And, behold, there came a leper and worshipped him,saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean. 

{8:3} And Jesusput forth [his] hand, and touched him, saying, I will; be thou clean.And immediately his leprosy was cleansed. 

{8:4} And Jesus saith untohim, See thou tell no man; but go thy way, shew thyself to the priest,and offer the gift that Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them.   

{8:5} And when Jesus was entered into Capernaum, there came unto hima centurion, beseeching him, 

{8:6} And saying, Lord, my servant liethat home sick of the palsy, grievously tormented. 

{8:7} And Jesus saithunto him, I will come and heal him. 

{8:8} The centurion answered andsaid, Lord, I am not worthy that thou shouldest come under my roof: butspeak the word only, and my servant shall be healed. 

{8:9} For I am aman under authority, having soldiers under me: and I say to this [man,]Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to myservant, Do this, and he doeth [it. ]

{8:10} When Jesus heard [it,] hemarvelled, and said to them that followed, Verily I say unto you, Ihave not found so great faith, no, not in Israel. 

{8:11} And I say untoyou, That many shall come from the east and west, and shall sit downwith Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven. 

{8:12}But the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer darkness:there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth. 

{8:13} And Jesus saidunto the centurion, Go thy way; and as thou hast believed, so be itdone unto thee. And his servant was healed in the selfsame hour.   

{8:14} And when Jesus was come into Peter's house, he saw his wife'smother laid, and sick of a fever. 

{8:15} And he touched her hand, andthe fever left her: and she arose, and ministered unto them.   

{8:16} When the even was come, they brought unto him many that werepossessed with devils: and he cast out the spirits with [his] word, andhealed all that were sick: 

{8:17} That it might be fulfilled which wasspoken by Esaias the prophet, saying, Himself took our infirmities, andbare [our] sicknesses.   

{8:18} Now when Jesus saw great multitudes about him, he gavecommandment to depart unto the other side. 

{8:19} And a certain scribecame, and said unto him, Master, I will follow thee whithersoever thougoest. 

{8:20} And Jesus saith unto him, The foxes have holes, and thebirds of the air [have] nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay[his] head. 

{8:21} And another of his disciples said unto him, Lord,suffer me first to go and bury my father. 

{8:22} But Jesus said untohim, Follow me; and let the dead bury their dead.   

{8:23} And when he was entered into a ship, his disciples followedhim. 

{8:24} And, behold, there arose a great tempest in the sea,insomuch that the ship was covered with the waves: but he was asleep.

{8:25} And his disciples came to [him,] and awoke him, saying, Lord,save us: we perish. 

{8:26} And he saith unto them, Why are ye fearful,O ye of little faith? Then he arose, and rebuked the winds and the sea;and there was a great calm. 

{8:27} But the men marvelled, saying, Whatmanner of man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey him!   

{8:28} And when he was come to the other side into the country ofthe Gergesenes, there met him two possessed with devils, coming out ofthe tombs, exceeding fierce, so that no man might pass by that way.

{8:29} And, behold, they cried out, saying, What have we to do withthee, Jesus, thou Son of God? art thou come hither to torment us beforethe time? 

{8:30} And there was a good way off from them an herd of manyswine feeding. 

{8:31} So the devils besought him, saying, If thou castus out, suffer us to go away into the herd of swine. 

{8:32} And he saidunto them, Go. And when they were come out, they went into the herd ofswine: and, behold, the whole herd of swine ran violently down a steepplace into the sea, and perished in the waters. 

{8:33} And they thatkept them fled, and went their ways into the city, and told everything, and what was befallen to the possessed of the devils. 

{8:34}And, behold, the whole city came out to meet Jesus: and when they sawhim, they besought [him] that he would depart out of their coasts.   

{9:1} And he entered into a ship, and passed over, and came into hisown city. 

{9:2} And, behold, they brought to him a man sick of thepalsy, lying on a bed: and Jesus seeing their faith said unto the sickof the palsy; Son, be of good cheer; thy sins be forgiven thee. 

{9:3}And, behold, certain of the scribes said within themselves, This [man]blasphemeth. 

{9:4} And Jesus knowing their thoughts said, Whereforethink ye evil in your hearts? 

{9:5} For whether is easier, to say,[Thy] sins be forgiven thee; or to say, Arise, and walk? 

{9:6} But thatye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins,(then saith he to the sick of the palsy,) Arise, take up thy bed, andgo unto thine house. 

{9:7} And he arose, and departed to his house.

{9:8} But when the multitudes saw [it,] they marvelled, and glorifiedGod, which had given such power unto men.   

{9:9} And as Jesus passed forth from thence, he saw a man, namedMatthew, sitting at the receipt of custom: and he saith unto him,Follow me. And he arose, and followed him.   

{9:10} And it came to pass, as Jesus sat at meat in the house,behold, many publicans and sinners came and sat down with him and hisdisciples. 

{9:11} And when the Pharisees saw [it,] they said unto hisdisciples, Why eateth your Master with publicans and sinners? 

{9:12}But when Jesus heard [that,] he said unto them, They that be whole neednot a physician, but they that are sick. 

{9:13} But go ye and learnwhat [that] meaneth, I will have mercy, and not sacrifice: for I am notcome to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.   

{9:14} Then came to him the disciples of John, saying, Why do we andthe Pharisees fast oft, but thy disciples fast not? 

{9:15} And Jesussaid unto them, Can the children of the bridechamber mourn, as long asthe bridegroom is with them? but the days will come, when thebridegroom shall be taken from them, and then shall they fast. 

{9:16}No man putteth a piece of new cloth unto an old garment, for that whichis put in to fill it up taketh from the garment, and the rent is madeworse. 

{9:17} Neither do men put new wine into old bottles: else thebottles break, and the wine runneth out, and the bottles perish: butthey put new wine into new bottles, and both are preserved.   

{9:18} While he spake these things unto them, behold, there came acertain ruler, and worshipped him, saying, My daughter is even nowdead: but come and lay thy hand upon her, and she shall live. 

{9:19}And Jesus arose, and followed him, and [so did] his disciples.   

{9:20} And, behold, a woman, which was diseased with an issue ofblood twelve years, came behind [him,] and touched the hem of hisgarment: 

{9:21} For she said within herself, If I may but touch hisgarment, I shall be whole. 

{9:22} But Jesus turned him about, and whenhe saw her, he said, Daughter, be of good comfort; thy faith hath madethee whole. And the woman was made whole from that hour. 

{9:23} Andwhen Jesus came into the ruler's house, and saw the minstrels and thepeople making a noise, 

{9:24} He said unto them, Give place: for themaid is not dead, but sleepeth. And they laughed him to scorn. 

{9:25}But when the people were put forth, he went in, and took her by thehand, and the maid arose. 

{9:26} And the fame hereof went abroad intoall that land.   

{9:27} And when Jesus departed thence, two blind men followed him,crying, and saying, [Thou] Son of David, have mercy on us. 

{9:28} Andwhen he was come into the house, the blind men came to him: and Jesussaith unto them, Believe ye that I am able to do this? They said untohim, Yea, Lord. 

{9:29} Then touched he their eyes, saying, According toyour faith be it unto you. 

{9:30} And their eyes were opened; and Jesusstraitly charged them, saying, See [that] no man know [it. ]

{9:31} Butthey, when they were departed, spread abroad his fame in all thatcountry.   

{9:32} As they went out, behold, they brought to him a dumb manpossessed with a devil. 

{9:33} And when the devil was cast out, thedumb spake: and the multitudes marvelled, saying, It was never so seenin Israel. 

{9:34} But the Pharisees said, He casteth out devils throughthe prince of the devils. 

{9:35} And Jesus went about all the citiesand villages, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel ofthe kingdom, and healing every sickness and every disease among thepeople.   

{9:36} But when he saw the multitudes, he was moved with compassionon them, because they fainted, and were scattered abroad, as sheephaving no shepherd. 

{9:37} Then saith he unto his disciples, Theharvest truly [is] plenteous, but the labourers [are] few; 

{9:38} Prayye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he will send forth labourersinto his harvest.   

{10:1} And when he had called unto [him] his twelve disciples, hegave them power [against] unclean spirits, to cast them out, and toheal all manner of sickness and all manner of disease. 

{10:2} Now thenames of the twelve apostles are these; The first, Simon, who is calledPeter, and Andrew his brother; James [the son] of Zebedee, and John hisbrother; 

{10:3} Philip, and Bartholomew; Thomas, and Matthew thepublican; James [the son] of Alphaeus, and Lebbaeus, whose surname wasThaddaeus; 

{10:4} Simon the Canaanite, and Judas Iscariot, who alsobetrayed him. 

{10:5} These twelve Jesus sent forth, and commanded them,saying, Go not into the way of the Gentiles, and into [any] city of theSamaritans enter ye not: 

{10:6} But go rather to the lost sheep of thehouse of Israel. 

{10:7} And as ye go, preach, saying, The kingdom ofheaven is at hand. 

{10:8} Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise thedead, cast out devils: freely ye have received, freely give. 

{10:9}Provide neither gold, nor silver, nor brass in your purses, 

{10:10} Norscrip for [your] journey, neither two coats, neither shoes, nor yetstaves: for the workman is worthy of his meat. 

{10:11} And intowhatsoever city or town ye shall enter, enquire who in it is worthy;and there abide till ye go thence. 

{10:12} And when ye come into anhouse, salute it. 

{10:13} And if the house be worthy, let your peacecome upon it: but if it be not worthy, let your peace return to you.

{10:14} And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear your words, whenye depart out of that house or city, shake off the dust of your feet.

{10:15} Verily I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for the landof Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of judgment, than for that city.   

{10:16} Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves: beye therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves. 

{10:17} Butbeware of men: for they will deliver you up to the councils, and theywill scourge you in their synagogues; 

{10:18} And ye shall be broughtbefore governors and kings for my sake, for a testimony against themand the Gentiles. 

{10:19} But when they deliver you up, take no thoughthow or what ye shall speak: for it shall be given you in that same hourwhat ye shall speak. 

{10:20} For it is not ye that speak, but theSpirit of your Father which speaketh in you. 

{10:21} And the brothershall deliver up the brother to death, and the father the child: andthe children shall rise up against [their] parents, and cause them tobe put to death. 

{10:22} And ye shall be hated of all [men] for myname's sake: but he that endureth to the end shall be saved. 

{10:23}But when they persecute you in this city, flee ye into another: forverily I say unto you, Ye shall not have gone over the cities ofIsrael, till the Son of man be come. 

{10:24} The disciple is not above[his] master, nor the servant above his lord. 

{10:25} It is enough forthe disciple that he be as his master, and the servant as his lord. Ifthey have called the master of the house Beelzebub, how much more[shall they call] them of his household? 

{10:26} Fear them nottherefore: for there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed;and hid, that shall not be known. 

{10:27} What I tell you in darkness,[that] speak ye in light: and what ye hear in the ear, [that] preach yeupon the housetops. 

{10:28} And fear not them which kill the body, butare not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able todestroy both soul and body in hell. 

{10:29} Are not two sparrows soldfor a farthing? and one of them shall not fall on the ground withoutyour Father. 

{10:30} But the very hairs of your head are all numbered.

{10:31} Fear ye not therefore, ye are of more value than many sparrows.

{10:32} Whosoever therefore shall confess me before men, him will Iconfess also before my Father which is in heaven. 

{10:33} But whosoevershall deny me before men, him will I also deny before my Father whichis in heaven. 

{10:34} Think not that I am come to send peace on earth:I came not to send peace, but a sword. 

{10:35} For I am come to set aman at variance against his father, and the daughter against hermother, and the daughter in law against her mother in law. 

{10:36} Anda man's foes [shall be] they of his own household. 

{10:37} He thatloveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me: and he thatloveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me. 

{10:38} And hethat taketh not his cross, and followeth after me, is not worthy of me.

{10:39} He that findeth his life shall lose it: and he that loseth hislife for my sake shall find it.   

{10:40} He that receiveth you receiveth me, and he that receiveth mereceiveth him that sent me. 

{10:41} He that receiveth a prophet in thename of a prophet shall receive a prophet's reward; and he thatreceiveth a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receivea righteous man's reward. 

{10:42} And whosoever shall give to drinkunto one of these little ones a cup of cold [water] only in the name ofa disciple, verily I say unto you, he shall in no wise lose his reward.   

{11:1} And it came to pass, when Jesus had made an end of commandinghis twelve disciples, he departed thence to teach and to preach intheir cities. 

{11:2} Now when John had heard in the prison the works ofChrist, he sent two of his disciples, 

{11:3} And said unto him, Artthou he that should come, or do we look for another? 

{11:4} Jesusanswered and said unto them, Go and shew John again those things whichye do hear and see: 

{11:5} The blind receive their sight, and the lamewalk, the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, the dead are raisedup, and the poor have the gospel preached to them. 

{11:6} And blessedis [he,] whosoever shall not be offended in me.   

{11:7} And as they departed, Jesus began to say unto the multitudesconcerning John, What went ye out into the wilderness to see? A reedshaken with the wind? 

{11:8} But what went ye out for to see? A manclothed in soft raiment? behold, they that wear soft [clothing] are inkings' houses. 

{11:9} But what went ye out for to see? A prophet? yea,I say unto you, and more than a prophet. 

{11:10} For this is [he,] ofwhom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, whichshall prepare thy way before thee. 

{11:11} Verily I say unto you, Amongthem that are born of women there hath not risen a greater than Johnthe Baptist: notwithstanding he that is least in the kingdom of heavenis greater than he. 

{11:12} And from the days of John the Baptist untilnow the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence, and the violent take itby force. 

{11:13} For all the prophets and the law prophesied untilJohn. 

{11:14} And if ye will receive [it,] this is Elias, which was forto come. 

{11:15} He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.   

{11:16} But whereunto shall I liken this generation? It is like untochildren sitting in the markets, and calling unto their fellows,

{11:17} And saying, We have piped unto you, and ye have not danced; wehave mourned unto you, and ye have not lamented. 

{11:18} For John cameneither eating nor drinking, and they say, He hath a devil. 

{11:19} TheSon of man came eating and drinking, and they say, Behold a mangluttonous, and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners. Butwisdom is justified of her children.   

{11:20} Then began he to upbraid the cities wherein most of hismighty works were done, because they repented not: 

{11:21} Woe untothee, Chorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida! for if the mighty works,which were done in you, had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they wouldhave repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes. 

{11:22} But I say untoyou, It shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the day ofjudgment, than for you. 

{11:23} And thou, Capernaum, which art exaltedunto heaven, shalt be brought down to hell: for if the mighty works,which have been done in thee, had been done in Sodom, it would haveremained until this day. 

{11:24} But I say unto you, That it shall bemore tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment, than forthee.   

{11:25} At that time Jesus answered and said, I thank thee, OFather, Lord of heaven and earth, because thou hast hid these thingsfrom the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes. 

{11:26}Even so, Father: for so it seemed good in thy sight. 

{11:27} All thingsare delivered unto me of my Father: and no man knoweth the Son, but theFather; neither knoweth any man the Father, save the Son, and [he] towhomsoever the Son will reveal [him.]   

{11:28} Come unto me, all [ye] that labour and are heavy laden, andI will give you rest. 

{11:29} Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me;for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto yoursouls. 

{11:30} For my yoke [is] easy, and my burden is light.   

{12:1} At that time Jesus went on the sabbath day through the corn;and his disciples were an hungred, and began to pluck the ears of corn,and to eat. 

{12:2} But when the Pharisees saw [it,] they said unto him,Behold, thy disciples do that which is not lawful to do upon thesabbath day. 

{12:3} But he said unto them, Have ye not read what Daviddid, when he was an hungred, and they that were with him; 

{12:4} How heentered into the house of God, and did eat the shewbread, which was notlawful for him to eat, neither for them which were with him, but onlyfor the priests? 

{12:5} Or have ye not read in the law, how that on thesabbath days the priests in the temple profane the sabbath, and areblameless? 

{12:6} But I say unto you, That in this place is [one]greater than the temple. 

{12:7} But if ye had known what [this]meaneth, I will have mercy, and not sacrifice, ye would not havecondemned the guiltless. 

{12:8} For the Son of man is Lord even of thesabbath day. 

{12:9} And when he was departed thence, he went into theirsynagogue:   

{12:10} And, behold, there was a man which had [his] hand withered.And they asked him, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath days?that they might accuse him. 

{12:11} And he said unto them, What manshall there be among you, that shall have one sheep, and if it fallinto a pit on the sabbath day, will he not lay hold on it, and lift[it] out? 

{12:12} How much then is a man better than a sheep? Whereforeit is lawful to do well on the sabbath days. 

{12:13} Then saith he tothe man, Stretch forth thine hand. And he stretched [it] forth; and itwas restored whole, like as the other.   

{12:14} Then the Pharisees went out, and held a council against him,how they might destroy him. 

{12:15} But when Jesus knew [it,] hewithdrew himself from thence: and great multitudes followed him, and hehealed them all; 

{12:16} And charged them that they should not make himknown: 

{12:17} That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaiasthe prophet, saying, 

{12:18} Behold my servant, whom I have chosen; mybeloved, in whom my soul is well pleased: I will put my spirit uponhim, and he shall shew judgment to the Gentiles. 

{12:19} He shall notstrive, nor cry; neither shall any man hear his voice in the streets.

{12:20} A bruised reed shall he not break, and smoking flax shall henot quench, till he send forth judgment unto victory. 

{12:21} And inhis name shall the Gentiles trust.   

{12:22} Then was brought unto him one possessed with a devil, blind,and dumb: and he healed him, insomuch that the blind and dumb bothspake and saw. 

{12:23} And all the people were amazed, and said, Is notthis the son of David? 

{12:24} But when the Pharisees heard [it,] theysaid, This [fellow] doth not cast out devils, but by Beelzebub theprince of the devils. 

{12:25} And Jesus knew their thoughts, and saidunto them, Every kingdom divided against itself is brought todesolation; and every city or house divided against itself shall notstand: 

{12:26} And if Satan cast out Satan, he is divided againsthimself; how shall then his kingdom stand? 

{12:27} And if I byBeelzebub cast out devils, by whom do your children cast [them] out?therefore they shall be your judges. 

{12:28} But if I cast out devilsby the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God is come unto you. 

{12:29}Or else how can one enter into a strong man's house, and spoil hisgoods, except he first bind the strong man? and then he will spoil hishouse. 

{12:30} He that is not with me is against me; and he thatgathereth not with me scattereth abroad.   

{12:31} Wherefore I say unto you, All manner of sin and blasphemyshall be forgiven unto men: but the blasphemy [against] the [Holy]Ghost shall not be forgiven unto men. 

{12:32} And whosoever speaketh aword against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but whosoeverspeaketh against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven him, neitherin this world, neither in the [world] to come. 

{12:33} Either make thetree good, and his fruit good; or else make the tree corrupt, and hisfruit corrupt: for the tree is known by [his] fruit. 

{12:34} Ogeneration of vipers, how can ye, being evil, speak good things? forout of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh. 

{12:35} A goodman out of the good treasure of the heart bringeth forth good things:and an evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth evil things.

{12:36} But I say unto you, That every idle word that men shall speak,they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment. 

{12:37} For bythy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt becondemned.   

{12:38} Then certain of the scribes and of the Pharisees answered,saying, Master, we would see a sign from thee. 

{12:39} But he answeredand said unto them, An evil and adulterous generation seeketh after asign; and there shall no sign be given to it, but the sign of theprophet Jonas: 

{12:40} For as Jonas was three days and three nights inthe whale's belly; so shall the Son of man be three days and threenights in the heart of the earth. 

{12:41} The men of Nineveh shall risein judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: because theyrepented at the preaching of Jonas; and, behold, a greater than Jonas[is] here. 

{12:42} The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgmentwith this generation, and shall condemn it: for she came from theuttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and,behold, a greater than Solomon [is] here. 

{12:43} When the uncleanspirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through dry places, seekingrest, and findeth none. 

{12:44} Then he saith, I will return into myhouse from whence I came out; and when he is come, he findeth [it]empty, swept, and garnished. 

{12:45} Then goeth he, and taketh withhimself seven other spirits more wicked than himself, and they enter inand dwell there: and the last [state] of that man is worse than thefirst. Even so shall it be also unto this wicked generation.   

{12:46} While he yet talked to the people, behold, [his] mother andhis brethren stood without, desiring to speak with him. 

{12:47} Thenone said unto him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren stand without,desiring to speak with thee. 

{12:48} But he answered and said unto himthat told him, Who is my mother? and who are my brethren? 

{12:49} Andhe stretched forth his hand toward his disciples, and said, Behold mymother and my brethren! 

{12:50} For whosoever shall do the will of myFather which is in heaven, the same is my brother, and sister, andmother.   

{13:1} The same day went Jesus out of the house, and sat by the seaside. 

{13:2} And great multitudes were gathered together unto him, sothat he went into a ship, and sat; and the whole multitude stood on theshore. 

{13:3} And he spake many things unto them in parables, saying,Behold, a sower went forth to sow; 

{13:4} And when he sowed, some[seeds] fell by the way side, and the fowls came and devoured them up:

{13:5} Some fell upon stony places, where they had not much earth: andforthwith they sprung up, because they had no deepness of earth: 

{13:6}And when the sun was up, they were scorched; and because they had noroot, they withered away. 

{13:7} And some fell among thorns; and thethorns sprung up, and choked them: 

{13:8} But other fell into goodground, and brought forth fruit, some an hundredfold, some sixtyfold,some thirtyfold. 

{13:9} Who hath ears to hear, let him hear. 

{13:10}And the disciples came, and said unto him, Why speakest thou unto themin parables? 

{13:11} He answered and said unto them, Because it isgiven unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but tothem it is not given. 

{13:12} For whosoever hath, to him shall begiven, and he shall have more abundance: but whosoever hath not, fromhim shall be taken away even that he hath. 

{13:13} Therefore speak I tothem in parables: because they seeing see not; and hearing they hearnot, neither do they understand. 

{13:14} And in them is fulfilled theprophecy of Esaias, which saith, By hearing ye shall hear, and shallnot understand; and seeing ye shall see, and shall not perceive:

{13:15} For this people's heart is waxed gross, and [their] ears aredull of hearing, and their eyes they have closed; lest at any time theyshould see with [their] eyes, and hear with [their] ears, and shouldunderstand with [their] heart, and should be converted, and I shouldheal them. 

{13:16} But blessed [are] your eyes, for they see: and yourears, for they hear. 

{13:17} For verily I say unto you, That manyprophets and righteous [men] have desired to see [those things] whichye see, and have not seen [them;] and to hear [those things] which yehear, and have not heard [them.]   

{13:18} Hear ye therefore the parable of the sower. 

{13:19} When anyone heareth the word of the kingdom, and understandeth [it] not, thencometh the wicked [one,] and catcheth away that which was sown in hisheart. This is he which received seed by the way side. 

{13:20} But hethat received the seed into stony places, the same is he that heareththe word, and anon with joy receiveth it; 

{13:21} Yet hath he not rootin himself, but dureth for a while: for when tribulation or persecutionariseth because of the word, by and by he is offended. 

{13:22} He alsothat received seed among the thorns is he that heareth the word; andthe care of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, choke theword, and he becometh unfruitful. 

{13:23} But he that received seedinto the good ground is he that heareth the word, and understandeth[it;] which also beareth fruit, and bringeth forth, some anhundredfold, some sixty, some thirty.   

{13:24} Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdomof heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field:

{13:25} But while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among thewheat, and went his way. 

{13:26} But when the blade was sprung up, andbrought forth fruit, then appeared the tares also. 

{13:27} So theservants of the householder came and said unto him, Sir, didst not thousow good seed in thy field? from whence then hath it tares? 

{13:28} Hesaid unto them, An enemy hath done this. The servants said unto him,Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up? 

{13:29} But he said, Nay;lest while ye gather up the tares, ye root up also the wheat with them.

{13:30} Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time ofharvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the tares,and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into mybarn.   

{13:31} Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdomof heaven is like to a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, andsowed in his field: 

{13:32} Which indeed is the least of all seeds: butwhen it is grown, it is the greatest among herbs, and becometh a tree,so that the birds of the air come and lodge in the branches thereof.   

{13:33} Another parable spake he unto them; The kingdom of heaven islike unto leaven, which a woman took, and hid in three measures ofmeal, till the whole was leavened. 

{13:34} All these things spake Jesusunto the multitude in parables; and without a parable spake he not untothem: 

{13:35} That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by theprophet, saying, I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter thingswhich have been kept secret from the foundation of the world. 

{13:36}Then Jesus sent the multitude away, and went into the house: and hisdisciples came unto him, saying, Declare unto us the parable of thetares of the field. 

{13:37} He answered and said unto them, He thatsoweth the good seed is the Son of man; 

{13:38} The field is the world;the good seed are the children of the kingdom; but the tares are thechildren of the wicked [one; ]

{13:39} The enemy that sowed them is thedevil; the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are theangels. 

{13:40} As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in thefire; so shall it be in the end of this world. 

{13:41} The Son of manshall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdomall things that offend, and them which do iniquity; 

{13:42} And shallcast them into a furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashingof teeth. 

{13:43} Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun inthe kingdom of their Father. Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.   

{13:44} Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in afield; the which when a man hath found, he hideth, and for joy thereofgoeth and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field.   

{13:45} Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man,seeking goodly pearls: 

{13:46} Who, when he had found one pearl ofgreat price, went and sold all that he had, and bought it.   

{13:47} Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net, that wascast into the sea, and gathered of every kind: 

{13:48} Which, when itwas full, they drew to shore, and sat down, and gathered the good intovessels, but cast the bad away. 

{13:49} So shall it be at the end ofthe world: the angels shall come forth, and sever the wicked from amongthe just, 

{13:50} And shall cast them into the furnace of fire: thereshall be wailing and gnashing of teeth. 

{13:51} Jesus saith unto them,Have ye understood all these things? They say unto him, Yea, Lord.

{13:52} Then said he unto them, Therefore every scribe [which is]instructed unto the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man [that is] anhouseholder, which bringeth forth out of his treasure [things] new andold.   

{13:53} And it came to pass, [that] when Jesus had finished theseparables, he departed thence. 

{13:54} And when he was come into his owncountry, he taught them in their synagogue, insomuch that they wereastonished, and said, Whence hath this [man] this wisdom, and [these]mighty works? 

{13:55} Is not this the carpenter's son? is not hismother called Mary? and his brethren, James, and Joses, and Simon, andJudas? 

{13:56} And his sisters, are they not all with us? Whence thenhath this [man] all these things? 

{13:57} And they were offended inhim. But Jesus said unto them, A prophet is not without honour, save inhis own country, and in his own house. 

{13:58} And he did not manymighty works there because of their unbelief.   

{14:1} At that time Herod the tetrarch heard of the fame of Jesus,

{14:2} And said unto his servants, This is John the Baptist; he isrisen from the dead; and therefore mighty works do shew forththemselves in him.   

{14:3} For Herod had laid hold on John, and bound him, and put [him]in prison for Herodias' sake, his brother Philip's wife. 

{14:4} ForJohn said unto him, It is not lawful for thee to have her. 

{14:5} Andwhen he would have put him to death, he feared the multitude, becausethey counted him as a prophet. 

{14:6} But when Herod's birthday waskept, the daughter of Herodias danced before them, and pleased Herod.

{14:7} Whereupon he promised with an oath to give her whatsoever shewould ask. 

{14:8} And she, being before instructed of her mother, said,Give me here John Baptist's head in a charger. 

{14:9} And the king wassorry: nevertheless for the oath's sake, and them which sat with him atmeat, he commanded [it] to be given [her. ]

{14:10} And he sent, andbeheaded John in the prison. 

{14:11} And his head was brought in acharger, and given to the damsel: and she brought [it] to her mother.

{14:12} And his disciples came, and took up the body, and buried it,and went and told Jesus.   

{14:13} When Jesus heard [of it,] he departed thence by ship into adesert place apart: and when the people had heard [thereof,] theyfollowed him on foot out of the cities. 

{14:14} And Jesus went forth,and saw a great multitude, and was moved with compassion toward them,and he healed their sick.   

{14:15} And when it was evening, his disciples came to him, saying,This is a desert place, and the time is now past; send the multitudeaway, that they may go into the villages, and buy themselves victuals.

{14:16} But Jesus said unto them, They need not depart; give ye them toeat. 

{14:17} And they say unto him, We have here but five loaves, andtwo fishes. 

{14:18} He said, Bring them hither to me. 

{14:19} And hecommanded the multitude to sit down on the grass, and took the fiveloaves, and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed, andbrake, and gave the loaves to [his] disciples, and the disciples to themultitude. 

{14:20} And they did all eat, and were filled: and they tookup of the fragments that remained twelve baskets full. 

{14:21} And theythat had eaten were about five thousand men, beside women and children.   

{14:22} And straightway Jesus constrained his disciples to get intoa ship, and to go before him unto the other side, while he sent themultitudes away. 

{14:23} And when he had sent the multitudes away, hewent up into a mountain apart to pray: and when the evening was come,he was there alone. 

{14:24} But the ship was now in the midst of thesea, tossed with waves: for the wind was contrary. 

{14:25} And in thefourth watch of the night Jesus went unto them, walking on the sea.

{14:26} And when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they weretroubled, saying, It is a spirit; and they cried out for fear. 

{14:27}But straightway Jesus spake unto them, saying, Be of good cheer; it isI; be not afraid. 

{14:28} And Peter answered him and said, Lord, if itbe thou, bid me come unto thee on the water. 

{14:29} And he said, Come.And when Peter was come down out of the ship, he walked on the water,to go to Jesus. 

{14:30} But when he saw the wind boisterous, he wasafraid; and beginning to sink, he cried, saying, Lord, save me. 

{14:31}And immediately Jesus stretched forth [his] hand, and caught him, andsaid unto him, O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?

{14:32} And when they were come into the ship, the wind ceased. 

{14:33}Then they that were in the ship came and worshipped him, saying, Of atruth thou art the Son of God.   

{14:34} And when they were gone over, they came into the land ofGennesaret. 

{14:35} And when the men of that place had knowledge ofhim, they sent out into all that country round about, and brought untohim all that were diseased; 

{14:36} And besought him that they mightonly touch the hem of his garment: and as many as touched were madeperfectly whole.   

{15:1} Then came to Jesus scribes and Pharisees, which were ofJerusalem, saying, 

{15:2} Why do thy disciples transgress the traditionof the elders? for they wash not their hands when they eat bread.

{15:3} But he answered and said unto them, Why do ye also transgressthe commandment of God by your tradition? 

{15:4} For God commanded,saying, Honour thy father and mother: and, He that curseth father ormother, let him die the death. 

{15:5} But ye say, Whosoever shall sayto [his] father or [his] mother, [It is] a gift, by whatsoever thoumightest be profited by me; 

{15:6} And honour not his father or hismother, [he shall be free.] Thus have ye made the commandment of God ofnone effect by your tradition. 

{15:7} [Ye] hypocrites, well did Esaiasprophesy of you, saying, 

{15:8} This people draweth nigh unto me withtheir mouth, and honoureth me with [their] lips; but their heart is farfrom me. 

{15:9} But in vain they do worship me, teaching [for]doctrines the commandments of men.   

{15:10} And he called the multitude, and said unto them, Hear, andunderstand: 

{15:11} Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man;but that which cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man. 

{15:12}Then came his disciples, and said unto him, Knowest thou that thePharisees were offended, after they heard this saying? 

{15:13} But heanswered and said, Every plant, which my heavenly Father hath notplanted, shall be rooted up. 

{15:14} Let them alone: they be blindleaders of the blind. And if the blind lead the blind, both shall fallinto the ditch. 

{15:15} Then answered Peter and said unto him, Declareunto us this parable. 

{15:16} And Jesus said, Are ye also yet withoutunderstanding? 

{15:17} Do not ye yet understand, that whatsoeverentereth in at the mouth goeth into the belly, and is cast out into thedraught? 

{15:18} But those things which proceed out of the mouth comeforth from the heart; and they defile the man. 

{15:19} For out of theheart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts,false witness, blasphemies: 

{15:20} These are [the things] which defilea man: but to eat with unwashen hands defileth not a man.   

{15:21} Then Jesus went thence, and departed into the coasts of Tyreand Sidon. 

{15:22} And, behold, a woman of Canaan came out of the samecoasts, and cried unto him, saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, [thou]Son of David; my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil. 

{15:23} Buthe answered her not a word. And his disciples came and besought him,saying, Send her away; for she crieth after us. 

{15:24} But he answeredand said, I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel.

{15:25} Then came she and worshipped him, saying, Lord, help me.

{15:26} But he answered and said, It is not meet to take the children'sbread, and to cast [it] to dogs. 

{15:27} And she said, Truth, Lord: yetthe dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters' table.

{15:28} Then Jesus answered and said unto her, O woman, great [is] thyfaith: be it unto thee even as thou wilt. And her daughter was madewhole from that very hour. 

{15:29} And Jesus departed from thence, andcame nigh unto the sea of Galilee; and went up into a mountain, and satdown there. 

{15:30} And great multitudes came unto him, having withthem [those that were] lame, blind, dumb, maimed, and many others, andcast them down at Jesus' feet; and he healed them: 

{15:31} Insomuchthat the multitude wondered, when they saw the dumb to speak, themaimed to be whole, the lame to walk, and the blind to see: and theyglorified the God of Israel.   

{15:32} Then Jesus called his disciples [unto him,] and said, I havecompassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now threedays, and have nothing to eat: and I will not send them away fasting,lest they faint in the way. 

{15:33} And his disciples say unto him,Whence should we have so much bread in the wilderness, as to fill sogreat a multitude? 

{15:34} And Jesus saith unto them, How many loaveshave ye? And they said, Seven, and a few little fishes. 

{15:35} And hecommanded the multitude to sit down on the ground. 

{15:36} And he tookthe seven loaves and the fishes, and gave thanks, and brake [them,] andgave to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude. 

{15:37} Andthey did all eat, and were filled: and they took up of the broken[meat] that was left seven baskets full. 

{15:38} And they that did eatwere four thousand men, beside women and children. 

{15:39} And he sentaway the multitude, and took ship, and came into the coasts of Magdala,   

{16:1} The Pharisees also with the Sadducees came, and temptingdesired him that he would shew them a sign from heaven. 

{16:2} Heanswered and said unto them, When it is evening, ye say, [It will be]fair weather: for the sky is red. 

{16:3} And in the morning, [It willbe] foul weather to day: for the sky is red and lowring. O [ye]hypocrites, ye can discern the face of the sky; but can ye not[discern] the signs of the times? 

{16:4} A wicked and adulterousgeneration seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be given untoit, but the sign of the prophet Jonas. And he left them, and departed.

{16:5} And when his disciples were come to the other side, they hadforgotten to take bread.   

{16:6} Then Jesus said unto them, Take heed and beware of the leavenof the Pharisees and of the Sadducees. 

{16:7} And they reasoned amongthemselves, saying, [It is] because we have taken no bread. 

{16:8}[Which] when Jesus perceived, he said unto them, O ye of little faith,why reason ye among yourselves, because ye have brought no bread?

{16:9} Do ye not yet understand, neither remember the five loaves ofthe five thousand, and how many baskets ye took up? 

{16:10} Neither theseven loaves of the four thousand, and how many baskets ye took up?

{16:11} How is it that ye do not understand that I spake [it] not toyou concerning bread, that ye should beware of the leaven of thePharisees and of the Sadducees? 

{16:12} Then understood they how thathe bade [them] not beware of the leaven of bread, but of the doctrineof the Pharisees and of the Sadducees.   

{16:13} When Jesus came into the coasts of Caesarea Philippi, heasked his disciples, saying, Whom do men say that I the Son of man am?

{16:14} And they said, Some [say that thou art] John the Baptist: some,Elias; and others, Jeremias, or one of the prophets. 

{16:15} He saithunto them, But whom say ye that I am? 

{16:16} And Simon Peter answeredand said, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God. 

{16:17} AndJesus answered and said unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon Barjona: forflesh and blood hath not revealed [it] unto thee, but my Father whichis in heaven. 

{16:18} And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter,and upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shallnot prevail against it. 

{16:19} And I will give unto thee the keys ofthe kingdom of heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall bebound in heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall beloosed in heaven. 

{16:20} Then charged he his disciples that theyshould tell no man that he was Jesus the Christ.   

{16:21} From that time forth began Jesus to shew unto his disciples,how that he must go unto Jerusalem, and suffer many things of theelders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and be raisedagain the third day. 

{16:22} Then Peter took him, and began to rebukehim, saying, Be it far from thee, Lord: this shall not be unto thee.

{16:23} But he turned, and said unto Peter, Get thee behind me, Satan:thou art an offence unto me: for thou savourest not the things that beof God, but those that be of men.   

{16:24} Then said Jesus unto his disciples, If any [man] will comeafter me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.

{16:25} For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: and whosoeverwill lose his life for my sake shall find it. 

{16:26} For what is a manprofited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? orwhat shall a man give in exchange for his soul? 

{16:27} For the Son ofman shall come in the glory of his Father with his angels; and then heshall reward every man according to his works. 

{16:28} Verily I sayunto you, There be some standing here, which shall not taste of death,till they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom.   

{17:1} And after six days Jesus taketh Peter, James, and John hisbrother, and bringeth them up into an high mountain apart, 

{17:2} Andwas transfigured before them: and his face did shine as the sun, andhis raiment was white as the light. 

{17:3} And, behold, there appearedunto them Moses and Elias talking with him. 

{17:4} Then answered Peter,and said unto Jesus, Lord, it is good for us to be here: if thou wilt,let us make here three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses,and one for Elias. 

{17:5} While he yet spake, behold, a bright cloudovershadowed them: and behold a voice out of the cloud, which said,This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear ye him. 

{17:6}And when the disciples heard [it,] they fell on their face, and weresore afraid. 

{17:7} And Jesus came and touched them, and said, Arise,and be not afraid. 

{17:8} And when they had lifted up their eyes, theysaw no man, save Jesus only. 

{17:9} And as they came down from themountain, Jesus charged them, saying, Tell the vision to no man, untilthe Son of man be risen again from the dead. 

{17:10} And his disciplesasked him, saying, Why then say the scribes that Elias must first come?

{17:11} And Jesus answered and said unto them, Elias truly shall firstcome, and restore all things. 

{17:12} But I say unto you, That Elias iscome already, and they knew him not, but have done unto him whatsoeverthey listed. Likewise shall also the Son of man suffer of them. 

{17:13}Then the disciples understood that he spake unto them of John theBaptist.   

{17:14} And when they were come to the multitude, there came to hima [certain] man, kneeling down to him, and saying, 

{17:15} Lord, havemercy on my son: for he is lunatick, and sore vexed: for ofttimes hefalleth into the fire, and oft into the water. 

{17:16} And I broughthim to thy disciples, and they could not cure him. 

{17:17} Then Jesusanswered and said, O faithless and perverse generation, how long shallI be with you? how long shall I suffer you? bring him hither to me.

{17:18} And Jesus rebuked the devil; and he departed out of him: andthe child was cured from that very hour. 

{17:19} Then came thedisciples to Jesus apart, and said, Why could not we cast him out?

{17:20} And Jesus said unto them, Because of your unbelief: for verilyI say unto you, If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shallsay unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; and it shallremove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you. 

{17:21} Howbeit thiskind goeth not out but by prayer and fasting.   

{17:22} And while they abode in Galilee, Jesus said unto them, TheSon of man shall be betrayed into the hands of men: 

{17:23} And theyshall kill him, and the third day he shall be raised again. And theywere exceeding sorry.   

{17:24} And when they were come to Capernaum, they that receivedtribute [money] came to Peter, and said, Doth not your master paytribute? 

{17:25} He saith, Yes. And when he was come into the house,Jesus prevented him, saying, What thinkest thou, Simon? of whom do thekings of the earth take custom or tribute? of their own children, or ofstrangers? 

{17:26} Peter saith unto him, Of strangers. Jesus saith untohim, Then are the children free. 

{17:27} Notwithstanding, lest weshould offend them, go thou to the sea, and cast an hook, and take upthe fish that first cometh up; and when thou hast opened his mouth,thou shalt find a piece of money: that take, and give unto them for meand thee.   

{18:1} At the same time came the disciples unto Jesus, saying, Whois the greatest in the kingdom of heaven? 

{18:2} And Jesus called alittle child unto him, and set him in the midst of them, 

{18:3} Andsaid, Verily I say unto you, Except ye be converted, and become aslittle children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven. 

{18:4}Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child, the sameis greatest in the kingdom of heaven. 

{18:5} And whoso shall receiveone such little child in my name receiveth me. 

{18:6} But whoso shalloffend one of these little ones which believe in me, it were better forhim that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and [that] he weredrowned in the depth of the sea.   

{18:7} Woe unto the world because of offences! for it must needs bethat offences come; but woe to that man by whom the offence cometh!

{18:8} Wherefore if thy hand or thy foot offend thee, cut them off, andcast [them] from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life halt ormaimed, rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast intoeverlasting fire. 

{18:9} And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out,and cast [it] from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life withone eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire. 

{18:10}Take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones; for I say untoyou, That in heaven their angels do always behold the face of my Fatherwhich is in heaven. 

{18:11} For the Son of man is come to save thatwhich was lost. 

{18:12} How think ye? if a man have an hundred sheep,and one of them be gone astray, doth he not leave the ninety and nine,and goeth into the mountains, and seeketh that which is gone astray?

{18:13} And if so be that he find it, verily I say unto you, herejoiceth more of that [sheep,] than of the ninety and nine which wentnot astray. 

{18:14} Even so it is not the will of your Father which isin heaven, that one of these little ones should perish.   

{18:15} Moreover if thy brother shall trespass against thee, go andtell him his fault between thee and him alone: if he shall hear thee,thou hast gained thy brother. 

{18:16} But if he will not hear [thee,then] take with thee one or two more, that in the mouth of two or threewitnesses every word may be established. 

{18:17} And if he shallneglect to hear them, tell [it] unto the church: but if he neglect tohear the church, let him be unto thee as an heathen man and a publican.

{18:18} Verily I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shallbe bound in heaven: and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall beloosed in heaven. 

{18:19} Again I say unto you, That if two of youshall agree on earth as touching any thing that they shall ask, itshall be done for them of my Father which is in heaven. 

{18:20} Forwhere two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in themidst of them.   

{18:21} Then came Peter to him, and said, Lord, how oft shall mybrother sin against me, and I forgive him? till seven times? 

{18:22}Jesus saith unto him, I say not unto thee, Until seven times: but,Until seventy times seven.   

{18:23} Therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened unto a certainking, which would take account of his servants. 

{18:24} And when he hadbegun to reckon, one was brought unto him, which owed him ten thousandtalents. 

{18:25} But forasmuch as he had not to pay, his lord commandedhim to be sold, and his wife, and children, and all that he had, andpayment to be made. 

{18:26} The servant therefore fell down, andworshipped him, saying, Lord, have patience with me, and I will paythee all. 

{18:27} Then the lord of that servant was moved withcompassion, and loosed him, and forgave him the debt. 

{18:28} But thesame servant went out, and found one of his fellowservants, which owedhim an hundred pence: and he laid hands on him, and took [him] by thethroat, saying, Pay me that thou owest. 

{18:29} And his fellowservantfell down at his feet, and besought him, saying, Have patience with me,and I will pay thee all. 

{18:30} And he would not: but went and casthim into prison, till he should pay the debt. 

{18:31} So when hisfellowservants saw what was done, they were very sorry, and came andtold unto their lord all that was done. 

{18:32} Then his lord, afterthat he had called him, said unto him, O thou wicked servant, I forgavethee all that debt, because thou desiredst me: 

{18:33} Shouldest notthou also have had compassion on thy fellowservant, even as I had pityon thee? 

{18:34} And his lord was wroth, and delivered him to thetormentors, till he should pay all that was due unto him. 

{18:35} Solikewise shall my heavenly Father do also unto you, if ye from yourhearts forgive not every one his brother their trespasses.   

{19:1} And it came to pass, [that] when Jesus had finished thesesayings, he departed from Galilee, and came into the coasts of Judaeabeyond Jordan; 

{19:2} And great multitudes followed him; and he healedthem there.   

{19:3} The Pharisees also came unto him, tempting him, and sayingunto him, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause?

{19:4} And he answered and said unto them, Have ye not read, that hewhich made [them] at the beginning made them male and female, 

{19:5}And said, For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and shallcleave to his wife: and they twain shall be one flesh? 

{19:6} Whereforethey are no more twain, but one flesh. What therefore God hath joinedtogether, let not man put asunder. 

{19:7} They say unto him, Why didMoses then command to give a writing of divorcement, and to put heraway? 

{19:8} He saith unto them, Moses because of the hardness of yourhearts suffered you to put away your wives: but from the beginning itwas not so. 

{19:9} And I say unto you, Whosoever shall put away hiswife, except [it be] for fornication, and shall marry another,committeth adultery: and whoso marrieth her which is put away dothcommit adultery.   

{19:10} His disciples say unto him, If the case of the man be sowith [his] wife, it is not good to marry. 

{19:11} But he said untothem, All [men] cannot receive this saying, save [they] to whom it isgiven. 

{19:12} For there are some eunuchs, which were so born from[their] mother's womb: and there are some eunuchs, which were madeeunuchs of men: and there be eunuchs, which have made themselveseunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's sake. He that is able to receive[it,] let him receive [it.]   

{19:13} Then were there brought unto him little children, that heshould put [his] hands on them, and pray: and the disciples rebukedthem. 

{19:14} But Jesus said, Suffer little children, and forbid themnot, to come unto me: for of such is the kingdom of heaven. 

{19:15} Andhe laid [his] hands on them, and departed thence.   

{19:16} And, behold, one came and said unto him, Good Master, whatgood thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life? 

{19:17} And hesaid unto him, Why callest thou me good? [there is] none good but one,[that is,] God: but if thou wilt enter into life, keep thecommandments. 

{19:18} He saith unto him, Which? Jesus said, Thou shaltdo no murder, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not steal,Thou shalt not bear false witness, 

{19:19} Honour thy father and [thy]mother: and, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. 

{19:20} Theyoung man saith unto him, All these things have I kept from my youthup: what lack I yet? 

{19:21} Jesus said unto him, If thou wilt beperfect, go [and] sell that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thoushalt have treasure in heaven: and come [and] follow me. 

{19:22} Butwhen the young man heard that saying, he went away sorrowful: for hehad great possessions.   

{19:23} Then said Jesus unto his disciples, Verily I say unto you,That a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven. 

{19:24}And again I say unto you, It is easier for a camel to go through theeye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.

{19:25} When his disciples heard [it,] they were exceedingly amazed,saying, Who then can be saved? 

{19:26} But Jesus beheld [them,] andsaid unto them, With men this is impossible; but with God all thingsare possible.   

{19:27} Then answered Peter and said unto him, Behold, we haveforsaken all, and followed thee; what shall we have therefore? 

{19:28}And Jesus said unto them, Verily I say unto you, That ye which havefollowed me, in the regeneration when the Son of man shall sit in thethrone of his glory, ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging thetwelve tribes of Israel. 

{19:29} And every one that hath forsakenhouses, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, orchildren, or lands, for my name's sake, shall receive an hundredfold,and shall inherit everlasting life. 

{19:30} But many [that are] firstshall be last; and the last [shall be] first.   

{20:1} For the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man [that is] anhouseholder, which went out early in the morning to hire labourers intohis vineyard. 

{20:2} And when he had agreed with the labourers for apenny a day, he sent them into his vineyard. 

{20:3} And he went outabout the third hour, and saw others standing idle in the marketplace,

{20:4} And said unto them; Go ye also into the vineyard, and whatsoeveris right I will give you. And they went their way. 

{20:5} Again he wentout about the sixth and ninth hour, and did likewise. 

{20:6} And aboutthe eleventh hour he went out, and found others standing idle, andsaith unto them, Why stand ye here all the day idle? 

{20:7} They sayunto him, Because no man hath hired us. He saith unto them, Go ye alsointo the vineyard; and whatsoever is right, [that] shall ye receive.

{20:8} So when even was come, the lord of the vineyard saith unto hissteward, Call the labourers, and give them [their] hire, beginning fromthe last unto the first. 

{20:9} And when they came that [were hired]about the eleventh hour, they received every man a penny. 

{20:10} Butwhen the first came, they supposed that they should have received more;and they likewise received every man a penny. 

{20:11} And when they hadreceived it, they murmured against the goodman of the house, 

{20:12}Saying, These last have wrought [but] one hour, and thou hast made themequal unto us, which have borne the burden and heat of the day. 

{20:13}But he answered one of them, and said, Friend, I do thee no wrong:didst not thou agree with me for a penny? 

{20:14} Take [that] thine[is,] and go thy way: I will give unto this last, even as unto thee.

{20:15} Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own? Isthine eye evil, because I am good? 

{20:16} So the last shall be first,and the first last: for many be called, but few chosen.   

{20:17} And Jesus going up to Jerusalem took the twelve disciplesapart in the way, and said unto them, 

{20:18} Behold, we go up toJerusalem; and the Son of man shall be betrayed unto the chief priestsand unto the scribes, and they shall condemn him to death, 

{20:19} Andshall deliver him to the Gentiles to mock, and to scourge, and tocrucify [him:] and the third day he shall rise again.   

{20:20} Then came to him the mother of Zebedee's children with hersons, worshipping [him,] and desiring a certain thing of him. 

{20:21}And he said unto her, What wilt thou? She saith unto him, Grant thatthese my two sons may sit, the one on thy right hand, and the other onthe left, in thy kingdom. 

{20:22} But Jesus answered and said, Ye knownot what ye ask. Are ye able to drink of the cup that I shall drink of,and to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with? They sayunto him, We are able. 

{20:23} And he saith unto them, Ye shall drinkindeed of my cup, and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptizedwith: but to sit on my right hand, and on my left, is not mine to give,but [it shall be given to them] for whom it is prepared of my Father.

{20:24} And when the ten heard [it,] they were moved with indignationagainst the two brethren. 

{20:25} But Jesus called them [unto him,] andsaid, Ye know that the princes of the Gentiles exercise dominion overthem, and they that are great exercise authority upon them. 

{20:26} Butit shall not be so among you: but whosoever will be great among you,let him be your minister; 

{20:27} And whosoever will be chief amongyou, let him be your servant: 

{20:28} Even as the Son of man came notto be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransomfor many. 

{20:29} And as they departed from Jericho, a great multitudefollowed him.   

{20:30} And, behold, two blind men sitting by the way side, whenthey heard that Jesus passed by, cried out, saying, Have mercy on us, OLord, [thou] Son of David. 

{20:31} And the multitude rebuked them,because they should hold their peace: but they cried the more, saying,Have mercy on us, O Lord, [thou] Son of David. 

{20:32} And Jesus stoodstill, and called them, and said, What will ye that I shall do untoyou? 

{20:33} They say unto him, Lord, that our eyes may be opened.

{20:34} So Jesus had compassion [on them,] and touched their eyes: andimmediately their eyes received sight, and they followed him.   

{21:1} And when they drew nigh unto Jerusalem, and were come toBethphage, unto the mount of Olives, then sent Jesus two disciples,

{21:2} Saying unto them, Go into the village over against you, andstraightway ye shall find an ass tied, and a colt with her: loose[them,] and bring [them] unto me. 

{21:3} And if any [man] say oughtunto you, ye shall say, The Lord hath need of them; and straightway hewill send them. 

{21:4} All this was done, that it might be fulfilledwhich was spoken by the prophet, saying, 

{21:5} Tell ye the daughter ofSion, Behold, thy King cometh unto thee, meek, and sitting upon an ass,and a colt the foal of an ass. 

{21:6} And the disciples went, and didas Jesus commanded them, 

{21:7} And brought the ass, and the colt, andput on them their clothes, and they set [him] thereon. 

{21:8} And avery great multitude spread their garments in the way; others cut downbranches from the trees, and strawed [them] in the way. 

{21:9} And themultitudes that went before, and that followed, cried, saying, Hosannato the Son of David: Blessed [is] he that cometh in the name of theLord; Hosanna in the highest. 

{21:10} And when he was come intoJerusalem, all the city was moved, saying, Who is this? 

{21:11} And themultitude said, This is Jesus the prophet of Nazareth of Galilee.   

{21:12} And Jesus went into the temple of God, and cast out all themthat sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of themoneychangers, and the seats of them that sold doves, 

{21:13} And saidunto them, It is written, My house shall be called the house of prayer;but ye have made it a den of thieves. 

{21:14} And the blind and thelame came to him in the temple; and he healed them. 

{21:15} And whenthe chief priests and scribes saw the wonderful things that he did, andthe children crying in the temple, and saying, Hosanna to the Son ofDavid; they were sore displeased, 

{21:16} And said unto him, Hearestthou what these say? And Jesus saith unto them, Yea; have ye neverread, Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou hast perfectedpraise?   

{21:17} And he left them, and went out of the city into Bethany; andhe lodged there. 

{21:18} Now in the morning as he returned into thecity, he hungered. 

{21:19} And when he saw a fig tree in the way, hecame to it, and found nothing thereon, but leaves only, and said untoit, Let no fruit grow on thee henceforward for ever. And presently thefig tree withered away. 

{21:20} And when the disciples saw [it,] theymarvelled, saying, How soon is the fig tree withered away! 

{21:21}Jesus answered and said unto them, Verily I say unto you, If ye havefaith, and doubt not, ye shall not only do this [which is done] to thefig tree, but also if ye shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed,and be thou cast into the sea; it shall be done. 

{21:22} And allthings, whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believing, ye shall receive.   

{21:23} And when he was come into the temple, the chief priests andthe elders of the people came unto him as he was teaching, and said, Bywhat authority doest thou these things? and who gave thee thisauthority? 

{21:24} And Jesus answered and said unto them, I also willask you one thing, which if ye tell me, I in like wise will tell you bywhat authority I do these things. 

{21:25} The baptism of John, whencewas it? from heaven, or of men? And they reasoned with themselves,saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say unto us, Why did yenot then believe him? 

{21:26} But if we shall say, Of men; we fear thepeople; for all hold John as a prophet. 

{21:27} And they answeredJesus, and said, We cannot tell. And he said unto them, Neither tell Iyou by what authority I do these things.   

{21:28} But what think ye? A [certain] man had two sons; and he cameto the first, and said, Son, go work to day in my vineyard. 

{21:29} Heanswered and said, I will not: but afterward he repented, and went.

{21:30} And he came to the second, and said likewise. And he answeredand said, I [go,] sir: and went not. 

{21:31} Whether of them twain didthe will of [his] father? They say unto him, The first. Jesus saithunto them, Verily I say unto you, That the publicans and the harlots gointo the kingdom of God before you. 

{21:32} For John came unto you inthe way of righteousness, and ye believed him not: but the publicansand the harlots believed him: and ye, when ye had seen [it,] repentednot afterward, that ye might believe him.   

{21:33} Hear another parable: There was a certain householder, whichplanted a vineyard, and hedged it round about, and digged a winepressin it, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into afar country: 

{21:34} And when the time of the fruit drew near, he senthis servants to the husbandmen, that they might receive the fruits ofit. 

{21:35} And the husbandmen took his servants, and beat one, andkilled another, and stoned another. 

{21:36} Again, he sent otherservants more than the first: and they did unto them likewise. 

{21:37}But last of all he sent unto them his son, saying, They will reverencemy son. 

{21:38} But when the husbandmen saw the son, they said amongthemselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and let us seizeon his inheritance. 

{21:39} And they caught him, and cast [him] out ofthe vineyard, and slew [him. ]

{21:40} When the lord therefore of thevineyard cometh, what will he do unto those husbandmen? 

{21:41} Theysay unto him, He will miserably destroy those wicked men, and will letout [his] vineyard unto other husbandmen, which shall render him thefruits in their seasons. 

{21:42} Jesus saith unto them, Did ye neverread in the scriptures, The stone which the builders rejected, the sameis become the head of the corner: this is the Lord's doing, and it ismarvellous in our eyes? 

{21:43} Therefore say I unto you, The kingdomof God shall be taken from you, and given to a nation bringing forththe fruits thereof. 

{21:44} And whosoever shall fall on this stoneshall be broken: but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him topowder. 

{21:45} And when the chief priests and Pharisees had heard hisparables, they perceived that he spake of them. 

{21:46} But when theysought to lay hands on him, they feared the multitude, because theytook him for a prophet.   

{22:1} And Jesus answered and spake unto them again by parables, andsaid, 

{22:2} The kingdom of heaven is like unto a certain king, whichmade a marriage for his son, 

{22:3} And sent forth his servants to callthem that were bidden to the wedding: and they would not come. 

{22:4}Again, he sent forth other servants, saying, Tell them which arebidden, Behold, I have prepared my dinner: my oxen and [my] fatlings[are] killed, and all things [are] ready: come unto the marriage.

{22:5} But they made light of [it,] and went their ways, one to hisfarm, another to his merchandise: 

{22:6} And the remnant took hisservants, and entreated [them] spitefully, and slew [them. ]

{22:7} Butwhen the king heard [thereof,] he was wroth: and he sent forth hisarmies, and destroyed those murderers, and burned up their city. 

{22:8}Then saith he to his servants, The wedding is ready, but they whichwere bidden were not worthy. 

{22:9} Go ye therefore into the highways,and as many as ye shall find, bid to the marriage. 

{22:10} So thoseservants went out into the highways, and gathered together all as manyas they found, both bad and good: and the wedding was furnished withguests.   

{22:11} And when the king came in to see the guests, he saw there aman which had not on a wedding garment: 

{22:12} And he saith unto him,Friend, how camest thou in hither not having a wedding garment? And hewas speechless. 

{22:13} Then said the king to the servants, Bind himhand and foot, and take him away, and cast [him] into outer darkness;there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth. 

{22:14} For many arecalled, but few [are] chosen.   

{22:15} Then went the Pharisees, and took counsel how they mightentangle him in [his] talk. 

{22:16} And they sent out unto him theirdisciples with the Herodians, saying, Master, we know that thou arttrue, and teachest the way of God in truth, neither carest thou for any[man:] for thou regardest not the person of men. 

{22:17} Tell ustherefore, What thinkest thou? Is it lawful to give tribute untoCaesar, or not? 

{22:18} But Jesus perceived their wickedness, and said,Why tempt ye me, [ye] hypocrites? 

{22:19} Shew me the tribute money.And they brought unto him a penny. 

{22:20} And he saith unto them,Whose [is] this image and superscription? 

{22:21} They say unto him,Caesar's. Then saith he unto them, Render therefore unto Caesar thethings which are Caesar's; and unto God the things that are God's.

{22:22} When they had heard [these words,] they marvelled, and lefthim, and went their way.   

{22:23} The same day came to him the Sadducees, which say that thereis no resurrection, and asked him, 

{22:24} Saying, Master, Moses said,If a man die, having no children, his brother shall marry his wife, andraise up seed unto his brother. 

{22:25} Now there were with us sevenbrethren: and the first, when he had married a wife, deceased, and,having no issue, left his wife unto his brother: 

{22:26} Likewise thesecond also, and the third, unto the seventh. 

{22:27} And last of allthe woman died also. 

{22:28} Therefore in the resurrection whose wifeshall she be of the seven? for they all had her. 

{22:29} Jesus answeredand said unto them, Ye do err, not knowing the scriptures, nor thepower of God. 

{22:30} For in the resurrection they neither marry, norare given in marriage, but are as the angels of God in heaven. 

{22:31}But as touching the resurrection of the dead, have ye not read thatwhich was spoken unto you by God, saying, 

{22:32} I am the God ofAbraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? God is not the Godof the dead, but of the living. 

{22:33} And when the multitude heard[this,] they were astonished at his doctrine.   

{22:34} But when the Pharisees had heard that he had put theSadducees to silence, they were gathered together. 

{22:35} Then one ofthem, [which was] a lawyer, asked [him a question, ]tempting him, andsaying, 

{22:36} Master, which [is] the great commandment in the law?

{22:37} Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with allthy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. 

{22:38} Thisis the first and great commandment. 

{22:39} And the second [is] likeunto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. 

{22:40} On these twocommandments hang all the law and the prophets.   

{22:41} While the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus askedthem, 

{22:42} Saying, What think ye of Christ? whose son is he? Theysay unto him, [The Son] of David. 

{22:43} He saith unto them, How thendoth David in spirit call him Lord, saying, 

{22:44} The LORD said untomy Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine enemies thyfootstool? 

{22:45} If David then call him Lord, how is he his son?

{22:46} And no man was able to answer him a word, neither durst any[man] from that day forth ask him any more [questions.]   

{23:1} Then spake Jesus to the multitude, and to his disciples,

{23:2} Saying, The scribes and the Pharisees sit in Moses' seat: 

{23:3}All therefore whatsoever they bid you observe, [that] observe and do;but do not ye after their works: for they say, and do not. 

{23:4} Forthey bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne, and lay [them] onmen's shoulders; but they [themselves] will not move them with one oftheir fingers. 

{23:5} But all their works they do for to be seen ofmen: they make broad their phylacteries, and enlarge the borders oftheir garments, 

{23:6} And love the uppermost rooms at feasts, and thechief seats in the synagogues, 

{23:7} And greetings in the markets, andto be called of men, Rabbi, Rabbi. 

{23:8} But be not ye called Rabbi:for one is your Master, [even] Christ; and all ye are brethren. 

{23:9}And call no [man] your father upon the earth: for one is your Father,which is in heaven. 

{23:10} Neither be ye called masters: for one isyour Master, [even] Christ. 

{23:11} But he that is greatest among youshall be your servant. 

{23:12} And whosoever shall exalt himself shallbe abased; and he that shall humble himself shall be exalted.   

{23:13} But woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for yeshut up the kingdom of heaven against men: for ye neither go in[yourselves,] neither suffer ye them that are entering to go in.

{23:14} Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye devourwidows' houses, and for a pretence make long prayer: therefore ye shallreceive the greater damnation. 

{23:15} Woe unto you, scribes andPharisees, hypocrites! for ye compass sea and land to make oneproselyte, and when he is made, ye make him twofold more the child ofhell than yourselves. 

{23:16} Woe unto you, [ye] blind guides, whichsay, Whosoever shall swear by the temple, it is nothing; but whosoevershall swear by the gold of the temple, he is a debtor! 

{23:17} [Ye]fools and blind: for whether is greater, the gold, or the temple thatsanctifieth the gold? 

{23:18} And, Whosoever shall swear by the altar,it is nothing; but whosoever sweareth by the gift that is upon it, heis guilty. 

{23:19} [Ye] fools and blind: for whether [is] greater, thegift, or the altar that sanctifieth the gift? 

{23:20} Whoso thereforeshall swear by the altar, sweareth by it, and by all things thereon.

{23:21} And whoso shall swear by the temple, sweareth by it, and by himthat dwelleth therein. 

{23:22} And he that shall swear by heaven,sweareth by the throne of God, and by him that sitteth thereon. 

{23:23}Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye pay tithe ofmint and anise and cummin, and have omitted the weightier [matters] ofthe law, judgment, mercy, and faith: these ought ye to have done, andnot to leave the other undone. 

{23:24} [Ye] blind guides, which strainat a gnat, and swallow a camel. 

{23:25} Woe unto you, scribes andPharisees, hypocrites! for ye make clean the outside of the cup and ofthe platter, but within they are full of extortion and excess. 

{23:26}[Thou] blind Pharisee, cleanse first that [which is] within the cup andplatter, that the outside of them may be clean also. 

{23:27} Woe untoyou, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are like unto whitedsepulchres, which indeed appear beautiful outward, but are within fullof dead [men's] bones, and of all uncleanness. 

{23:28} Even so ye alsooutwardly appear righteous unto men, but within ye are full ofhypocrisy and iniquity. 

{23:29} Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees,hypocrites! because ye build the tombs of the prophets, and garnish thesepulchres of the righteous, 

{23:30} And say, If we had been in thedays of our fathers, we would not have been partakers with them in theblood of the prophets. 

{23:31} Wherefore ye be witnesses untoyourselves, that ye are the children of them which killed the prophets.

{23:32} Fill ye up then the measure of your fathers. 

{23:33} [Ye]serpents, [ye] generation of vipers, how can ye escape the damnation ofhell?   

{23:34} Wherefore, behold, I send unto you prophets, and wise men,and scribes: and [some] of them ye shall kill and crucify; and [some]of them shall ye scourge in your synagogues, and persecute [them] fromcity to city: 

{23:35} That upon you may come all the righteous bloodshed upon the earth, from the blood of righteous Abel unto the blood ofZacharias son of Barachias, whom ye slew between the temple and thealtar. 

{23:36} Verily I say unto you, All these things shall come uponthis generation. 

{23:37} O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, [thou] that killestthe prophets, and stonest them which are sent unto thee, how oftenwould I have gathered thy children together, even as a hen gatherethher chickens under [her] wings, and ye would not! 

{23:38} Behold, yourhouse is left unto you desolate. 

{23:39} For I say unto you, Ye shallnot see me henceforth, till ye shall say, Blessed [is] he that comethin the name of the Lord.   

{24:1} And Jesus went out, and departed from the temple: and hisdisciples came to [him] for to shew him the buildings of the temple.

{24:2} And Jesus said unto them, See ye not all these things? verily Isay unto you, There shall not be left here one stone upon another, thatshall not be thrown down.   

{24:3} And as he sat upon the mount of Olives, the disciples cameunto him privately, saying, Tell us, when shall these things be? andwhat [shall be] the sign of thy coming, and of the end of the world?

{24:4} And Jesus answered and said unto them, Take heed that no mandeceive you. 

{24:5} For many shall come in my name, saying, I amChrist; and shall deceive many. 

{24:6} And ye shall hear of wars andrumours of wars: see that ye be not troubled: for all [these things]must come to pass, but the end is not yet. 

{24:7} For nation shall riseagainst nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall befamines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places. 

{24:8} Allthese [are] the beginning of sorrows. 

{24:9} Then shall they deliveryou up to be afflicted, and shall kill you: and ye shall be hated ofall nations for my name's sake. 

{24:10} And then shall many beoffended, and shall betray one another, and shall hate one another.

{24:11} And many false prophets shall rise, and shall deceive many.

{24:12} And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall waxcold. 

{24:13} But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall besaved. 

{24:14} And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in allthe world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come.

{24:15} When ye therefore shall see the abomination of desolation,spoken of by Daniel the prophet, stand in the holy place, (whosoreadeth, let him understand:) 

{24:16} Then let them which be in Judaeaflee into the mountains: 

{24:17} Let him which is on the housetop notcome down to take any thing out of his house: 

{24:18} Neither let himwhich is in the field return back to take his clothes. 

{24:19} And woeunto them that are with child, and to them that give suck in thosedays! 

{24:20} But pray ye that your flight be not in the winter,neither on the sabbath day: 

{24:21} For then shall be greattribulation, such as was not since the beginning of the world to thistime, no, nor ever shall be. 

{24:22} And except those days should beshortened, there should no flesh be saved: but for the elect's sakethose days shall be shortened. 

{24:23} Then if any man shall say untoyou, Lo, here [is] Christ, or there; believe [it] not. 

{24:24} Forthere shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall shewgreat signs and wonders; insomuch that, if [it were] possible, theyshall deceive the very elect. 

{24:25} Behold, I have told you before.

{24:26} Wherefore if they shall say unto you, Behold, [he is] in thedesert; go not forth: behold, he is in the secret chambers; believe[it] not. 

{24:27} For as the lightning cometh out of the east, andshineth even unto the west; so shall also the coming of the Son of manbe. 

{24:28} For wheresoever the carcase is, there will the eagles begathered together.   

{24:29} Immediately after the tribulation of those days shall thesun be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the starsshall fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken:

{24:30} And then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven: andthen shall all the tribes of the earth mourn, and they shall see theSon of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.

{24:31} And he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet,and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from oneend of heaven to the other. 

{24:32} Now learn a parable of the figtree; When his branch is yet tender, and putteth forth leaves, ye knowthat summer is nigh: 

{24:33} So likewise ye, when ye shall see allthese things, know that it is near, [even] at the doors. 

{24:34} VerilyI say unto you, This generation shall not pass, till all these thingsbe fulfilled. 

{24:35} Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my wordsshall not pass away.   

{24:36} But of that day and hour knoweth no [man,] no, not theangels of heaven, but my Father only. 

{24:37} But as the days of Noe[were,] so shall also the coming of the Son of man be. 

{24:38} For asin the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking,marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noe entered intothe ark, 

{24:39} And knew not until the flood came, and took them allaway; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be. 

{24:40} Then shalltwo be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the other left.

{24:41} Two [women shall be] grinding at the mill; the one shall betaken, and the other left.   

{24:42} Watch therefore: for ye know not what hour your Lord dothcome. 

{24:43} But know this, that if the goodman of the house had knownin what watch the thief would come, he would have watched, and wouldnot have suffered his house to be broken up. 

{24:44} Therefore be yealso ready: for in such an hour as ye think not the Son of man cometh.

{24:45} Who then is a faithful and wise servant, whom his lord hathmade ruler over his household, to give them meat in due season? 

{24:46}Blessed [is] that servant, whom his lord when he cometh shall find sodoing. 

{24:47} Verily I say unto you, That he shall make him ruler overall his goods. 

{24:48} But and if that evil servant shall say in hisheart, My lord delayeth his coming; 

{24:49} And shall begin to smite[his] fellowservants, and to eat and drink with the drunken; 

{24:50}The lord of that servant shall come in a day when he looketh not for[him,] and in an hour that he is not aware of, 

{24:51} And shall cuthim asunder, and appoint [him] his portion with the hypocrites: thereshall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.   

{25:1} Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins,which took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom. 

{25:2}And five of them were wise, and five [were] foolish. 

{25:3} They that[were] foolish took their lamps, and took no oil with them: 

{25:4} Butthe wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps. 

{25:5} While thebridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept. 

{25:6} And atmidnight there was a cry made, Behold, the bridegroom cometh; go ye outto meet him. 

{25:7} Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed theirlamps. 

{25:8} And the foolish said unto the wise, Give us of your oil;for our lamps are gone out. 

{25:9} But the wise answered, saying, [Notso;] lest there be not enough for us and you: but go ye rather to themthat sell, and buy for yourselves. 

{25:10} And while they went to buy,the bridegroom came; and they that were ready went in with him to themarriage: and the door was shut. 

{25:11} Afterward came also the othervirgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us. 

{25:12} But he answered andsaid, Verily I say unto you, I know you not. 

{25:13} Watch therefore,for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the Son of man cometh.   

{25:14} For [the kingdom of heaven is] as a man travelling into afar country, [who] called his own servants, and delivered unto them hisgoods. 

{25:15} And unto one he gave five talents, to another two, andto another one; to every man according to his several ability; andstraightway took his journey. 

{25:16} Then he that had received thefive talents went and traded with the same, and made [them] other fivetalents. 

{25:17} And likewise he that [had received] two, he alsogained other two. 

{25:18} But he that had received one went and diggedin the earth, and hid his lord's money. 

{25:19} After a long time thelord of those servants cometh, and reckoneth with them. 

{25:20} And sohe that had received five talents came and brought other five talents,saying, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me five talents: behold, I havegained beside them five talents more. 

{25:21} His lord said unto him,Well done, [thou] good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithfulover a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thouinto the joy of thy lord. 

{25:22} He also that had received two talentscame and said, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me two talents: behold, Ihave gained two other talents beside them. 

{25:23} His lord said untohim, Well done, good and faithful servant; thou hast been faithful overa few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou intothe joy of thy lord. 

{25:24} Then he which had received the one talentcame and said, Lord, I knew thee that thou art an hard man, reapingwhere thou hast not sown, and gathering where thou hast not strawed:

{25:25} And I was afraid, and went and hid thy talent in the earth: lo,[there] thou hast [that is] thine. 

{25:26} His lord answered and saidunto him, [Thou] wicked and slothful servant, thou knewest that I reapwhere I sowed not, and gather where I have not strawed: 

{25:27} Thououghtest therefore to have put my money to the exchangers, and [then]at my coming I should have received mine own with usury. 

{25:28} Taketherefore the talent from him, and give [it] unto him which hath tentalents. 

{25:29} For unto every one that hath shall be given, and heshall have abundance: but from him that hath not shall be taken awayeven that which he hath. 

{25:30} And cast ye the unprofitable servantinto outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.   

{25:31} When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all theholy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory:

{25:32} And before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shallseparate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth [his] sheep fromthe goats: 

{25:33} And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, butthe goats on the left. 

{25:34} Then shall the King say unto them on hisright hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom preparedfor you from the foundation of the world: 

{25:35} For I was an hungred,and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was astranger, and ye took me in: 

{25:36} Naked, and ye clothed me: I wassick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me. 

{25:37}Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee anhungred, and fed [thee?] or thirsty, and gave [thee] drink? 

{25:38}When saw we thee a stranger, and took [thee] in? or naked, and clothed[thee? ]

{25:39} Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came untothee? 

{25:40} And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I sayunto you, Inasmuch as ye have done [it] unto one of the least of thesemy brethren, ye have done [it] unto me. 

{25:41} Then shall he say alsounto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlastingfire, prepared for the devil and his angels: 

{25:42} For I was anhungred, and ye gave me no meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me nodrink: 

{25:43} I was a stranger, and ye took me not in: naked, and yeclothed me not: sick, and in prison, and ye visited me not. 

{25:44}Then shall they also answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee anhungred, or athirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison,and did not minister unto thee? 

{25:45} Then shall he answer them,saying, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did [it] not to one ofthe least of these, ye did [it] not to me. 

{25:46} And these shall goaway into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into life eternal.   

{26:1} And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished all thesesayings, he said unto his disciples, 

{26:2} Ye know that after two daysis [the feast of] the passover, and the Son of man is betrayed to becrucified. 

{26:3} Then assembled together the chief priests, and thescribes, and the elders of the people, unto the palace of the highpriest, who was called Caiaphas, 

{26:4} And consulted that they mighttake Jesus by subtilty, and kill [him. ]

{26:5} But they said, Not onthe feast [day,] lest there be an uproar among the people.   

{26:6} Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon theleper, 

{26:7} There came unto him a woman having an alabaster box ofvery precious ointment, and poured it on his head, as he sat [at meat.]

{26:8} But when his disciples saw [it,] they had indignation, saying,To what purpose [is] this waste? 

{26:9} For this ointment might havebeen sold for much, and given to the poor. 

{26:10} When Jesusunderstood [it,] he said unto them, Why trouble ye the woman? for shehath wrought a good work upon me. 

{26:11} For ye have the poor alwayswith you; but me ye have not always. 

{26:12} For in that she hathpoured this ointment on my body, she did [it] for my burial. 

{26:13}Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in thewhole world, [there] shall also this, that this woman hath done, betold for a memorial of her.   

{26:14} Then one of the twelve, called Judas Iscariot, went unto thechief priests, 

{26:15} And said [unto them,] What will ye give me, andI will deliver him unto you? And they covenanted with him for thirtypieces of silver. 

{26:16} And from that time he sought opportunity tobetray him.   

{26:17} Now the first [day] of the [feast of] unleavened bread thedisciples came to Jesus, saying unto him, Where wilt thou that weprepare for thee to eat the passover? 

{26:18} And he said, Go into thecity to such a man, and say unto him, The Master saith, My time is athand; I will keep the passover at thy house with my disciples. 

{26:19}And the disciples did as Jesus had appointed them; and they made readythe passover. 

{26:20} Now when the even was come, he sat down with thetwelve. 

{26:21} And as they did eat, he said, Verily I say unto you,that one of you shall betray me. 

{26:22} And they were exceedingsorrowful, and began every one of them to say unto him, Lord, is it I?

{26:23} And he answered and said, He that dippeth [his] hand with me inthe dish, the same shall betray me. 

{26:24} The Son of man goeth as itis written of him: but woe unto that man by whom the Son of man isbetrayed! it had been good for that man if he had not been born.

{26:25} Then Judas, which betrayed him, answered and said, Master, isit I? He said unto him, Thou hast said.   

{26:26} And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed [it,]and brake [it,] and gave [it] to the disciples, and said, Take, eat;this is my body. 

{26:27} And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave[it] to them, saying, Drink ye all of it; 

{26:28} For this is my bloodof the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins.

{26:29} But I say unto you, I will not drink henceforth of this fruitof the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father'skingdom. 

{26:30} And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into themount of Olives. 

{26:31} Then saith Jesus unto them, All ye shall beoffended because of me this night: for it is written, I will smite theshepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad. 

{26:32}But after I am risen again, I will go before you into Galilee. 

{26:33}Peter answered and said unto him, Though all [men] shall be offendedbecause of thee, [yet] will I never be offended. 

{26:34} Jesus saidunto him, Verily I say unto thee, That this night, before the cockcrow, thou shalt deny me thrice. 

{26:35} Peter said unto him, Though Ishould die with thee, yet will I not deny thee. Likewise also said allthe disciples.   

{26:36} Then cometh Jesus with them unto a place called Gethsemane,and saith unto the disciples, Sit ye here, while I go and pray yonder.

{26:37} And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, andbegan to be sorrowful and very heavy. 

{26:38} Then saith he unto them,My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death: tarry ye here, andwatch with me. 

{26:39} And he went a little farther, and fell on hisface, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cuppass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou [wilt. ]

{26:40}And he cometh unto the disciples, and findeth them asleep, and saithunto Peter, What, could ye not watch with me one hour? 

{26:41} Watchand pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed [is]willing, but the flesh [is] weak. 

{26:42} He went away again the secondtime, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if this cup may not pass awayfrom me, except I drink it, thy will be done. 

{26:43} And he came andfound them asleep again: for their eyes were heavy. 

{26:44} And he leftthem, and went away again, and prayed the third time, saying the samewords. 

{26:45} Then cometh he to his disciples, and saith unto them,Sleep on now, and take [your] rest: behold, the hour is at hand, andthe Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners. 

{26:46} Rise, letus be going: behold, he is at hand that doth betray me.   

{26:47} And while he yet spake, lo, Judas, one of the twelve, came,and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chiefpriests and elders of the people. 

{26:48} Now he that betrayed him gavethem a sign, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he: hold himfast. 

{26:49} And forthwith he came to Jesus, and said, Hail, master;and kissed him. 

{26:50} And Jesus said unto him, Friend, wherefore artthou come? Then came they, and laid hands on Jesus, and took him.

{26:51} And, behold, one of them which were with Jesus stretched out[his] hand, and drew his sword, and struck a servant of the highpriest's, and smote off his ear. 

{26:52} Then said Jesus unto him, Putup again thy sword into his place: for all they that take the swordshall perish with the sword. 

{26:53} Thinkest thou that I cannot nowpray to my Father, and he shall presently give me more than twelvelegions of angels? 

{26:54} But how then shall the scriptures befulfilled, that thus it must be? 

{26:55} In that same hour said Jesusto the multitudes, Are ye come out as against a thief with swords andstaves for to take me? I sat daily with you teaching in the temple, andye laid no hold on me. 

{26:56} But all this was done, that thescriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the disciplesforsook him, and fled.   

{26:57} And they that had laid hold on Jesus led [him] away toCaiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders wereassembled. 

{26:58} But Peter followed him afar off unto the highpriest's palace, and went in, and sat with the servants, to see theend. 

{26:59} Now the chief priests, and elders, and all the council,sought false witness against Jesus, to put him to death; 

{26:60} Butfound none: yea, though many false witnesses came, [yet] found theynone. At the last came two false witnesses, 

{26:61} And said, This[fellow] said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build itin three days. 

{26:62} And the high priest arose, and said unto him,Answerest thou nothing? what [is it which] these witness against thee?

{26:63} But Jesus held his peace. And the high priest answered and saidunto him, I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us whetherthou be the Christ, the Son of God. 

{26:64} Jesus saith unto him, Thouhast said: nevertheless I say unto you, Hereafter shall ye see the Sonof man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds ofheaven. 

{26:65} Then the high priest rent his clothes, saying, He hathspoken blasphemy; what further need have we of witnesses? behold, nowye have heard his blasphemy. 

{26:66} What think ye? They answered andsaid, He is guilty of death. 

{26:67} Then did they spit in his face,and buffeted him; and others smote [him] with the palms of their hands,

{26:68} Saying, Prophesy unto us, thou Christ, Who is he that smotethee?   

{26:69} Now Peter sat without in the palace: and a damsel came untohim, saying, Thou also wast with Jesus of Galilee. 

{26:70} But hedenied before [them] all, saying, I know not what thou sayest. 

{26:71}And when he was gone out into the porch, another [maid] saw him, andsaid unto them that were there, This [fellow] was also with Jesus ofNazareth. 

{26:72} And again he denied with an oath, I do not know theman. 

{26:73} And after a while came unto [him] they that stood by, andsaid to Peter, Surely thou also art [one] of them; for thy speechbewrayeth thee. 

{26:74} Then began he to curse and to swear, [saying,]I know not the man. And immediately the cock crew. 

{26:75} And Peterremembered the word of Jesus, which said unto him, Before the cockcrow, thou shalt deny me thrice. And he went out, and wept bitterly.   

{27:1} When the morning was come, all the chief priests and eldersof the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death: 

{27:2}And when they had bound him, they led [him] away, and delivered him toPontius Pilate the governor.   

{27:3} Then Judas, which had betrayeth him, when he saw that he wascondemned, repented himself, and brought again the thirty pieces ofsilver to the chief priests and elders, 

{27:4} Saying, I have sinned inthat I have betrayed the innocent blood. And they said, What [is that]to us? see thou [to that. ]

{27:5} And he cast down the pieces of silverin the temple, and departed, and went and hanged himself. 

{27:6} Andthe chief priests took the silver pieces, and said, It is not lawfulfor to put them into the treasury, because it is the price of blood.

{27:7} And they took counsel, and bought with them the potter's field,to bury strangers in. 

{27:8} Wherefore that field was called, The fieldof blood, unto this day. 

{27:9} Then was fulfilled that which wasspoken by Jeremy the prophet, saying, And they took the thirty piecesof silver, the price of him that was valued, whom they of the childrenof Israel did value; 

{27:10} And gave them for the potter's field, asthe Lord appointed me. 

{27:11} And Jesus stood before the governor: andthe governor asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? AndJesus said unto him, Thou sayest. 

{27:12} And when he was accused ofthe chief priests and elders, he answered nothing. 

{27:13} Then saidPilate unto him, Hearest thou not how many things they witness againstthee? 

{27:14} And he answered him to never a word; insomuch that thegovernor marvelled greatly. 

{27:15} Now at [that] feast the governorwas wont to release unto the people a prisoner, whom they would.

{27:16} And they had then a notable prisoner, called Barabbas. 

{27:17}Therefore when they were gathered together, Pilate said unto them, Whomwill ye that I release unto you? Barabbas, or Jesus which is calledChrist? 

{27:18} For he knew that for envy they had delivered him.   

{27:19} When he was set down on the judgment seat, his wife sentunto him, saying, Have thou nothing to do with that just man: for Ihave suffered many things this day in a dream because of him. 

{27:20}But the chief priests and elders persuaded the multitude that theyshould ask Barabbas, and destroy Jesus. 

{27:21} The governor answeredand said unto them, Whether of the twain will ye that I release untoyou? They said, Barabbas. 

{27:22} Pilate saith unto them, What shall Ido then with Jesus which is called Christ? [They] all say unto him, Lethim be crucified. 

{27:23} And the governor said, Why, what evil hath hedone? But they cried out the more, saying, Let him be crucified.   

{27:24} When Pilate saw that he could prevail nothing, but [that]rather a tumult was made, he took water, and washed [his] hands beforethe multitude, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this just person:see ye [to it. ]

{27:25} Then answered all the people, and said, Hisblood [be] on us, and on our children.   

{27:26} Then released he Barabbas unto them: and when he hadscourged Jesus, he delivered [him] to be crucified. 

{27:27} Then thesoldiers of the governor took Jesus into the common hall, and gatheredunto him the whole band [of soldiers. ]

{27:28} And they stripped him,and put on him a scarlet robe.   

{27:29} And when they had platted a crown of thorns, they put [it]upon his head, and a reed in his right hand: and they bowed the kneebefore him, and mocked him, saying, Hail, King of the Jews! 

{27:30} Andthey spit upon him, and took the reed, and smote him on the head.

{27:31} And after that they had mocked him, they took the robe off fromhim, and put his own raiment on him, and led him away to crucify [him.]

{27:32} And as they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon byname: him they compelled to bear his cross. 

{27:33} And when they werecome unto a place called Golgotha, that is to say, a place of a skull,   

{27:34} They gave him vinegar to drink mingled with gall: and whenhe had tasted [thereof,] he would not drink. 

{27:35} And they crucifiedhim, and parted his garments, casting lots: that it might be fulfilledwhich was spoken by the prophet, They parted my garments among them,and upon my vesture did they cast lots. 

{27:36} And sitting down theywatched him there; 

{27:37} And set up over his head his accusationwritten, THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS. 

{27:38} Then were theretwo thieves crucified with him, one on the right hand, and another onthe left.   

{27:39} And they that passed by reviled him, wagging their heads,

{27:40} And saying, Thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest [it]in three days, save thyself. If thou be the Son of God, come down fromthe cross. 

{27:41} Likewise also the chief priests mocking [him,] withthe scribes and elders, said, 

{27:42} He saved others; himself hecannot save. If he be the King of Israel, let him now come down fromthe cross, and we will believe him. 

{27:43} He trusted in God; let himdeliver him now, if he will have him: for he said, I am the Son of God.

{27:44} The thieves also, which were crucified with him, cast the samein his teeth. 

{27:45} Now from the sixth hour there was darkness overall the land unto the ninth hour. 

{27:46} And about the ninth hourJesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? thatis to say, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? 

{27:47} Some ofthem that stood there, when they heard [that,] said, This [man] callethfor Elias. 

{27:48} And straightway one of them ran, and took a spunge,and filled [it] with vinegar, and put [it] on a reed, and gave him todrink. 

{27:49} The rest said, Let be, let us see whether Elias willcome to save him.   

{27:50} Jesus, when he had cried again with a loud voice, yielded upthe ghost. 

{27:51} And, behold, the veil of the temple was rent intwain from the top to the bottom; and the earth did quake, and therocks rent; 

{27:52} And the graves were opened; and many bodies of thesaints which slept arose, 

{27:53} And came out of the graves after hisresurrection, and went into the holy city, and appeared unto many.

{27:54} Now when the centurion, and they that were with him, watchingJesus, saw the earthquake, and those things that were done, they fearedgreatly, saying, Truly this was the Son of God. 

{27:55} And many womenwere there beholding afar off, which followed Jesus from Galilee,ministering unto him: 

{27:56} Among which was Mary Magdalene, and Marythe mother of James and Joses, and the mother of Zebedee's children.

{27:57} When the even was come, there came a rich man of Arimathaea,named Joseph, who also himself was Jesus' disciple: 

{27:58} He went toPilate, and begged the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded the body tobe delivered. 

{27:59} And when Joseph had taken the body, he wrapped itin a clean linen cloth, 

{27:60} And laid it in his own new tomb, whichhe had hewn out in the rock: and he rolled a great stone to the door ofthe sepulchre, and departed. 

{27:61} And there was Mary Magdalene, andthe other Mary, sitting over against the sepulchre.   

{27:62} Now the next day, that followed the day of the preparation,the chief priests and Pharisees came together unto Pilate, 

{27:63}Saying, Sir, we remember that that deceiver said, while he was yetalive, After three days I will rise again. 

{27:64} Command thereforethat the sepulchre be made sure until the third day, lest his disciplescome by night, and steal him away, and say unto the people, He is risenfrom the dead: so the last error shall be worse than the first. 

{27:65}Pilate said unto them, Ye have a watch: go your way, make [it] as sureas ye can. 

{27:66} So they went, and made the sepulchre sure, sealingthe stone, and setting a watch.   

{28:1} In the end of the sabbath, as it began to dawn toward thefirst [day] of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to seethe sepulchre. 

{28:2} And, behold, there was a great earthquake: forthe angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled backthe stone from the door, and sat upon it. 

{28:3} His countenance waslike lightning, and his raiment white as snow: 

{28:4} And for fear ofhim the keepers did shake, and became as dead [men. ]

{28:5} And theangel answered and said unto the women, Fear not ye: for I know that yeseek Jesus, which was crucified. 

{28:6} He is not here: for he isrisen, as he said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay. 

{28:7} Andgo quickly, and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead; and,behold, he goeth before you into Galilee; there shall ye see him: lo, Ihave told you. 

{28:8} And they departed quickly from the sepulchre withfear and great joy; and did run to bring his disciples word.   

{28:9} And as they went to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus metthem, saying, All hail. And they came and held him by the feet, andworshipped him. 

{28:10} Then said Jesus unto them, Be not afraid: gotell my brethren that they go into Galilee, and there shall they see me.   

{28:11} Now when they were going, behold, some of the watch cameinto the city, and shewed unto the chief priests all the things thatwere done. 

{28:12} And when they were assembled with the elders, andhad taken counsel, they gave large money unto the soldiers, 

{28:13}Saying, Say ye, His disciples came by night, and stole him [away] whilewe slept. 

{28:14} And if this come to the governor's ears, we willpersuade him, and secure you. 

{28:15} So they took the money, and didas they were taught: and this saying is commonly reported among theJews until this day.   

{28:16} Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, into amountain where Jesus had appointed them. 

{28:17} And when they saw him,they worshipped him: but some doubted. 

{28:18} And Jesus came and spakeunto them, saying, All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth.

{28:19} Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in thename of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: 

{28:20}Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you:and, lo, I am with you alway, [even] unto the end of the world. Amen.
