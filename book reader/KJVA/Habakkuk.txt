{Habakkuk   

{1:1} The burden which Habakkuk the prophet did see. 

{1:2} O LORD,how long shall I cry, and thou wilt not hear! [even] cry out unto thee[of] violence, and thou wilt not save! 

{1:3} Why dost thou shew meiniquity, and cause [me] to behold grievance? for spoiling and violence[are] before me: and there are [that] raise up strife and contention.

{1:4} Therefore the law is slacked, and judgment doth never go forth:for the wicked doth compass about the righteous; therefore wrongjudgment proceedeth.   

{1:5} Behold ye among the heathen, and regard, and wondermarvellously: for [I] will work a work in your days, [which] ye willnot believe, though it be told [you. ]

{1:6} For, lo, I raise up theChaldeans, [that] bitter and hasty nation, which shall march throughthe breadth of the land, to possess the dwellingplaces [that are] nottheirs. 

{1:7} They [are] terrible and dreadful: their judgment andtheir dignity shall proceed of themselves. 

{1:8} Their horses also areswifter than the leopards, and are more fierce than the evening wolves:and their horsemen shall spread themselves, and their horsemen shallcome from far; they shall fly as the eagle [that] hasteth to eat. 

{1:9}They shall come all for violence: their faces shall sup up [as] theeast wind, and they shall gather the captivity as the sand. 

{1:10} Andthey shall scoff at the kings, and the princes shall be a scorn untothem: they shall deride every strong hold; for they shall heap dust,and take it. 

{1:11} Then shall [his] mind change, and he shall passover, and offend, [imputing] this his power unto his god.   

{1:12} [Art] thou not from everlasting, O LORD my God, mine HolyOne? we shall not die. O LORD, thou hast ordained them for judgment;and, O mighty God, thou hast established them for correction. 

{1:13}[Thou art] of purer eyes than to behold evil, and canst not look oniniquity: wherefore lookest thou upon them that deal treacherously,[and] holdest thy tongue when the wicked devoureth [the man that is]more righteous than he? 

{1:14} And makest men as the fishes of the sea,as the creeping things, [that have] no ruler over them? 

{1:15} Theytake up all of them with the angle, they catch them in their net, andgather them in their drag: therefore they rejoice and are glad. 

{1:16}Therefore they sacrifice unto their net, and burn incense unto theirdrag; because by them their portion [is] fat, and their meat plenteous.

{1:17} Shall they therefore empty their net, and not spare continuallyto slay the nations?   

{2:1} I will stand upon my watch, and set me upon the tower, andwill watch to see what he will say unto me, and what I shall answerwhen I am reproved. 

{2:2} And the LORD answered me, and said, Write thevision, and make [it] plain upon tables, that he may run that readethit. 

{2:3} For the vision [is] yet for an appointed time, but at the endit shall speak, and not lie: though it tarry, wait for it; because itwill surely come, it will not tarry. 

{2:4} Behold, his soul [which] islifted up is not upright in him: but the just shall live by his faith.   

{2:5} Yea also, because he transgresseth by wine, [he is] a proudman, neither keepeth at home, who enlargeth his desire as hell, and[is] as death, and cannot be satisfied, but gathereth unto him allnations, and heapeth unto him all people: 

{2:6} Shall not all thesetake up a parable against him, and a taunting proverb against him, andsay, Woe to him that increaseth [that which is] not his! how long? andto him that ladeth himself with thick clay! 

{2:7} Shall they not riseup suddenly that shall bite thee, and awake that shall vex thee, andthou shalt be for booties unto them? 

{2:8} Because thou hast spoiledmany nations, all the remnant of the people shall spoil thee; becauseof men's blood, and [for] the violence of the land, of the city, and ofall that dwell therein.   

{2:9} Woe to him that coveteth an evil covetousness to his house,that he may set his nest on high, that he may be delivered from thepower of evil! 

{2:10} Thou hast consulted shame to thy house by cuttingoff many people, and hast sinned [against] thy soul. 

{2:11} For thestone shall cry out of the wall, and the beam out of the timber shallanswer it.   

{2:12} Woe to him that buildeth a town with blood, and stablisheth acity by iniquity! 

{2:13} Behold, [is it] not of the LORD of hosts thatthe people shall labour in the very fire, and the people shall wearythemselves for very vanity? 

{2:14} For the earth shall be filled withthe knowledge of the glory of the LORD, as the waters cover the sea.   

{2:15} Woe unto him that giveth his neighbour drink, that puttestthy bottle to [him,] and makest [him] drunken also, that thou mayestlook on their nakedness! 

{2:16} Thou art filled with shame for glory:drink thou also, and let thy foreskin be uncovered: the cup of theLORD'S right hand shall be turned unto thee, and shameful spewing[shall be] on thy glory. 

{2:17} For the violence of Lebanon shall coverthee, and the spoil of beasts, [which] made them afraid, because ofmen's blood, and for the violence of the land, of the city, and of allthat dwell therein.   

{2:18} What profiteth the graven image that the maker thereof hathgraven it; the molten image, and a teacher of lies, that the maker ofhis work trusteth therein, to make dumb idols? 

{2:19} Woe unto him thatsaith to the wood, Awake; to the dumb stone, Arise, it shall teach!Behold, it [is] laid over with gold and silver, and [there is] nobreath at all in the midst of it. 

{2:20} But the LORD [is] in his holytemple: let all the earth keep silence before him.   

{3:1} A prayer of Habakkuk the prophet upon Shigionoth. 

{3:2} OLORD, I have heard thy speech, [and] was afraid: O LORD, revive thywork in the midst of the years, in the midst of the years make known;in wrath remember mercy. 

{3:3} God came from Teman, and the Holy Onefrom mount Paran. Selah. His glory covered the heavens, and the earthwas full of his praise. 

{3:4} And [his] brightness was as the light; hehad horns [coming] out of his hand: and there [was] the hiding of hispower. 

{3:5} Before him went the pestilence, and burning coals wentforth at his feet. 

{3:6} He stood, and measured the earth: he beheld,and drove asunder the nations; and the everlasting mountains werescattered, the perpetual hills did bow: his ways [are] everlasting.

{3:7} I saw the tents of Cushan in affliction: [and] the curtains ofthe land of Midian did tremble. 

{3:8} Was the LORD displeased againstthe rivers? [was] thine anger against the rivers? [was] thy wrathagainst the sea, that thou didst ride upon thine horses [and] thychariots of salvation? 

{3:9} Thy bow was made quite naked, [according]to the oaths of the tribes, [even thy] word. Selah. Thou didst cleavethe earth with rivers. 

{3:10} The mountains saw thee, [and] theytrembled: the overflowing of the water passed by: the deep uttered hisvoice, [and] lifted up his hands on high. 

{3:11} The sun [and] moonstood still in their habitation: at the light of thine arrows theywent, [and] at the shining of thy glittering spear. 

{3:12} Thou didstmarch through the land in indignation, thou didst thresh the heathen inanger. 

{3:13} Thou wentest forth for the salvation of thy people,[even] for salvation with thine anointed; thou woundedst the head outof the house of the wicked, by discovering the foundation unto theneck. Selah. 

{3:14} Thou didst strike through with his staves the headof his villages: they came out as a whirlwind to scatter me: theirrejoicing [was] as to devour the poor secretly. 

{3:15} Thou didst walkthrough the sea with thine horses, [through] the heap of great waters.

{3:16} When I heard, my belly trembled; my lips quivered at the voice:rottenness entered into my bones, and I trembled in myself, that Imight rest in the day of trouble: when he cometh up unto the people, hewill invade them with his troops.   

{3:17} Although the fig tree shall not blossom, neither [shall]fruit [be] in the vines; the labour of the olive shall fail, and thefields shall yield no meat; the flock shall be cut off from the fold,and [there shall be] no herd in the stalls: 

{3:18} Yet I will rejoicein the LORD, I will joy in the God of my salvation. 

{3:19} The LORD God[is] my strength, and he will make my feet like hinds' [feet,] and hewill make me to walk upon mine high places. To the chief singer on mystringed instruments.
