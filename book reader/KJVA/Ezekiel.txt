{The Book of the Prophet Ezekiel   

{1:1} Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year, in the fourth[month,] in the fifth [day] of the month, as I [was] among the captivesby the river of Chebar, [that] the heavens were opened, and I sawvisions of God. 

{1:2} In the fifth [day] of the month, which [was] thefifth year of king Jehoiachin's captivity, 

{1:3} The word of the LORDcame expressly unto Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, in the land ofthe Chaldeans by the river Chebar; and the hand of the LORD was thereupon him. 

{1:4} And I looked, and, behold, a whirlwind came out of thenorth, a great cloud, and a fire infolding itself, and a brightness[was] about it, and out of the midst thereof as the colour of amber,out of the midst of the fire. 

{1:5} Also out of the midst thereof[came] the likeness of four living creatures. And this [was] theirappearance; they had the likeness of a man. 

{1:6} And every one hadfour faces, and every one had four wings. 

{1:7} And their feet [were]straight feet; and the sole of their feet [was] like the sole of acalf's foot: and they sparkled like the colour of burnished brass.

{1:8} And [they had] the hands of a man under their wings on their foursides; and they four had their faces and their wings. 

{1:9} Their wings[were] joined one to another; they turned not when they went; they wentevery one straight forward. 

{1:10} As for the likeness of their faces,they four had the face of a man, and the face of a lion, on the rightside: and they four had the face of an ox on the left side; they fouralso had the face of an eagle. 

{1:11} Thus [were] their faces: andtheir wings [were] stretched upward; two [wings] of every one [were]joined one to another, and two covered their bodies. 

{1:12} And theywent every one straight forward: whither the spirit was to go, theywent; [and] they turned not when they went. 

{1:13} As for the likenessof the living creatures, their appearance [was] like burning coals offire, [and] like the appearance of lamps: it went up and down among theliving creatures; and the fire was bright, and out of the fire wentforth lightning. 

{1:14} And the living creatures ran and returned asthe appearance of a flash of lightning.   

{1:15} Now as I beheld the living creatures, behold one wheel uponthe earth by the living creatures, with his four faces. 

{1:16} Theappearance of the wheels and their work [was] like unto the colour of aberyl: and they four had one likeness: and their appearance and theirwork was as it were a wheel in the middle of a wheel. 

{1:17} When theywent, they went upon their four sides: [and] they turned not when theywent. 

{1:18} As for their rings, they were so high that they weredreadful; and their rings [were] full of eyes round about them four.

{1:19} And when the living creatures went, the wheels went by them: andwhen the living creatures were lifted up from the earth, the wheelswere lifted up. 

{1:20} Whithersoever the spirit was to go, they went,thither [was their] spirit to go; and the wheels were lifted up overagainst them: for the spirit of the living creature [was] in thewheels. 

{1:21} When those went, [these] went; and when those stood,[these] stood; and when those were lifted up from the earth, the wheelswere lifted up over against them: for the spirit of the living creature[was] in the wheels. 

{1:22} And the likeness of the firmament upon theheads of the living creature [was] as the colour of the terriblecrystal, stretched forth over their heads above. 

{1:23} And under thefirmament [were] their wings straight, the one toward the other: everyone had two, which covered on this side, and every one had two, whichcovered on that side, their bodies. 

{1:24} And when they went, I heardthe noise of their wings, like the noise of great waters, as the voiceof the Almighty, the voice of speech, as the noise of an host: whenthey stood, they let down their wings. 

{1:25} And there was a voicefrom the firmament that [was] over their heads, when they stood, andhad let down their wings.   

{1:26} And above the firmament that [was] over their heads [was] thelikeness of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire stone: and uponthe likeness of the throne [was] the likeness as the appearance of aman above upon it. 

{1:27} And I saw as the colour of amber, as theappearance of fire round about within it, from the appearance of hisloins even upward, and from the appearance of his loins even downward,I saw as it were the appearance of fire, and it had brightness roundabout. 

{1:28} As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in theday of rain, so [was] the appearance of the brightness round about.This [was] the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the LORD. Andwhen I saw [it,] I fell upon my face, and I heard a voice of one thatspake.   

{2:1} And he said unto me, Son of man, stand upon thy feet, and Iwill speak unto thee. 

{2:2} And the spirit entered into me when hespake unto me, and set me upon my feet, that I heard him that spakeunto me. 

{2:3} And he said unto me, Son of man, I send thee to thechildren of Israel, to a rebellious nation that hath rebelled againstme: they and their fathers have transgressed against me, [even] untothis very day. 

{2:4} For [they are] impudent children and stiffhearted.I do send thee unto them; and thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith theLord GOD. 

{2:5} And they, whether they will hear, or whether they willforbear, (for they [are] a rebellious house,) yet shall know that therehath been a prophet among them.   

{2:6} And thou, son of man, be not afraid of them, neither be afraidof their words, though briers and thorns [be] with thee, and thou dostdwell among scorpions: be not afraid of their words, nor be dismayed attheir looks, though they [be] a rebellious house. 

{2:7} And thou shaltspeak my words unto them, whether they will hear, or whether they willforbear: for they [are] most rebellious. 

{2:8} But thou, son of man,hear what I say unto thee; Be not thou rebellious like that rebellioushouse: open thy mouth, and eat that I give thee.   

{2:9} And when I looked, behold, an hand [was] sent unto me; and,lo, a roll of a book [was] therein; 

{2:10} And he spread it before me;and it [was] written within and without: and [there was] writtentherein lamentations, and mourning, and woe.   

{3:1} Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, eat that thou findest;eat this roll, and go speak unto the house of Israel. 

{3:2} So I openedmy mouth, and he caused me to eat that roll. 

{3:3} And he said unto me,Son of man, cause thy belly to eat, and fill thy bowels with this rollthat I give thee. Then did I eat [it;] and it was in my mouth as honeyfor sweetness.   

{3:4} And he said unto me, Son of man, go, get thee unto the houseof Israel, and speak with my words unto them. 

{3:5} For thou [art] notsent to a people of a strange speech and of an hard language, [but] tothe house of Israel; 

{3:6} Not to many people of a strange speech andof an hard language, whose words thou canst not understand. Surely, hadI sent thee to them, they would have hearkened unto thee. 

{3:7} But thehouse of Israel will not hearken unto thee; for they will not hearkenunto me: for all the house of Israel [are] impudent and hardhearted.

{3:8} Behold, I have made thy face strong against their faces, and thyforehead strong against their foreheads. 

{3:9} As an adamant harderthan flint have I made thy forehead: fear them not, neither be dismayedat their looks, though they [be] a rebellious house. 

{3:10} Moreover hesaid unto me, Son of man, all my words that I shall speak unto theereceive in thine heart, and hear with thine ears. 

{3:11} And go, getthee to them of the captivity, unto the children of thy people, andspeak unto them, and tell them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; whether theywill hear, or whether they will forbear. 

{3:12} Then the spirit took meup, and I heard behind me a voice of a great rushing, [saying,] Blessed[be] the glory of the LORD from his place. 

{3:13} [I heard] also thenoise of the wings of the living creatures that touched one another,and the noise of the wheels over against them, and a noise of a greatrushing. 

{3:14} So the spirit lifted me up, and took me away, and Iwent in bitterness, in the heat of my spirit; but the hand of the LORDwas strong upon me.   

{3:15} Then I came to them of the captivity at Tel-abib, that dweltby the river of Chebar, and I sat where they sat, and remained thereastonished among them seven days. 

{3:16} And it came to pass at the endof seven days, that the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 

{3:17}Son of man, I have made thee a watchman unto the house of Israel:therefore hear the word at my mouth, and give them warning from me.

{3:18} When I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; and thougivest him not warning, nor speakest to warn the wicked from his wickedway, to save his life; the same wicked [man] shall die in his iniquity;but his blood will I require at thine hand. 

{3:19} Yet if thou warn thewicked, and he turn not from his wickedness, nor from his wicked way,he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul. 

{3:20}Again, When a righteous [man] doth turn from his righteousness, andcommit iniquity, and I lay a stumblingblock before him, he shall die:because thou hast not given him warning, he shall die in his sin, andhis righteousness which he hath done shall not be remembered; but hisblood will I require at thine hand. 

{3:21} Nevertheless if thou warnthe righteous [man,] that the righteous sin not, and he doth not sin,he shall surely live, because he is warned; also thou hast deliveredthy soul.   

{3:22} And the hand of the LORD was there upon me; and he said untome, Arise, go forth into the plain, and I will there talk with thee.

{3:23} Then I arose, and went forth into the plain: and, behold, theglory of the LORD stood there, as the glory which I saw by the river ofChebar: and I fell on my face. 

{3:24} Then the spirit entered into me,and set me upon my feet, and spake with me, and said unto me, Go, shutthyself within thine house. 

{3:25} But thou, O son of man, behold, theyshall put bands upon thee, and shall bind thee with them, and thoushalt not go out among them: 

{3:26} And I will make thy tongue cleaveto the roof of thy mouth, that thou shalt be dumb, and shalt not be tothem a reprover: for they [are] a rebellious house. 

{3:27} But when Ispeak with thee, I will open thy mouth, and thou shalt say unto them,Thus saith the Lord GOD; He that heareth, let him hear; and he thatforbeareth, let him forbear: for they [are] a rebellious house.   

{4:1} Thou also, son of man, take thee a tile, and lay it beforethee, and pourtray upon it the city, [even] Jerusalem: 

{4:2} And laysiege against it, and build a fort against it, and cast a mount againstit; set the camp also against it, and set [battering] rams against itround about. 

{4:3} Moreover take thou unto thee an iron pan, and set itfor a wall of iron between thee and the city: and set thy face againstit, and it shall be besieged, and thou shalt lay siege against it. This[shall be] a sign to the house of Israel. 

{4:4} Lie thou also upon thyleft side, and lay the iniquity of the house of Israel upon it:[according] to the number of the days that thou shalt lie upon it thoushalt bear their iniquity. 

{4:5} For I have laid upon thee the years oftheir iniquity, according to the number of the days, three hundred andninety days: so shalt thou bear the iniquity of the house of Israel.

{4:6} And when thou hast accomplished them, lie again on thy rightside, and thou shalt bear the iniquity of the house of Judah fortydays: I have appointed thee each day for a year. 

{4:7} Therefore thoushalt set thy face toward the siege of Jerusalem, and thine arm [shallbe] uncovered, and thou shalt prophesy against it. 

{4:8} And, behold, Iwill lay bands upon thee, and thou shalt not turn thee from one side toanother, till thou hast ended the days of thy siege.   

{4:9} Take thou also unto thee wheat, and barley, and beans, andlentiles, and millet, and fitches, and put them in one vessel, and makethee bread thereof, [according] to the number of the days that thoushalt lie upon thy side, three hundred and ninety days shalt thou eatthereof. 

{4:10} And thy meat which thou shalt eat [shall be] by weight,twenty shekels a day: from time to time shalt thou eat it. 

{4:11} Thoushalt drink also water by measure, the sixth part of an hin: from timeto time shalt thou drink. 

{4:12} And thou shalt eat it [as] barleycakes, and thou shalt bake it with dung that cometh out of man, intheir sight. 

{4:13} And the LORD said, Even thus shall the children ofIsrael eat their defiled bread among the Gentiles, whither I will drivethem. 

{4:14} Then said I, Ah Lord GOD! behold, my soul hath not beenpolluted: for from my youth up even till now have I not eaten of thatwhich dieth of itself, or is torn in pieces; neither came thereabominable flesh into my mouth. 

{4:15} Then he said unto me, Lo, I havegiven thee cow's dung for man's dung, and thou shalt prepare thy breadtherewith. 

{4:16} Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, behold, I willbreak the staff of bread in Jerusalem: and they shall eat bread byweight, and with care; and they shall drink water by measure, and withastonishment: 

{4:17} That they may want bread and water, and beastonied one with another, and consume away for their iniquity.   

{5:1} And thou, son of man, take thee a sharp knife, take thee abarber's razor, and cause [it] to pass upon thine head and upon thybeard: then take thee balances to weigh, and divide the [hair. ]

{5:2}Thou shalt burn with fire a third part in the midst of the city, whenthe days of the siege are fulfilled: and thou shalt take a third part,[and] smite about it with a knife: and a third part thou shalt scatterin the wind; and I will draw out a sword after them. 

{5:3} Thou shaltalso take thereof a few in number, and bind them in thy skirts. 

{5:4}Then take of them again, and cast them into the midst of the fire, andburn them in the fire; [for] thereof shall a fire come forth into allthe house of Israel.   

{5:5} Thus saith the Lord GOD; This [is] Jerusalem: I have set it inthe midst of the nations and countries [that are] round about her.

{5:6} And she hath changed my judgments into wickedness more than thenations, and my statutes more than the countries that [are] round abouther: for they have refused my judgments and my statutes, they have notwalked in them. 

{5:7} Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because yemultiplied more than the nations that [are] round about you, [and] havenot walked in my statutes, neither have kept my judgments, neither havedone according to the judgments of the nations that [are] round aboutyou; 

{5:8} Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I, even I, [am]against thee, and will execute judgments in the midst of thee in thesight of the nations. 

{5:9} And I will do in thee that which I have notdone, and whereunto I will not do any more the like, because of allthine abominations. 

{5:10} Therefore the fathers shall eat the sons inthe midst of thee, and the sons shall eat their fathers; and I willexecute judgments in thee, and the whole remnant of thee will I scatterinto all the winds. 

{5:11} Wherefore, [as] I live, saith the Lord GOD;Surely, because thou hast defiled my sanctuary with all thy detestablethings, and with all thine abominations, therefore will I also diminish[thee;] neither shall mine eye spare, neither will I have any pity.   

{5:12} A third part of thee shall die with the pestilence, and withfamine shall they be consumed in the midst of thee: and a third partshall fall by the sword round about thee and I will scatter a thirdpart into all the winds, and I will draw out a sword after them. 

{5:13}Thus shall mine anger be accomplished, and I will cause my fury to restupon them, and I will be comforted: and they shall know that I the LORDhave spoken [it] in my zeal, when I have accomplished my fury in them.

{5:14} Moreover I will make thee waste, and a reproach among thenations that [are] round about thee, in the sight of all that pass by.

{5:15} So it shall be a reproach and a taunt, an instruction and anastonishment unto the nations that [are] round about thee, when I shallexecute judgments in thee in anger and in fury and in furious rebukes.I the LORD have spoken [it. ]

{5:16} When I shall send upon them theevil arrows of famine, which shall be for [their] destruction, [and]which I will send to destroy you: and I will increase the famine uponyou, and will break your staff of bread: 

{5:17} So will I send upon youfamine and evil beasts, and they shall bereave thee; and pestilence andblood shall pass through thee; and I will bring the sword upon thee. Ithe LORD have spoken [it.]   

{6:1} And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 

{6:2} Son ofman, set thy face toward the mountains of Israel, and prophesy againstthem, 

{6:3} And say, Ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the LordGOD; Thus saith the Lord GOD to the mountains, and to the hills, to therivers, and to the valleys; Behold, I, [even] I, will bring a swordupon you, and I will destroy your high places. 

{6:4} And your altarsshall be desolate, and your images shall be broken: and I will castdown your slain [men] before your idols. 

{6:5} And I will lay the deadcarcases of the children of Israel before their idols; and I willscatter your bones round about your altars. 

{6:6} In all yourdwellingplaces the cities shall be laid waste, and the high placesshall be desolate; that your altars may be laid waste and madedesolate, and your idols may be broken and cease, and your images maybe cut down, and your works may be abolished. 

{6:7} And the slain shallfall in the midst of you, and ye shall know that I [am] the LORD.   

{6:8} Yet will I leave a remnant, that ye may have [some] that shallescape the sword among the nations, when ye shall be scattered throughthe countries. 

{6:9} And they that escape of you shall remember meamong the nations whither they shall be carried captives, because I ambroken with their whorish heart, which hath departed from me, and withtheir eyes, which go a whoring after their idols: and they shall lothethemselves for the evils which they have committed in all theirabominations. 

{6:10} And they shall know that I [am] the LORD, [andthat] I have not said in vain that I would do this evil unto them.   

{6:11} Thus saith the Lord GOD; Smite with thine hand, and stampwith thy foot, and say, Alas for all the evil abominations of the houseof Israel! for they shall fall by the sword, by the famine, and by thepestilence. 

{6:12} He that is far off shall die of the pestilence; andhe that is near shall fall by the sword; and he that remaineth and isbesieged shall die by the famine: thus will I accomplish my fury uponthem. 

{6:13} Then shall ye know that I [am] the LORD, when their slain[men] shall be among their idols round about their altars, upon everyhigh hill, in all the tops of the mountains, and under every greentree, and under every thick oak, the place where they did offer sweetsavour to all their idols. 

{6:14} So will I stretch out my hand uponthem, and make the land desolate, yea, more desolate than thewilderness toward Diblath, in all their habitations: and they shallknow that I [am] the LORD.   

{7:1} Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 

{7:2}Also, thou son of man, thus saith the Lord GOD unto the land of Israel;An end, the end is come upon the four corners of the land. 

{7:3} Now[is] the end [come] upon thee, and I will send mine anger upon thee,and will judge thee according to thy ways, and will recompense uponthee all thine abominations. 

{7:4} And mine eye shall not spare thee,neither will I have pity: but I will recompense thy ways upon thee, andthine abominations shall be in the midst of thee: and ye shall knowthat I [am] the LORD. 

{7:5} Thus saith the Lord GOD; An evil, an onlyevil, behold, is come. 

{7:6} An end is come, the end is come: itwatcheth for thee; behold, it is come. 

{7:7} The morning is come untothee, O thou that dwellest in the land: the time is come, the day oftrouble [is] near, and not the sounding again of the mountains. 

{7:8}Now will I shortly pour out my fury upon thee, and accomplish mineanger upon thee: and I will judge thee according to thy ways, and willrecompense thee for all thine abominations. 

{7:9} And mine eye shallnot spare, neither will I have pity: I will recompense thee accordingto thy ways and thine abominations [that] are in the midst of thee; andye shall know that I [am] the LORD that smiteth. 

{7:10} Behold the day,behold, it is come: the morning is gone forth; the rod hath blossomed,pride hath budded. 

{7:11} Violence is risen up into a rod ofwickedness: none of them [shall remain,] nor of their multitude, nor ofany of theirs: neither [shall there be] wailing for them. 

{7:12} Thetime is come, the day draweth near: let not the buyer rejoice, nor theseller mourn: for wrath [is] upon all the multitude thereof. 

{7:13} Forthe seller shall not return to that which is sold, although they wereyet alive: for the vision [is] touching the whole multitude thereof,[which] shall not return; neither shall any strengthen himself in theiniquity of his life. 

{7:14} They have blown the trumpet, even to makeall ready; but none goeth to the battle: for my wrath [is] upon all themultitude thereof. 

{7:15} The sword [is] without, and the pestilenceand the famine within: he that [is] in the field shall die with thesword; and he that [is] in the city, famine and pestilence shall devourhim.   

{7:16} But they that escape of them shall escape, and shall be onthe mountains like doves of the valleys, all of them mourning, everyone for his iniquity. 

{7:17} All hands shall be feeble, and all kneesshall be weak [as] water. 

{7:18} They shall also gird [themselves] withsackcloth, and horror shall cover them; and shame [shall be] upon allfaces, and baldness upon all their heads. 

{7:19} They shall cast theirsilver in the streets, and their gold shall be removed: their silverand their gold shall not be able to deliver them in the day of thewrath of the LORD: they shall not satisfy their souls, neither filltheir bowels: because it is the stumblingblock of their iniquity.   

{7:20} As for the beauty of his ornament, he set it in majesty: butthey made the images of their abominations [and] of their detestablethings therein: therefore have I set it far from them. 

{7:21} And Iwill give it into the hands of the strangers for a prey, and to thewicked of the earth for a spoil; and they shall pollute it. 

{7:22} Myface will I turn also from them, and they shall pollute my secret[place:] for the robbers shall enter into it, and defile it.   

{7:23} Make a chain: for the land is full of bloody crimes, and thecity is full of violence. 

{7:24} Wherefore I will bring the worst ofthe heathen, and they shall possess their houses: I will also make thepomp of the strong to cease; and their holy places shall be defiled.

{7:25} Destruction cometh; and they shall seek peace, and [there shallbe] none. 

{7:26} Mischief shall come upon mischief, and rumour shall beupon rumour; then shall they seek a vision of the prophet; but the lawshall perish from the priest, and counsel from the ancients. 

{7:27} Theking shall mourn, and the prince shall be clothed with desolation, andthe hands of the people of the land shall be troubled: I will do untothem after their way, and according to their deserts will I judge them;and they shall know that I [am] the LORD.   

{8:1} And it came to pass in the sixth year, in the sixth [month,]in the fifth [day] of the month, [as] I sat in mine house, and theelders of Judah sat before me, that the hand of the Lord GOD fell thereupon me. 

{8:2} Then I beheld, and lo a likeness as the appearance offire: from the appearance of his loins even downward, fire; and fromhis loins even upward, as the appearance of brightness, as the colourof amber. 

{8:3} And he put forth the form of an hand, and took me by alock of mine head; and the spirit lifted me up between the earth andthe heaven, and brought me in the visions of God to Jerusalem, to thedoor of the inner gate that looketh toward the north; where [was] theseat of the image of jealousy, which provoketh to jealousy. 

{8:4} And,behold, the glory of the God of Israel [was] there, according to thevision that I saw in the plain.   

{8:5} Then said he unto me, Son of man, lift up thine eyes now theway toward the north. So I lifted up mine eyes the way toward thenorth, and behold northward at the gate of the altar this image ofjealousy in the entry. 

{8:6} He said furthermore unto me, Son of man,seest thou what they do? [even] the great abominations that the houseof Israel committeth here, that I should go far off from my sanctuary?but turn thee yet again, [and] thou shalt see greater abominations.   

{8:7} And he brought me to the door of the court; and when I looked,behold a hole in the wall. 

{8:8} Then said he unto me, Son of man, dignow in the wall: and when I had digged in the wall, behold a door.

{8:9} And he said unto me, Go in, and behold the wicked abominationsthat they do here. 

{8:10} So I went in and saw; and behold every formof creeping things, and abominable beasts, and all the idols of thehouse of Israel, pourtrayed upon the wall round about. 

{8:11} And therestood before them seventy men of the ancients of the house of Israel,and in the midst of them stood Jaazaniah the son of Shaphan, with everyman his censer in his hand; and a thick cloud of incense went up.

{8:12} Then said he unto me, Son of man, hast thou seen what theancients of the house of Israel do in the dark, every man in thechambers of his imagery? for they say, The LORD seeth us not; the LORDhath forsaken the earth.   

{8:13} He said also unto me, Turn thee yet again, [and] thou shaltsee greater abominations that they do. 

{8:14} Then he brought me to thedoor of the gate of the LORD'S house which [was] toward the north; and,behold, there sat women weeping for Tammuz.   

{8:15} Then said he unto me, Hast thou seen [this,] O son of man?turn thee yet again, [and] thou shalt see greater abominations thanthese. 

{8:16} And he brought me into the inner court of the LORD'Shouse, and, behold, at the door of the temple of the LORD, between theporch and the altar, [were] about five and twenty men, with their backstoward the temple of the LORD, and their faces toward the east; andthey worshipped the sun toward the east.   

{8:17} Then he said unto me, Hast thou seen [this,] O son of man? Isit a light thing to the house of Judah that they commit theabominations which they commit here? for they have filled the land withviolence, and have returned to provoke me to anger: and, lo, they putthe branch to their nose. 

{8:18} Therefore will I also deal in fury:mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity: and though they cryin mine ears with a loud voice, [yet] will I not hear them.   

{9:1} He cried also in mine ears with a loud voice, saying, Causethem that have charge over the city to draw near, even every man [with]his destroying weapon in his hand. 

{9:2} And, behold, six men came fromthe way of the higher gate, which lieth toward the north, and every mana slaughter weapon in his hand; and one man among them [was] clothedwith linen, with a writer's inkhorn by his side: and they went in, andstood beside the brasen altar. 

{9:3} And the glory of the God of Israelwas gone up from the cherub, whereupon he was, to the threshold of thehouse. And he called to the man clothed with linen, which [had] thewriter's inkhorn by his side; 

{9:4} And the LORD said unto him, Gothrough the midst of the city, through the midst of Jerusalem, and seta mark upon the foreheads of the men that sigh and that cry for all theabominations that be done in the midst thereof.   

{9:5} And to the others he said in mine hearing, Go ye after himthrough the city, and smite: let not your eye spare, neither have yepity: 

{9:6} Slay utterly old [and] young, both maids, and littlechildren, and women: but come not near any man upon whom [is] the mark;and begin at my sanctuary. Then they began at the ancient men which[were] before the house. 

{9:7} And he said unto them, Defile the house,and fill the courts with the slain: go ye forth. And they went forth,and slew in the city.   

{9:8} And it came to pass, while they were slaying them, and I wasleft, that I fell upon my face, and cried, and said, Ah Lord GOD! wiltthou destroy all the residue of Israel in thy pouring out of thy furyupon Jerusalem? 

{9:9} Then said he unto me, The iniquity of the houseof Israel and Judah [is] exceeding great, and the land is full ofblood, and the city full of perverseness: for they say, The LORD hathforsaken the earth, and the LORD seeth not. 

{9:10} And as for me also,mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity, [but] I willrecompense their way upon their head. 

{9:11} And, behold, the manclothed with linen, which [had] the inkhorn by his side, reported thematter, saying, I have done as thou hast commanded me.   

{10:1} Then I looked, and, behold, in the firmament that was abovethe head of the cherubims there appeared over them as it were asapphire stone, as the appearance of the likeness of a throne. 

{10:2}And he spake unto the man clothed with linen, and said, Go in betweenthe wheels, [even] under the cherub, and fill thine hand with coals offire from between the cherubims, and scatter [them] over the city. Andhe went in in my sight. 

{10:3} Now the cherubims stood on the rightside of the house, when the man went in; and the cloud filled the innercourt. 

{10:4} Then the glory of the LORD went up from the cherub, [andstood] over the threshold of the house; and the house was filled withthe cloud, and the court was full of the brightness of the LORD'Sglory. 

{10:5} And the sound of the cherubims' wings was heard [even] tothe outer court, as the voice of the Almighty God when he speaketh.

{10:6} And it came to pass, [that] when he had commanded the manclothed with linen, saying, Take fire from between the wheels, frombetween the cherubims; then he went in, and stood beside the wheels.

{10:7} And [one] cherub stretched forth his hand from between thecherubims unto the fire that [was] between the cherubims, and took[thereof,] and put [it] into the hands of [him that was] clothed withlinen: who took [it,] and went out.   

{10:8} And there appeared in the cherubims the form of a man's handunder their wings. 

{10:9} And when I looked, behold the four wheels bythe cherubims, one wheel by one cherub, and another wheel by anothercherub: and the appearance of the wheels [was] as the colour of a berylstone. 

{10:10} And [as for] their appearances, they four had onelikeness, as if a wheel had been in the midst of a wheel. 

{10:11} Whenthey went, they went upon their four sides; they turned not as theywent, but to the place whither the head looked they followed it; theyturned not as they went. 

{10:12} And their whole body, and their backs,and their hands, and their wings, and the wheels, [were] full of eyesround about, [even] the wheels that they four had. 

{10:13} As for thewheels, it was cried unto them in my hearing, O wheel. 

{10:14} Andevery one had four faces: the first face [was] the face of a cherub,and the second face [was] the face of a man, and the third the face ofa lion, and the fourth the face of an eagle. 

{10:15} And the cherubimswere lifted up. This [is] the living creature that I saw by the riverof Chebar. 

{10:16} And when the cherubims went, the wheels went bythem: and when the cherubims lifted up their wings to mount up from theearth, the same wheels also turned not from beside them. 

{10:17} Whenthey stood, [these] stood; and when they were lifted up, [these] liftedup themselves [also:] for the spirit of the living creature [was] inthem. 

{10:18} Then the glory of the LORD departed from off thethreshold of the house, and stood over the cherubims. 

{10:19} And thecherubims lifted up their wings, and mounted up from the earth in mysight: when they went out, the wheels also [were] beside them, and[every one] stood at the door of the east gate of the LORD'S house; andthe glory of the God of Israel [was] over them above. 

{10:20} This [is]the living creature that I saw under the God of Israel by the river ofChebar; and I knew that they [were] the cherubims. 

{10:21} Every onehad four faces apiece, and every one four wings; and the likeness ofthe hands of a man [was] under their wings. 

{10:22} And the likeness oftheir faces [was] the same faces which I saw by the river of Chebar,their appearances and themselves: they went every one straight forward.   

{11:1} Moreover the spirit lifted me up, and brought me unto theeast gate of the LORD'S house, which looketh eastward: and behold atthe door of the gate five and twenty men; among whom I saw Jaazaniahthe son of Azur, and Pelatiah the son of Benaiah, the princes of thepeople. 

{11:2} Then said he unto me, Son of man, these [are] the menthat devise mischief, and give wicked counsel in this city: 

{11:3}Which say, [It is] not near; let us build houses: this [city is] thecaldron, and we [be] the flesh.   

{11:4} Therefore prophesy against them, prophesy, O son of man.

{11:5} And the Spirit of the LORD fell upon me, and said unto me,Speak; Thus saith the LORD; Thus have ye said, O house of Israel: for Iknow the things that come into your mind, [every one of] them. 

{11:6}Ye have multiplied your slain in this city, and ye have filled thestreets thereof with the slain. 

{11:7} Therefore thus saith the LordGOD; Your slain whom ye have laid in the midst of it, they [are] theflesh, and this [city is] the caldron: but I will bring you forth outof the midst of it. 

{11:8} Ye have feared the sword; and I will bring asword upon you, saith the Lord GOD. 

{11:9} And I will bring you out ofthe midst thereof, and deliver you into the hands of strangers, andwill execute judgments among you. 

{11:10} Ye shall fall by the sword; Iwill judge you in the border of Israel; and ye shall know that I [am]the LORD. 

{11:11} This [city] shall not be your caldron, neither shallye be the flesh in the midst thereof; [but] I will judge you in theborder of Israel: 

{11:12} And ye shall know that I [am] the LORD: forye have not walked in my statutes, neither executed my judgments, buthave done after the manners of the heathen that [are] round about you.   

{11:13} And it came to pass, when I prophesied, that Pelatiah theson of Benaiah died. Then fell I down upon my face, and cried with aloud voice, and said, Ah Lord GOD! wilt thou make a full end of theremnant of Israel? 

{11:14} Again the word of the LORD came unto me,saying, 

{11:15} Son of man, thy brethren, [even] thy brethren, the menof thy kindred, and all the house of Israel wholly, [are] they untowhom the inhabitants of Jerusalem have said, Get you far from the LORD:unto us is this land given in possession. 

{11:16} Therefore say, Thussaith the Lord GOD; Although I have cast them far off among theheathen, and although I have scattered them among the countries, yetwill I be to them as a little sanctuary in the countries where theyshall come. 

{11:17} Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will evengather you from the people, and assemble you out of the countries whereye have been scattered, and I will give you the land of Israel. 

{11:18}And they shall come thither, and they shall take away all thedetestable things thereof and all the abominations thereof from thence.

{11:19} And I will give them one heart, and I will put a new spiritwithin you; and I will take the stony heart out of their flesh, andwill give them an heart of flesh: 

{11:20} That they may walk in mystatutes, and keep mine ordinances, and do them: and they shall be mypeople, and I will be their God. 

{11:21} But [as for them] whose heartwalketh after the heart of their detestable things and theirabominations, I will recompense their way upon their own heads, saiththe Lord GOD.   

{11:22} Then did the cherubims lift up their wings, and the wheelsbeside them; and the glory of the God of Israel [was] over them above.

{11:23} And the glory of the LORD went up from the midst of the city,and stood upon the mountain which [is] on the east side of the city.   

{11:24} Afterwards the spirit took me up, and brought me in a visionby the Spirit of God into Chaldea, to them of the captivity. So thevision that I had seen went up from me. 

{11:25} Then I spake unto themof the captivity all the things that the LORD had shewed me.   

{12:1} The word of the LORD also came unto me, saying, 

{12:2} Son ofman, thou dwellest in the midst of a rebellious house, which have eyesto see, and see not; they have ears to hear, and hear not: for they[are] a rebellious house. 

{12:3} Therefore, thou son of man, preparethee stuff for removing, and remove by day in their sight; and thoushalt remove from thy place to another place in their sight: it may bethey will consider, though they [be] a rebellious house. 

{12:4} Thenshalt thou bring forth thy stuff by day in their sight, as stuff forremoving: and thou shalt go forth at even in their sight, as they thatgo forth into captivity. 

{12:5} Dig thou through the wall in theirsight, and carry out thereby. 

{12:6} In their sight shalt thou bear[it] upon [thy] shoulders, [and] carry [it] forth in the twilight: thoushalt cover thy face, that thou see not the ground: for I have set thee[for] a sign unto the house of Israel. 

{12:7} And I did so as I wascommanded: I brought forth my stuff by day, as stuff for captivity, andin the even I digged through the wall with mine hand; I brought [it]forth in the twilight, [and] I bare [it] upon [my] shoulder in theirsight.   

{12:8} And in the morning came the word of the LORD unto me, saying,

{12:9} Son of man, hath not the house of Israel, the rebellious house,said unto thee, What doest thou? 

{12:10} Say thou unto them, Thus saiththe Lord GOD; This burden [concerneth] the prince in Jerusalem, and allthe house of Israel that [are] among them. 

{12:11} Say, I [am] yoursign: like as I have done, so shall it be done unto them: they shallremove [and] go into captivity. 

{12:12} And the prince that [is] amongthem shall bear upon [his] shoulder in the twilight, and shall goforth: they shall dig through the wall to carry out thereby: he shallcover his face, that he see not the ground with [his] eyes. 

{12:13} Mynet also will I spread upon him, and he shall be taken in my snare: andI will bring him to Babylon [to] the land of the Chaldeans; yet shallhe not see it, though he shall die there. 

{12:14} And I will scattertoward every wind all that [are] about him to help him, and all hisbands; and I will draw out the sword after them. 

{12:15} And they shallknow that I [am] the LORD, when I shall scatter them among the nations,and disperse them in the countries. 

{12:16} But I will leave a few menof them from the sword, from the famine, and from the pestilence; thatthey may declare all their abominations among the heathen whither theycome; and they shall know that I [am] the LORD.   

{12:17} Moreover the word of the LORD came to me, saying, 

{12:18}Son of man, eat thy bread with quaking, and drink thy water withtrembling and with carefulness; 

{12:19} And say unto the people of theland, Thus saith the Lord GOD of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, [and] ofthe land of Israel; They shall eat their bread with carefulness, anddrink their water with astonishment, that her land may be desolate fromall that is therein, because of the violence of all them that dwelltherein. 

{12:20} And the cities that are inhabited shall be laid waste,and the land shall be desolate; and ye shall know that I [am] the LORD.   

{12:21} And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 

{12:22} Sonof man, what [is] that proverb [that] ye have in the land of Israel,saying, The days are prolonged, and every vision faileth? 

{12:23} Tellthem therefore, Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will make this proverb tocease, and they shall no more use it as a proverb in Israel; but sayunto them, The days are at hand, and the effect of every vision.

{12:24} For there shall be no more any vain vision nor flatteringdivination within the house of Israel. 

{12:25} For I [am] the LORD: Iwill speak, and the word that I shall speak shall come to pass; itshall be no more prolonged: for in your days, O rebellious house, willI say the word, and will perform it, saith the Lord GOD.   

{12:26} Again the word of the LORD came to me, saying, 

{12:27} Sonof man, behold, [they of] the house of Israel say, The vision that heseeth [is] for many days [to come,] and he prophesieth of the times[that are] far off. 

{12:28} Therefore say unto them, Thus saith theLord GOD; There shall none of my words be prolonged any more, but theword which I have spoken shall be done, saith the Lord GOD.   

{13:1} And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 

{13:2} Son ofman, prophesy against the prophets of Israel that prophesy, and saythou unto them that prophesy out of their own hearts, Hear ye the wordof the LORD; 

{13:3} Thus saith the Lord GOD; Woe unto the foolishprophets, that follow their own spirit, and have seen nothing! 

{13:4} OIsrael, thy prophets are like the foxes in the deserts. 

{13:5} Ye havenot gone up into the gaps, neither made up the hedge for the house ofIsrael to stand in the battle in the day of the LORD. 

{13:6} They haveseen vanity and lying divination, saying, The LORD saith: and the LORDhath not sent them: and they have made [others] to hope that they wouldconfirm the word. 

{13:7} Have ye not seen a vain vision, and have yenot spoken a lying divination, whereas ye say, The LORD saith [it;]albeit I have not spoken? 

{13:8} Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD;Because ye have spoken vanity, and seen lies, therefore, behold, I [am]against you, saith the Lord GOD. 

{13:9} And mine hand shall be upon theprophets that see vanity, and that divine lies: they shall not be inthe assembly of my people, neither shall they be written in the writingof the house of Israel, neither shall they enter into the land ofIsrael; and ye shall know that I [am] the Lord GOD.   

{13:10} Because, even because they have seduced my people, saying,Peace; and [there was] no peace; and one built up a wall, and, lo,others daubed it with untempered [morter: ]

{13:11} Say unto them whichdaub it with untempered [morter,] that it shall fall: there shall be anoverflowing shower; and ye, O great hailstones, shall fall; and astormy wind shall rend [it. ]

{13:12} Lo, when the wall is fallen, shallit not be said unto you, Where [is] the daubing wherewith ye havedaubed [it? ]

{13:13} Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; I will evenrend [it] with a stormy wind in my fury; and there shall be anoverflowing shower in mine anger, and great hailstones in [my] fury toconsume [it. ]

{13:14} So will I break down the wall that ye have daubedwith untempered [morter,] and bring it down to the ground, so that thefoundation thereof shall be discovered, and it shall fall, and ye shallbe consumed in the midst thereof: and ye shall know that I [am] theLORD. 

{13:15} Thus will I accomplish my wrath upon the wall, and uponthem that have daubed it with untempered [morter,] and will say untoyou, The wall [is] no [more,] neither they that daubed it; 

{13:16} [Towit,] the prophets of Israel which prophesy concerning Jerusalem, andwhich see visions of peace for her, and [there is] no peace, saith theLord GOD.   

{13:17} Likewise, thou son of man, set thy face against thedaughters of thy people, which prophesy out of their own heart; andprophesy thou against them, 

{13:18} And say, Thus saith the Lord GOD;Woe to the [women] that sew pillows to all armholes, and make kerchiefsupon the head of every stature to hunt souls! Will ye hunt the souls ofmy people, and will ye save the souls alive [that come] unto you?

{13:19} And will ye pollute me among my people for handfuls of barleyand for pieces of bread, to slay the souls that should not die, and tosave the souls alive that should not live, by your lying to my peoplethat hear [your] lies? 

{13:20} Wherefore thus saith the Lord GOD;Behold, I [am] against your pillows, wherewith ye there hunt the soulsto make [them] fly, and I will tear them from your arms, and will letthe souls go, [even] the souls that ye hunt to make [them] fly. 

{13:21}Your kerchiefs also will I tear, and deliver my people out of yourhand, and they shall be no more in your hand to be hunted; and ye shallknow that I [am] the LORD. 

{13:22} Because with lies ye have made theheart of the righteous sad, whom I have not made sad; and strengthenedthe hands of the wicked, that he should not return from his wicked way,by promising him life: 

{13:23} Therefore ye shall see no more vanity,nor divine divinations: for I will deliver my people out of your hand:and ye shall know that I [am] the LORD.   

{14:1} Then came certain of the elders of Israel unto me, and satbefore me. 

{14:2} And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 

{14:3}Son of man, these men have set up their idols in their heart, and putthe stumblingblock of their iniquity before their face: should I beenquired of at all by them? 

{14:4} Therefore speak unto them, and sayunto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Every man of the house of Israelthat setteth up his idols in his heart, and putteth the stumblingblockof his iniquity before his face, and cometh to the prophet; I the LORDwill answer him that cometh according to the multitude of his idols;

{14:5} That I may take the house of Israel in their own heart, becausethey are all estranged from me through their idols.   

{14:6} Therefore say unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the LordGOD; Repent, and turn [yourselves] from your idols; and turn away yourfaces from all your abominations. 

{14:7} For every one of the house ofIsrael, or of the stranger that sojourneth in Israel, which separatethhimself from me, and setteth up his idols in his heart, and putteth thestumblingblock of his iniquity before his face, and cometh to a prophetto enquire of him concerning me; I the LORD will answer him by myself:

{14:8} And I will set my face against that man, and will make him asign and a proverb, and I will cut him off from the midst of my people;and ye shall know that I [am] the LORD. 

{14:9} And if the prophet bedeceived when he hath spoken a thing, I the LORD have deceived thatprophet, and I will stretch out my hand upon him, and will destroy himfrom the midst of my people Israel. 

{14:10} And they shall bear thepunishment of their iniquity: the punishment of the prophet shall beeven as the punishment of him that seeketh [unto him; ]

{14:11} That thehouse of Israel may go no more astray from me, neither be polluted anymore with all their transgressions; but that they may be my people, andI may be their God, saith the Lord GOD.   

{14:12} The word of the LORD came again to me, saying, 

{14:13} Sonof man, when the land sinneth against me by trespassing grievously,then will I stretch out mine hand upon it, and will break the staff ofthe bread thereof, and will send famine upon it, and will cut off manand beast from it: 

{14:14} Though these three men, Noah, Daniel, andJob, were in it, they should deliver [but] their own souls by theirrighteousness, saith the Lord GOD.   

{14:15} If I cause noisome beasts to pass through the land, and theyspoil it, so that it be desolate, that no man may pass through becauseof the beasts: 

{14:16} [Though] these three men [were] in it, [as] Ilive, saith the Lord GOD, they shall deliver neither sons nordaughters; they only shall be delivered, but the land shall be desolate.   

{14:17} Or [if] I bring a sword upon that land, and say, Sword, gothrough the land; so that I cut off man and beast from it: 

{14:18}Though these three men [were] in it, [as] I live, saith the Lord GOD,they shall deliver neither sons nor daughters, but they only shall bedelivered themselves.   

{14:19} Or [if] I send a pestilence into that land, and pour out myfury upon it in blood, to cut off from it man and beast: 

{14:20} ThoughNoah, Daniel, and Job, [were] in it, [as] I live, saith the Lord GOD,they shall deliver neither son nor daughter; they shall [but] delivertheir own souls by their righteousness. 

{14:21} For thus saith the LordGOD; How much more when I send my four sore judgments upon Jerusalem,the sword, and the famine, and the noisome beast, and the pestilence,to cut off from it man and beast?   

{14:22} Yet, behold, therein shall be left a remnant that shall bebrought forth, [both] sons and daughters: behold, they shall come forthunto you, and ye shall see their way and their doings: and ye shall becomforted concerning the evil that I have brought upon Jerusalem,[even] concerning all that I have brought upon it. 

{14:23} And theyshall comfort you, when ye see their ways and their doings: and yeshall know that I have not done without cause all that I have done init, saith the Lord GOD.   

{15:1} And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 

{15:2} Son ofman, What is the vine tree more than any tree, [or than] a branch whichis among the trees of the forest? 

{15:3} Shall wood be taken thereof todo any work? or will [men] take a pin of it to hang any vessel thereon?

{15:4} Behold, it is cast into the fire for fuel; the fire devourethboth the ends of it, and the midst of it is burned. Is it meet for[any] work? 

{15:5} Behold, when it was whole, it was meet for no work:how much less shall it be meet yet for [any] work, when the fire hathdevoured it, and it is burned?   

{15:6} Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; As the vine tree among thetrees of the forest, which I have given to the fire for fuel, so will Igive the inhabitants of Jerusalem. 

{15:7} And I will set my faceagainst them; they shall go out from [one] fire, and [another] fireshall devour them; and ye shall know that I [am] the LORD, when I setmy face against them. 

{15:8} And I will make the land desolate, becausethey have committed a trespass, saith the Lord GOD.   

{16:1} Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 

{16:2} Sonof man, cause Jerusalem to know her abominations, 

{16:3} And say, Thussaith the Lord GOD unto Jerusalem; Thy birth and thy nativity [is] ofthe land of Canaan; thy father [was] an Amorite, and thy mother anHittite. 

{16:4} And [as for] thy nativity, in the day thou wast bornthy navel was not cut, neither wast thou washed in water to supple[thee;] thou wast not salted at all, nor swaddled at all. 

{16:5} Noneeye pitied thee, to do any of these unto thee, to have compassion uponthee; but thou wast cast out in the open field, to the lothing of thyperson, in the day that thou wast born.   

{16:6} And when I passed by thee, and saw thee polluted in thine ownblood, I said unto thee [when thou wast] in thy blood, Live; yea, Isaid unto thee [when thou wast] in thy blood, Live. 

{16:7} I havecaused thee to multiply as the bud of the field, and thou hastincreased and waxen great, and thou art come to excellent ornaments:[thy] breasts are fashioned, and thine hair is grown, whereas thou[wast] naked and bare. 

{16:8} Now when I passed by thee, and lookedupon thee, behold, thy time [was] the time of love; and I spread myskirt over thee, and covered thy nakedness: yea, I sware unto thee, andentered into a covenant with thee, saith the Lord GOD, and thoubecamest mine. 

{16:9} Then washed I thee with water; yea, I throughlywashed away thy blood from thee, and I anointed thee with oil. 

{16:10}I clothed thee also with broidered work, and shod thee with badgers'skin, and I girded thee about with fine linen, and I covered thee withsilk. 

{16:11} I decked thee also with ornaments, and I put braceletsupon thy hands, and a chain on thy neck. 

{16:12} And I put a jewel onthy forehead, and earrings in thine ears, and a beautiful crown uponthine head. 

{16:13} Thus wast thou decked with gold and silver; and thyraiment [was of] fine linen, and silk, and broidered work; thou didsteat fine flour, and honey, and oil: and thou wast exceeding beautiful,and thou didst prosper into a kingdom. 

{16:14} And thy renown wentforth among the heathen for thy beauty: for it [was] perfect through mycomeliness, which I had put upon thee, saith the Lord GOD. 

{16:15} Butthou didst trust in thine own beauty, and playedst the harlot becauseof thy renown, and pouredst out thy fornications on every one thatpassed by; his it was. 

{16:16} And of thy garments thou didst take, anddeckedst thy high places with divers colours, and playedst the harlotthereupon: [the like things] shall not come, neither shall it be so.

{16:17} Thou hast also taken thy fair jewels of my gold and of mysilver, which I had given thee, and madest to thyself images of men,and didst commit whoredom with them, 

{16:18} And tookest thy broideredgarments, and coveredst them: and thou hast set mine oil and mineincense before them. 

{16:19} My meat also which I gave thee, fineflour, and oil, and honey, [wherewith] I fed thee, thou hast even setit before them for a sweet savour: and [thus] it was, saith the LordGOD. 

{16:20} Moreover thou hast taken thy sons and thy daughters, whomthou hast borne unto me, and these hast thou sacrificed unto them to bedevoured. [Is this] of thy whoredoms a small matter, 

{16:21} That thouhast slain my children, and delivered them to cause them to passthrough [the fire] for them? 

{16:22} And in all thine abominations andthy whoredoms thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth, when thouwast naked and bare, [and] wast polluted in thy blood. 

{16:23} And itcame to pass after all thy wickedness, (woe, woe unto thee! saith theLord GOD;) 

{16:24} [That] thou hast also built unto thee an eminentplace, and hast made thee an high place in every street. 

{16:25} Thouhast built thy high place at every head of the way, and hast made thybeauty to be abhorred, and hast opened thy feet to every one thatpassed by, and multiplied thy whoredoms. 

{16:26} Thou hast alsocommitted fornication with the Egyptians thy neighbours, great offlesh; and hast increased thy whoredoms, to provoke me to anger.

{16:27} Behold, therefore I have stretched out my hand over thee, andhave diminished thine ordinary [food,] and delivered thee unto the willof them that hate thee, the daughters of the Philistines, which areashamed of thy lewd way. 

{16:28} Thou hast played the whore also withthe Assyrians, because thou wast unsatiable; yea, thou hast played theharlot with them, and yet couldest not be satisfied. 

{16:29} Thou hastmoreover multiplied thy fornication in the land of Canaan unto Chaldea;and yet thou wast not satisfied herewith. 

{16:30} How weak is thineheart, saith the Lord GOD, seeing thou doest all these [things,] thework of an imperious whorish woman; 

{16:31} In that thou buildest thineeminent place in the head of every way, and makest thine high place inevery street; and hast not been as an harlot, in that thou scornesthire; 

{16:32} [But as] a wife that committeth adultery, [which] takethstrangers instead of her husband! 

{16:33} They give gifts to allwhores: but thou givest thy gifts to all thy lovers, and hirest them,that they may come unto thee on every side for thy whoredom. 

{16:34}And the contrary is in thee from [other] women in thy whoredoms,whereas none followeth thee to commit whoredoms: and in that thougivest a reward, and no reward is given unto thee, therefore thou artcontrary.   

{16:35} Wherefore, O harlot, hear the word of the LORD: 

{16:36} Thussaith the Lord GOD; Because thy filthiness was poured out, and thynakedness discovered through thy whoredoms with thy lovers, and withall the idols of thy abominations, and by the blood of thy children,which thou didst give unto them; 

{16:37} Behold, therefore I willgather all thy lovers, with whom thou hast taken pleasure, and all[them] that thou hast loved, with all [them] that thou hast hated; Iwill even gather them round about against thee, and will discover thynakedness unto them, that they may see all thy nakedness. 

{16:38} And Iwill judge thee, as women that break wedlock and shed blood are judged;and I will give thee blood in fury and jealousy. 

{16:39} And I willalso give thee into their hand, and they shall throw down thine eminentplace, and shall break down thy high places: they shall strip thee alsoof thy clothes, and shall take thy fair jewels, and leave thee nakedand bare. 

{16:40} They shall also bring up a company against thee, andthey shall stone thee with stones, and thrust thee through with theirswords. 

{16:41} And they shall burn thine houses with fire, and executejudgments upon thee in the sight of many women: and I will cause theeto cease from playing the harlot, and thou also shalt give no hire anymore. 

{16:42} So will I make my fury toward thee to rest, and myjealousy shall depart from thee, and I will be quiet, and will be nomore angry. 

{16:43} Because thou hast not remembered the days of thyyouth, but hast fretted me in all these [things;] behold, therefore Ialso will recompense thy way upon [thine] head, saith the Lord GOD: andthou shalt not commit this lewdness above all thine abominations.   

{16:44} Behold, every one that useth proverbs shall use [this]proverb against thee, saying, As is the mother, [so is] her daughter.

{16:45} Thou [art] thy mother's daughter, that lotheth her husband andher children; and thou [art] the sister of thy sisters, which lothedtheir husbands and their children: your mother [was] an Hittite, andyour father an Amorite. 

{16:46} And thine elder sister [is] Samaria,she and her daughters that dwell at thy left hand: and thy youngersister, that dwelleth at thy right hand, [is] Sodom and her daughters.

{16:47} Yet hast thou not walked after their ways, nor done after theirabominations: but, as [if that were] a very little [thing,] thou wastcorrupted more than they in all thy ways. 

{16:48} [As] I live, saiththe Lord GOD, Sodom thy sister hath not done, she nor her daughters, asthou hast done, thou and thy daughters. 

{16:49} Behold, this was theiniquity of thy sister Sodom, pride, fulness of bread, and abundance ofidleness was in her and in her daughters, neither did she strengthenthe hand of the poor and needy. 

{16:50} And they were haughty, andcommitted abomination before me: therefore I took them away as I saw[good. ]

{16:51} Neither hath Samaria committed half of thy sins; butthou hast multiplied thine abominations more than they, and hastjustified thy sisters in all thine abominations which thou hast done.

{16:52} Thou also, which hast judged thy sisters, bear thine own shamefor thy sins that thou hast committed more abominable than they: theyare more righteous than thou: yea, be thou confounded also, and bearthy shame, in that thou hast justified thy sisters. 

{16:53} When Ishall bring again their captivity, the captivity of Sodom and herdaughters, and the captivity of Samaria and her daughters, then [will Ibring again] the captivity of thy captives in the midst of them:

{16:54} That thou mayest bear thine own shame, and mayest be confoundedin all that thou hast done, in that thou art a comfort unto them.

{16:55} When thy sisters, Sodom and her daughters, shall return totheir former estate, and Samaria and her daughters shall return totheir former estate, then thou and thy daughters shall return to yourformer estate. 

{16:56} For thy sister Sodom was not mentioned by thymouth in the day of thy pride, 

{16:57} Before thy wickedness wasdiscovered, as at the time of [thy] reproach of the daughters of Syria,and all [that are] round about her, the daughters of the Philistines,which despise thee round about. 

{16:58} Thou hast borne thy lewdnessand thine abominations, saith the LORD. 

{16:59} For thus saith the LordGOD; I will even deal with thee as thou hast done, which hast despisedthe oath in breaking the covenant.   

{16:60} Nevertheless I will remember my covenant with thee in thedays of thy youth, and I will establish unto thee an everlastingcovenant. 

{16:61} Then thou shalt remember thy ways, and be ashamed,when thou shalt receive thy sisters, thine elder and thy younger: and Iwill give them unto thee for daughters, but not by thy covenant.

{16:62} And I will establish my covenant with thee; and thou shalt knowthat I [am] the LORD: 

{16:63} That thou mayest remember, and beconfounded, and never open thy mouth any more because of thy shame,when I am pacified toward thee for all that thou hast done, saith theLord GOD.   

{17:1} And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 

{17:2} Son ofman, put forth a riddle, and speak a parable unto the house of Israel;

{17:3} And say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; A great eagle with greatwings, longwinged, full of feathers, which had divers colours, cameunto Lebanon, and took the highest branch of the cedar: 

{17:4} Hecropped off the top of his young twigs, and carried it into a land oftraffick; he set it in a city of merchants. 

{17:5} He took also of theseed of the land, and planted it in a fruitful field; he placed [it] bygreat waters, [and] set it [as] a willow tree. 

{17:6} And it grew, andbecame a spreading vine of low stature, whose branches turned towardhim, and the roots thereof were under him: so it became a vine, andbrought forth branches, and shot forth sprigs. 

{17:7} There was alsoanother great eagle with great wings and many feathers: and, behold,this vine did bend her roots toward him, and shot forth her branchestoward him, that he might water it by the furrows of her plantation.

{17:8} It was planted in a good soil by great waters, that it mightbring forth branches, and that it might bear fruit, that it might be agoodly vine. 

{17:9} Say thou, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Shall itprosper? shall he not pull up the roots thereof, and cut off the fruitthereof, that it wither? it shall wither in all the leaves of herspring, even without great power or many people to pluck it up by theroots thereof. 

{17:10} Yea, behold, [being] planted, shall it prosper?shall it not utterly wither, when the east wind toucheth it? it shallwither in the furrows where it grew.   

{17:11} Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 

{17:12}Say now to the rebellious house, Know ye not what these [things mean?]tell [them,] Behold, the king of Babylon is come to Jerusalem, and hathtaken the king thereof, and the princes thereof, and led them with himto Babylon; 

{17:13} And hath taken of the king's seed, and made acovenant with him, and hath taken an oath of him: he hath also takenthe mighty of the land: 

{17:14} That the kingdom might be base, that itmight not lift itself up, [but] that by keeping of his covenant itmight stand. 

{17:15} But he rebelled against him in sending hisambassadors into Egypt, that they might give him horses and muchpeople. Shall he prosper? shall he escape that doeth such [things?] orshall he break the covenant, and be delivered? 

{17:16} As I live, saiththe Lord GOD, surely in the place [where] the king [dwelleth] that madehim king, whose oath he despised, and whose covenant he brake, [even]with him in the midst of Babylon he shall die. 

{17:17} Neither shallPharaoh with [his] mighty army and great company make for him in thewar, by casting up mounts, and building forts, to cut off many persons:

{17:18} Seeing he despised the oath by breaking the covenant, when, lo,he had given his hand, and hath done all these [things,] he shall notescape. 

{17:19} Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; [As] I live, surelymine oath that he hath despised, and my covenant that he hath broken,even it will I recompense upon his own head. 

{17:20} And I will spreadmy net upon him, and he shall be taken in my snare, and I will bringhim to Babylon, and will plead with him there for his trespass that hehath trespassed against me. 

{17:21} And all his fugitives with all hisbands shall fall by the sword, and they that remain shall be scatteredtoward all winds: and ye shall know that I the LORD have spoken [it.]   

{17:22} Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will also take of the highestbranch of the high cedar, and will set [it;] I will crop off from thetop of his young twigs a tender one, and will plant [it] upon an highmountain and eminent: 

{17:23} In the mountain of the height of Israelwill I plant it: and it shall bring forth boughs, and bear fruit, andbe a goodly cedar: and under it shall dwell all fowl of every wing; inthe shadow of the branches thereof shall they dwell. 

{17:24} And allthe trees of the field shall know that I the LORD have brought down thehigh tree, have exalted the low tree, have dried up the green tree, andhave made the dry tree to flourish: I the LORD have brought down thehigh tree, have exalted the low tree, have dried up the green tree, andhave made the dry tree to flourish: I the LORD have spoken and havedone [it.]   

{18:1} The word of the LORD came unto me again, saying, 

{18:2} Whatmean ye, that ye use this proverb concerning the land of Israel,saying, The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the children's teethare set on edge? 

{18:3} [As] I live, saith the Lord GOD, ye shall nothave [occasion] any more to use this proverb in Israel. 

{18:4} Behold,all souls are mine; as the soul of the father, so also the soul of theson is mine: the soul that sinneth, it shall die.   

{18:5} But if a man be just, and do that which is lawful and right,

{18:6} [And] hath not eaten upon the mountains, neither hath lifted uphis eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, neither hath defiled hisneighbour's wife, neither hath come near to a menstruous woman, 

{18:7}And hath not oppressed any, [but] hath restored to the debtor hispledge, hath spoiled none by violence, hath given his bread to thehungry, and hath covered the naked with a garment; 

{18:8} He [that]hath not given forth upon usury, neither hath taken any increase,[that] hath withdrawn his hand from iniquity, hath executed truejudgment between man and man, 

{18:9} Hath walked in my statutes, andhath kept my judgments, to deal truly; he [is] just, he shall surelylive, saith the Lord GOD.   

{18:10} If he beget a son [that is] a robber, a shedder of blood,and [that] doeth the like to [any] one of these [things, ]

{18:11} Andthat doeth not any of those [duties,] but even hath eaten upon themountains, and defiled his neighbour's wife, 

{18:12} Hath oppressed thepoor and needy, hath spoiled by violence, hath not restored the pledge,and hath lifted up his eyes to the idols, hath committed abomination,

{18:13} Hath given forth upon usury, and hath taken increase: shall hethen live? he shall not live: he hath done all these abominations; heshall surely die; his blood shall be upon him.   

{18:14} Now, lo, [if] he beget a son, that seeth all his father'ssins which he hath done, and considereth, and doeth not such like,

{18:15} [That] hath not eaten upon the mountains, neither hath liftedup his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, hath not defiled hisneighbour's wife, 

{18:16} Neither hath oppressed any, hath notwithholden the pledge, neither hath spoiled by violence, [but] hathgiven his bread to the hungry, and hath covered the naked with agarment, 

{18:17} [That] hath taken off his hand from the poor, [that]hath not received usury nor increase, hath executed my judgments, hathwalked in my statutes; he shall not die for the iniquity of his father,he shall surely live. 

{18:18} [As for] his father, because he cruellyoppressed, spoiled his brother by violence, and did [that] which [is]not good among his people, lo, even he shall die in his iniquity.   

{18:19} Yet say ye, Why? doth not the son bear the iniquity of thefather? When the son hath done that which is lawful and right, [and]hath kept all my statutes, and hath done them, he shall surely live.

{18:20} The soul that sinneth, it shall die. The son shall not bear theiniquity of the father, neither shall the father bear the iniquity ofthe son: the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him, and thewickedness of the wicked shall be upon him. 

{18:21} But if the wickedwill turn from all his sins that he hath committed, and keep all mystatutes, and do that which is lawful and right, he shall surely live,he shall not die. 

{18:22} All his transgressions that he hathcommitted, they shall not be mentioned unto him: in his righteousnessthat he hath done he shall live. 

{18:23} Have I any pleasure at allthat the wicked should die? saith the Lord GOD: [and] not that heshould return from his ways, and live?   

{18:24} But when the righteous turneth away from his righteousness,and committeth iniquity, [and] doeth according to all the abominationsthat the wicked [man] doeth, shall he live? All his righteousness thathe hath done shall not be mentioned: in his trespass that he hathtrespassed, and in his sin that he hath sinned, in them shall he die.   

{18:25} Yet ye say, The way of the Lord is not equal. Hear now, Ohouse of Israel; Is not my way equal? are not your ways unequal?

{18:26} When a righteous [man] turneth away from his righteousness, andcommitteth iniquity, and dieth in them; for his iniquity that he hathdone shall he die. 

{18:27} Again, when the wicked [man] turneth awayfrom his wickedness that he hath committed, and doeth that which islawful and right, he shall save his soul alive. 

{18:28} Because heconsidereth, and turneth away from all his transgressions that he hathcommitted, he shall surely live, he shall not die. 

{18:29} Yet saiththe house of Israel, The way of the Lord is not equal. O house ofIsrael, are not my ways equal? are not your ways unequal? 

{18:30}Therefore I will judge you, O house of Israel, every one according tohis ways, saith the Lord GOD. Repent, and turn [yourselves] from allyour transgressions; so iniquity shall not be your ruin.   

{18:31} Cast away from you all your transgressions, whereby ye havetransgressed; and make you a new heart and a new spirit: for why willye die, O house of Israel? 

{18:32} For I have no pleasure in the deathof him that dieth, saith the Lord GOD: wherefore turn [yourselves,] andlive ye.   

{19:1} Moreover take thou up a lamentation for the princes ofIsrael, 

{19:2} And say, What [is] thy mother? A lioness: she lay downamong lions, she nourished her whelps among young lions. 

{19:3} And shebrought up one of her whelps: it became a young lion, and it learned tocatch the prey; it devoured men. 

{19:4} The nations also heard of him;he was taken in their pit, and they brought him with chains unto theland of Egypt. 

{19:5} Now when she saw that she had waited, [and] herhope was lost, then she took another of her whelps, [and] made him ayoung lion. 

{19:6} And he went up and down among the lions, he became ayoung lion, and learned to catch the prey, [and] devoured men. 

{19:7}And he knew their desolate palaces, and he laid waste their cities; andthe land was desolate, and the fulness thereof, by the noise of hisroaring. 

{19:8} Then the nations set against him on every side from theprovinces, and spread their net over him: he was taken in their pit.

{19:9} And they put him in ward in chains, and brought him to the kingof Babylon: they brought him into holds, that his voice should no morebe heard upon the mountains of Israel.   

{19:10} Thy mother [is] like a vine in thy blood, planted by thewaters: she was fruitful and full of branches by reason of many waters.

{19:11} And she had strong rods for the sceptres of them that barerule, and her stature was exalted among the thick branches, and sheappeared in her height with the multitude of her branches. 

{19:12} Butshe was plucked up in fury, she was cast down to the ground, and theeast wind dried up her fruit: her strong rods were broken and withered;the fire consumed them. 

{19:13} And now she [is] planted in thewilderness, in a dry and thirsty ground. 

{19:14} And fire is gone outof a rod of her branches, [which] hath devoured her fruit, so that shehath no strong rod [to be] a sceptre to rule. This [is] a lamentation,and shall be for a lamentation.   

{20:1} And it came to pass in the seventh year, in the fifth[month,] the tenth [day] of the month, [that] certain of the elders ofIsrael came to enquire of the LORD, and sat before me. 

{20:2} Then camethe word of the LORD unto me, saying, 

{20:3} Son of man, speak unto theelders of Israel, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Are yecome to enquire of me? [As] I live, saith the Lord GOD, I will not beenquired of by you. 

{20:4} Wilt thou judge them, son of man, wilt thoujudge [them?] cause them to know the abominations of their fathers:   

{20:5} And say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; In the day when Ichose Israel, and lifted up mine hand unto the seed of the house ofJacob, and made myself known unto them in the land of Egypt, when Ilifted up mine hand unto them, saying, I [am] the LORD your God; 

{20:6}In the day [that] I lifted up mine hand unto them, to bring them forthof the land of Egypt into a land that I had espied for them, flowingwith milk and honey, which [is] the glory of all lands: 

{20:7} Thensaid I unto them, Cast ye away every man the abominations of his eyes,and defile not yourselves with the idols of Egypt: I [am] the LORD yourGod. 

{20:8} But they rebelled against me, and would not hearken untome: they did not every man cast away the abominations of their eyes,neither did they forsake the idols of Egypt: then I said, I will pourout my fury upon them to accomplish my anger against them in the midstof the land of Egypt. 

{20:9} But I wrought for my name's sake, that itshould not be polluted before the heathen, among whom they [were,] inwhose sight I made myself known unto them, in bringing them forth outof the land of Egypt.   

{20:10} Wherefore I caused them to go forth out of the land ofEgypt, and brought them into the wilderness. 

{20:11} And I gave them mystatutes, and shewed them my judgments, which [if] a man do, he shalleven live in them. 

{20:12} Moreover also I gave them my sabbaths, to bea sign between me and them, that they might know that I [am] the LORDthat sanctify them. 

{20:13} But the house of Israel rebelled against mein the wilderness: they walked not in my statutes, and they despised myjudgments, which [if] a man do, he shall even live in them; and mysabbaths they greatly polluted: then I said, I would pour out my furyupon them in the wilderness, to consume them. 

{20:14} But I wrought formy name's sake, that it should not be polluted before the heathen, inwhose sight I brought them out. 

{20:15} Yet also I lifted up my handunto them in the wilderness, that I would not bring them into the landwhich I had given [them,] flowing with milk and honey, which [is] theglory of all lands; 

{20:16} Because they despised my judgments, andwalked not in my statutes, but polluted my sabbaths: for their heartwent after their idols. 

{20:17} Nevertheless mine eye spared them fromdestroying them, neither did I make an end of them in the wilderness.

{20:18} But I said unto their children in the wilderness, Walk ye notin the statutes of your fathers, neither observe their judgments, nordefile yourselves with their idols: 

{20:19} I [am] the LORD your God;walk in my statutes, and keep my judgments, and do them; 

{20:20} Andhallow my sabbaths; and they shall be a sign between me and you, thatye may know that I [am] the LORD your God. 

{20:21} Notwithstanding thechildren rebelled against me: they walked not in my statutes, neitherkept my judgments to do them, which [if] a man do, he shall even livein them; they polluted my sabbaths: then I said, I would pour out myfury upon them, to accomplish my anger against them in the wilderness.

{20:22} Nevertheless I withdrew mine hand, and wrought for my name'ssake, that it should not be polluted in the sight of the heathen, inwhose sight I brought them forth. 

{20:23} I lifted up mine hand untothem also in the wilderness, that I would scatter them among theheathen, and disperse them through the countries; 

{20:24} Because theyhad not executed my judgments, but had despised my statutes, and hadpolluted my sabbaths, and their eyes were after their fathers' idols.

{20:25} Wherefore I gave them also statutes [that were] not good, andjudgments whereby they should not live; 

{20:26} And I polluted them intheir own gifts, in that they caused to pass through [the fire] allthat openeth the womb, that I might make them desolate, to the end thatthey might know that I [am] the LORD.   

{20:27} Therefore, son of man, speak unto the house of Israel, andsay unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Yet in this your fathers haveblasphemed me, in that they have committed a trespass against me.

{20:28} [For] when I had brought them into the land, [for] the which Ilifted up mine hand to give it to them, then they saw every high hill,and all the thick trees, and they offered there their sacrifices, andthere they presented the provocation of their offering: there also theymade their sweet savour, and poured out there their drink offerings.

{20:29} Then I said unto them, What [is] the high place whereunto yego? And the name thereof is called Bamah unto this day. 

{20:30}Wherefore say unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Are yepolluted after the manner of your fathers? and commit ye whoredom aftertheir abominations? 

{20:31} For when ye offer your gifts, when ye makeyour sons to pass through the fire, ye pollute yourselves with all youridols, even unto this day: and shall I be enquired of by you, O houseof Israel? [As] I live, saith the Lord GOD, I will not be enquired ofby you. 

{20:32} And that which cometh into your mind shall not be atall, that ye say, We will be as the heathen, as the families of thecountries, to serve wood and stone.   

{20:33} [As] I live, saith the Lord GOD, surely with a mighty hand,and with a stretched out arm, and with fury poured out, will I ruleover you: 

{20:34} And I will bring you out from the people, and willgather you out of the countries wherein ye are scattered, with a mightyhand, and with a stretched out arm, and with fury poured out. 

{20:35}And I will bring you into the wilderness of the people, and there willI plead with you face to face. 

{20:36} Like as I pleaded with yourfathers in the wilderness of the land of Egypt, so will I plead withyou, saith the Lord GOD. 

{20:37} And I will cause you to pass under therod, and I will bring you into the bond of the covenant: 

{20:38} And Iwill purge out from among you the rebels, and them that transgressagainst me: I will bring them forth out of the country where theysojourn, and they shall not enter into the land of Israel: and ye shallknow that I [am] the LORD. 

{20:39} As for you, O house of Israel, thussaith the Lord GOD; Go ye, serve ye every one his idols, and hereafter[also,] if ye will not hearken unto me: but pollute ye my holy name nomore with your gifts, and with your idols. 

{20:40} For in mine holymountain, in the mountain of the height of Israel, saith the Lord GOD,there shall all the house of Israel, all of them in the land, serve me:there will I accept them, and there will I require your offerings, andthe firstfruits of your oblations, with all your holy things. 

{20:41} Iwill accept you with your sweet savour, when I bring you out from thepeople, and gather you out of the countries wherein ye have beenscattered; and I will be sanctified in you before the heathen. 

{20:42}And ye shall know that I [am] the LORD, when I shall bring you into theland of Israel, into the country [for] the which I lifted up mine handto give it to your fathers. 

{20:43} And there shall ye remember yourways, and all your doings, wherein ye have been defiled; and ye shalllothe yourselves in your own sight for all your evils that ye havecommitted. 

{20:44} And ye shall know that I [am] the LORD, when I havewrought with you for my name's sake, not according to your wicked ways,nor according to your corrupt doings, O ye house of Israel, saith theLord GOD.   

{20:45} Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 

{20:46}Son of man, set thy face toward the south, and drop [thy word] towardthe south, and prophesy against the forest of the south field; 

{20:47}And say to the forest of the south, Hear the word of the LORD; Thussaith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will kindle a fire in thee, and it shalldevour every green tree in thee, and every dry tree: the flaming flameshall not be quenched, and all faces from the south to the north shallbe burned therein. 

{20:48} And all flesh shall see that I the LORD havekindled it: it shall not be quenched. 

{20:49} Then said I, Ah Lord GOD!they say of me, Doth he not speak parables?   

{21:1} And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 

{21:2} Son ofman, set thy face toward Jerusalem, and drop [thy word] toward the holyplaces, and prophesy against the land of Israel, 

{21:3} And say to theland of Israel, Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I [am] against thee, andwill draw forth my sword out of his sheath, and will cut off from theethe righteous and the wicked. 

{21:4} Seeing then that I will cut offfrom thee the righteous and the wicked, therefore shall my sword goforth out of his sheath against all flesh from the south to the north:

{21:5} That all flesh may know that I the LORD have drawn forth mysword out of his sheath: it shall not return any more. 

{21:6} Sightherefore, thou son of man, with the breaking of [thy] loins; and withbitterness sigh before their eyes. 

{21:7} And it shall be, when theysay unto thee, Wherefore sighest thou? that thou shalt answer, For thetidings; because it cometh: and every heart shall melt, and all handsshall be feeble, and every spirit shall faint, and all knees shall beweak [as] water: behold, it cometh, and shall be brought to pass, saiththe Lord GOD.   

{21:8} Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 

{21:9} Sonof man, prophesy, and say, Thus saith the LORD; Say, A sword, a swordis sharpened, and also furbished: 

{21:10} It is sharpened to make asore slaughter; it is furbished that it may glitter: should we thenmake mirth? it contemneth the rod of my son, [as] every tree. 

{21:11}And he hath given it to be furbished, that it may be handled: thissword is sharpened, and it is furbished, to give it into the hand ofthe slayer. 

{21:12} Cry and howl, son of man: for it shall be upon mypeople, it [shall be] upon all the princes of Israel: terrors by reasonof the sword shall be upon my people: smite therefore upon [thy] thigh.

{21:13} Because [it is] a trial, and what if [the sword] contemn eventhe rod? it shall be no [more,] saith the Lord GOD. 

{21:14} Thoutherefore, son of man, prophesy, and smite [thine] hands together, andlet the sword be doubled the third time, the sword of the slain: it[is] the sword of the great [men that are] slain, which entereth intotheir privy chambers. 

{21:15} I have set the point of the sword againstall their gates, that [their] heart may faint, and [their] ruins bemultiplied: ah! [it is] made bright, [it is] wrapped up for theslaughter. 

{21:16} Go thee one way or other, [either] on the righthand, [or] on the left, whithersoever thy face [is] set. 

{21:17} I willalso smite mine hands together, and I will cause my fury to rest: I theLORD have said [it. ]

{21:18} The word of the LORD came unto me again,saying, 

{21:19} Also, thou son of man, appoint thee two ways, that thesword of the king of Babylon may come: both twain shall come forth outof one land: and choose thou a place, choose [it] at the head of theway to the city. 

{21:20} Appoint a way, that the sword may come toRabbath of the Ammonites, and to Judah in Jerusalem the defenced.

{21:21} For the king of Babylon stood at the parting of the way, at thehead of the two ways, to use divination: he made [his] arrows bright,he consulted with images, he looked in the liver. 

{21:22} At his righthand was the divination for Jerusalem, to appoint captains, to open themouth in the slaughter, to lift up the voice with shouting, to appoint[battering] rams against the gates, to cast a mount, [and] to build afort. 

{21:23} And it shall be unto them as a false divination in theirsight, to them that have sworn oaths: but he will call to remembrancethe iniquity, that they may be taken. 

{21:24} Therefore thus saith theLord GOD; Because ye have made your iniquity to be remembered, in thatyour transgressions are discovered, so that in all your doings yoursins do appear; because, [I say,] that ye are come to remembrance, yeshall be taken with the hand.   

{21:25} And thou, profane wicked prince of Israel, whose day iscome, when iniquity [shall have] an end, 

{21:26} Thus saith the LordGOD; Remove the diadem, and take off the crown: this [shall] not [be]the same: exalt [him that is] low, and abase [him that is] high.

{21:27} I will overturn, overturn, overturn, it: and it shall be no[more,] until he come whose right it is; and I will give it [him.]   

{21:28} And thou, son of man, prophesy and say, Thus saith the LordGOD concerning the Ammonites, and concerning their reproach; even saythou, The sword, the sword [is] drawn: for the slaughter [it is]furbished, to consume because of the glittering: 

{21:29} Whiles theysee vanity unto thee, whiles they divine a lie unto thee, to bring theeupon the necks of [them that are] slain, of the wicked, whose day iscome, when their iniquity [shall have] an end. 

{21:30} Shall I cause[it] to return into his sheath? I will judge thee in the place wherethou wast created, in the land of thy nativity. 

{21:31} And I will pourout mine indignation upon thee, I will blow against thee in the fire ofmy wrath, and deliver thee into the hand of brutish men, [and] skilfulto destroy. 

{21:32} Thou shalt be for fuel to the fire; thy blood shallbe in the midst of the land; thou shalt be no [more] remembered: for Ithe LORD have spoken [it.]   

{22:1} Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 

{22:2}Now, thou son of man, wilt thou judge, wilt thou judge the bloody city?yea, thou shalt shew her all her abominations. 

{22:3} Then say thou,Thus saith the Lord GOD, The city sheddeth blood in the midst of it,that her time may come, and maketh idols against herself to defileherself. 

{22:4} Thou art become guilty in thy blood that thou hastshed; and hast defiled thyself in thine idols which thou hast made; andthou hast caused thy days to draw near, and art come [even] unto thyyears: therefore have I made thee a reproach unto the heathen, and amocking to all countries. 

{22:5} [Those that be] near, and [those thatbe] far from thee, shall mock thee, [which art] infamous [and] muchvexed. 

{22:6} Behold, the princes of Israel, every one were in thee totheir power to shed blood. 

{22:7} In thee have they set light by fatherand mother: in the midst of thee have they dealt by oppression with thestranger: in thee have they vexed the fatherless and the widow. 

{22:8}Thou hast despised mine holy things, and hast profaned my sabbaths.

{22:9} In thee are men that carry tales to shed blood: and in thee theyeat upon the mountains: in the midst of thee they commit lewdness.

{22:10} In thee have they discovered their fathers' nakedness: in theehave they humbled her that was set apart for pollution. 

{22:11} And onehath committed abomination with his neighbour's wife; and another hathlewdly defiled his daughter in law; and another in thee hath humbledhis sister, his father's daughter. 

{22:12} In thee have they takengifts to shed blood; thou hast taken usury and increase, and thou hastgreedily gained of thy neighbours by extortion, and hast forgotten me,saith the Lord GOD.   

{22:13} Behold, therefore I have smitten mine hand at thy dishonestgain which thou hast made, and at thy blood which hath been in themidst of thee. 

{22:14} Can thine heart endure, or can thine hands bestrong, in the days that I shall deal with thee? I the LORD have spoken[it,] and will do [it. ]

{22:15} And I will scatter thee among theheathen, and disperse thee in the countries, and will consume thyfilthiness out of thee. 

{22:16} And thou shalt take thine inheritancein thyself in the sight of the heathen, and thou shalt know that I [am]the LORD. 

{22:17} And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

{22:18} Son of man, the house of Israel is to me become dross: all they[are] brass, and tin, and iron, and lead, in the midst of the furnace;they are [even] the dross of silver. 

{22:19} Therefore thus saith theLord GOD; Because ye are all become dross, behold, therefore I willgather you into the midst of Jerusalem. 

{22:20} [As] they gathersilver, and brass, and iron, and lead, and tin, into the midst of thefurnace, to blow the fire upon it, to melt [it;] so will I gather [you]in mine anger and in my fury, and I will leave [you there,] and meltyou. 

{22:21} Yea, I will gather you, and blow upon you in the fire ofmy wrath, and ye shall be melted in the midst thereof. 

{22:22} Assilver is melted in the midst of the furnace, so shall ye be melted inthe midst thereof; and ye shall know that I the LORD have poured out myfury upon you.   

{22:23} And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 

{22:24} Sonof man, say unto her, Thou [art] the land that is not cleansed, norrained upon in the day of indignation. 

{22:25} [There is] a conspiracyof her prophets in the midst thereof, like a roaring lion ravening theprey; they have devoured souls; they have taken the treasure andprecious things; they have made her many widows in the midst thereof.

{22:26} Her priests have violated my law, and have profaned mine holythings: they have put no difference between the holy and profane,neither have they shewed [difference] between the unclean and theclean, and have hid their eyes from my sabbaths, and I am profanedamong them. 

{22:27} Her princes in the midst thereof [are] like wolvesravening the prey, to shed blood, [and] to destroy souls, to getdishonest gain. 

{22:28} And her prophets have daubed them withuntempered [morter,] seeing vanity, and divining lies unto them,saying, Thus saith the Lord GOD, when the LORD hath not spoken. 

{22:29}The people of the land have used oppression, and exercised robbery, andhave vexed the poor and needy: yea, they have oppressed the strangerwrongfully. 

{22:30} And I sought for a man among them, that should makeup the hedge, and stand in the gap before me for the land, that Ishould not destroy it: but I found none. 

{22:31} Therefore have Ipoured out mine indignation upon them; I have consumed them with thefire of my wrath: their own way have I recompensed upon their heads,saith the Lord GOD.   

{23:1} The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying, 

{23:2} Sonof man, there were two women, the daughters of one mother: 

{23:3} Andthey committed whoredoms in Egypt; they committed whoredoms in theiryouth: there were their breasts pressed, and there they bruised theteats of their virginity. 

{23:4} And the names of them [were] Aholahthe elder, and Aholibah her sister: and they were mine, and they baresons and daughters. Thus [were] their names; Samaria [is] Aholah, andJerusalem Aholibah. 

{23:5} And Aholah played the harlot when she wasmine; and she doted on her lovers, on the Assyrians [her] neighbours,

{23:6} [Which were] clothed with blue, captains and rulers, all of themdesirable young men, horsemen riding upon horses. 

{23:7} Thus shecommitted her whoredoms with them, with all them [that were] the chosenmen of Assyria, and with all on whom she doted: with all their idolsshe defiled herself. 

{23:8} Neither left she her whoredoms [brought]from Egypt: for in her youth they lay with her, and they bruised thebreasts of her virginity, and poured their whoredom upon her. 

{23:9}Wherefore I have delivered her into the hand of her lovers, into thehand of the Assyrians, upon whom she doted. 

{23:10} These discoveredher nakedness: they took her sons and her daughters, and slew her withthe sword: and she became famous among women; for they had executedjudgment upon her. 

{23:11} And when her sister Aholibah saw [this,] shewas more corrupt in her inordinate love than she, and in her whoredomsmore than her sister in [her] whoredoms. 

{23:12} She doted upon theAssyrians [her] neighbours, captains and rulers clothed mostgorgeously, horsemen riding upon horses, all of them desirable youngmen. 

{23:13} Then I saw that she was defiled, [that] they [took] bothone way, 

{23:14} And [that] she increased her whoredoms: for when shesaw men pourtrayed upon the wall, the images of the Chaldeanspourtrayed with vermilion, 

{23:15} Girded with girdles upon theirloins, exceeding in dyed attire upon their heads, all of them princesto look to, after the manner of the Babylonians of Chaldea, the land oftheir nativity: 

{23:16} And as soon as she saw them with her eyes, shedoted upon them, and sent messengers unto them into Chaldea. 

{23:17}And the Babylonians came to her into the bed of love, and they defiledher with their whoredom, and she was polluted with them, and her mindwas alienated from them. 

{23:18} So she discovered her whoredoms, anddiscovered her nakedness: then my mind was alienated from her, like asmy mind was alienated from her sister. 

{23:19} Yet she multiplied herwhoredoms, in calling to remembrance the days of her youth, wherein shehad played the harlot in the land of Egypt. 

{23:20} For she doted upontheir paramours, whose flesh [is as] the flesh of asses, and whoseissue [is like] the issue of horses. 

{23:21} Thus thou calledst toremembrance the lewdness of thy youth, in bruising thy teats by theEgyptians for the paps of thy youth.   

{23:22} Therefore, O Aholibah, thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, Iwill raise up thy lovers against thee, from whom thy mind is alienated,and I will bring them against thee on every side; 

{23:23} TheBabylonians, and all the Chaldeans, Pekod, and Shoa, and Koa, [and] allthe Assyrians with them: all of them desirable young men, captains andrulers, great lords and renowned, all of them riding upon horses.

{23:24} And they shall come against thee with chariots, wagons, andwheels, and with an assembly of people, [which] shall set against theebuckler and shield and helmet round about: and I will set judgmentbefore them, and they shall judge thee according to their judgments.

{23:25} And I will set my jealousy against thee, and they shall dealfuriously with thee: they shall take away thy nose and thine ears; andthy remnant shall fall by the sword: they shall take thy sons and thydaughters; and thy residue shall be devoured by the fire. 

{23:26} Theyshall also strip thee out of thy clothes, and take away thy fairjewels. 

{23:27} Thus will I make thy lewdness to cease from thee, andthy whoredom [brought] from the land of Egypt: so that thou shalt notlift up thine eyes unto them, nor remember Egypt any more. 

{23:28} Forthus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will deliver thee into the hand [ofthem] whom thou hatest, into the hand [of them] from whom thy mind isalienated: 

{23:29} And they shall deal with thee hatefully, and shalltake away all thy labour, and shall leave thee naked and bare: and thenakedness of thy whoredoms shall be discovered, both thy lewdness andthy whoredoms. 

{23:30} I will do these [things] unto thee, because thouhast gone a whoring after the heathen, [and] because thou art pollutedwith their idols. 

{23:31} Thou hast walked in the way of thy sister;therefore will I give her cup into thine hand. 

{23:32} Thus saith theLord GOD; Thou shalt drink of thy sister's cup deep and large: thoushalt be laughed to scorn and had in derision; it containeth much.

{23:33} Thou shalt be filled with drunkenness and sorrow, with the cupof astonishment and desolation, with the cup of thy sister Samaria.

{23:34} Thou shalt even drink it and suck [it] out, and thou shaltbreak the sherds thereof, and pluck off thine own breasts: for I havespoken [it,] saith the Lord GOD. 

{23:35} Therefore thus saith the LordGOD; Because thou hast forgotten me, and cast me behind thy back,therefore bear thou also thy lewdness and thy whoredoms.   

{23:36} The LORD said moreover unto me; Son of man, wilt thou judgeAholah and Aholibah? yea, declare unto them their abominations; 

{23:37}That they have committed adultery, and blood is in their hands, andwith their idols have they committed adultery, and have also causedtheir sons, whom they bare unto me, to pass for them through [thefire,] to devour [them. ]

{23:38} Moreover this they have done unto me:they have defiled my sanctuary in the same day, and have profaned mysabbaths. 

{23:39} For when they had slain their children to theiridols, then they came the same day into my sanctuary to profane it;and, lo, thus have they done in the midst of mine house. 

{23:40} Andfurthermore, that ye have sent for men to come from far, unto whom amessenger [was] sent; and, lo, they came: for whom thou didst washthyself, paintedst thy eyes, and deckedst thyself with ornaments,

{23:41} And satest upon a stately bed, and a table prepared before it,whereupon thou hast set mine incense and mine oil. 

{23:42} And a voiceof a multitude being at ease [was] with her: and with the men of thecommon sort [were] brought Sabeans from the wilderness, which putbracelets upon their hands, and beautiful crowns upon their heads.

{23:43} Then said I unto [her that was] old in adulteries, Will theynow commit whoredoms with her, and she [with them? ]

{23:44} Yet theywent in unto her, as they go in unto a woman that playeth the harlot:so went they in unto Aholah and unto Aholibah, the lewd women.   

{23:45} And the righteous men, they shall judge them after themanner of adulteresses, and after the manner of women that shed blood;because they [are] adulteresses, and blood [is] in their hands. 

{23:46}For thus saith the Lord GOD; I will bring up a company upon them, andwill give them to be removed and spoiled. 

{23:47} And the company shallstone them with stones, and dispatch them with their swords; they shallslay their sons and their daughters, and burn up their houses withfire. 

{23:48} Thus will I cause lewdness to cease out of the land, thatall women may be taught not to do after your lewdness. 

{23:49} And theyshall recompense your lewdness upon you, and ye shall bear the sins ofyour idols: and ye shall know that I [am] the Lord GOD.   

{24:1} Again in the ninth year, in the tenth month, in the tenth[day] of the month, the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 

{24:2}Son of man, write thee the name of the day, [even] of this same day:the king of Babylon set himself against Jerusalem this same day. 

{24:3}And utter a parable unto the rebellious house, and say unto them, Thussaith the Lord GOD; Set on a pot, set [it] on, and also pour water intoit: 

{24:4} Gather the pieces thereof into it, [even] every good piece,the thigh, and the shoulder; fill [it] with the choice bones. 

{24:5}Take the choice of the flock, and burn also the bones under it, [and]make it boil well, and let them seethe the bones of it therein.   

{24:6} Wherefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Woe to the bloody city, tothe pot whose scum is therein, and whose scum [is] not gone out of it!bring it out piece by piece; let no lot fall up on it. 

{24:7} For herblood is in the midst of her; she set it upon the top of a rock; shepoured it not upon the ground, to cover it with dust; 

{24:8} That itmight cause fury to come up to take vengeance; I have set her bloodupon the top of a rock, that it should not be covered. 

{24:9} Thereforethus saith the Lord GOD; Woe to the bloody city! I will even make thepile for fire great. 

{24:10} Heap on wood, kindle the fire, consume theflesh, and spice it well, and let the bones be burned. 

{24:11} Then setit empty upon the coals thereof, that the brass of it may be hot, andmay burn, and [that] the filthiness of it may be molten in it, [that]the scum of it may be consumed. 

{24:12} She hath wearied [herself] withlies, and her great scum went not forth out of her: her scum [shall be]in the fire. 

{24:13} In thy filthiness [is] lewdness: because I havepurged thee, and thou wast not purged, thou shalt not be purged fromthy filthiness any more, till I have caused my fury to rest upon thee.

{24:14} I the LORD have spoken [it:] it shall come to pass, and I willdo [it;] I will not go back, neither will I spare, neither will Irepent; according to thy ways, and according to thy doings, shall theyjudge thee, saith the Lord GOD.   

{24:15} Also the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 

{24:16} Sonof man, behold, I take away from thee the desire of thine eyes with astroke: yet neither shalt thou mourn nor weep, neither shall thy tearsrun down. 

{24:17} Forbear to cry, make no mourning for the dead, bindthe tire of thine head upon thee, and put on thy shoes upon thy feet,and cover not [thy] lips, and eat not the bread of men. 

{24:18} So Ispake unto the people in the morning: and at even my wife died; and Idid in the morning as I was commanded.   

{24:19} And the people said unto me, Wilt thou not tell us whatthese [things are] to us, that thou doest [so? ]

{24:20} Then I answeredthem, The word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 

{24:21} Speak unto thehouse of Israel, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will profane mysanctuary, the excellency of your strength, the desire of your eyes,and that which your soul pitieth; and your sons and your daughters whomye have left shall fall by the sword. 

{24:22} And ye shall do as I havedone: ye shall not cover [your] lips, nor eat the bread of men. 

{24:23}And your tires [shall be] upon your heads, and your shoes upon yourfeet: ye shall not mourn nor weep; but ye shall pine away for youriniquities, and mourn one toward another. 

{24:24} Thus Ezekiel is untoyou a sign: according to all that he hath done shall ye do: and whenthis cometh, ye shall know that I [am] the Lord GOD. 

{24:25} Also, thouson of man, [shall it] not [be] in the day when I take from them theirstrength, the joy of their glory, the desire of their eyes, and thatwhereupon they set their minds, their sons and their daughters, 

{24:26}[That] he that escapeth in that day shall come unto thee, to cause[thee] to hear [it] with [thine] ears? 

{24:27} In that day shall thymouth be opened to him which is escaped, and thou shalt speak, and beno more dumb: and thou shalt be a sign unto them; and they shall knowthat I [am] the LORD.   

{25:1} The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying, 

{25:2} Sonof man, set thy face against the Ammonites, and prophesy against them;

{25:3} And say unto the Ammonites, Hear the word of the Lord GOD; Thussaith the Lord GOD; Because thou saidst, Aha, against my sanctuary,when it was profaned; and against the land of Israel, when it wasdesolate; and against the house of Judah, when they went intocaptivity; 

{25:4} Behold, therefore I will deliver thee to the men ofthe east for a possession, and they shall set their palaces in thee,and make their dwellings in thee: they shall eat thy fruit, and theyshall drink thy milk. 

{25:5} And I will make Rabbah a stable forcamels, and the Ammonites a couchingplace for flocks: and ye shall knowthat I [am] the LORD. 

{25:6} For thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thouhast clapped [thine] hands, and stamped with the feet, and rejoiced inheart with all thy despite against the land of Israel; 

{25:7} Behold,therefore I will stretch out mine hand upon thee, and will deliver theefor a spoil to the heathen; and I will cut thee off from the people,and I will cause thee to perish out of the countries: I will destroythee; and thou shalt know that I [am] the LORD.   

{25:8} Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because that Moab and Seir do say,Behold, the house of Judah [is] like unto all the heathen; 

{25:9}Therefore, behold, I will open the side of Moab from the cities, fromhis cities [which are] on his frontiers, the glory of the country,Beth-jeshimoth, Baal-meon, and Kiriathaim, 

{25:10} Unto the men of theeast with the Ammonites, and will give them in possession, that theAmmonites may not be remembered among the nations. 

{25:11} And I willexecute judgments upon Moab; and they shall know that I [am] the LORD.   

{25:12} Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because that Edom hath dealtagainst the house of Judah by taking vengeance, and hath greatlyoffended, and revenged himself upon them; 

{25:13} Therefore thus saiththe Lord GOD; I will also stretch out mine hand upon Edom, and will cutoff man and beast from it; and I will make it desolate from Teman; andthey of Dedan shall fall by the sword. 

{25:14} And I will lay myvengeance upon Edom by the hand of my people Israel: and they shall doin Edom according to mine anger and according to my fury; and theyshall know my vengeance, saith the Lord GOD.   

{25:15} Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because the Philistines have dealtby revenge, and have taken vengeance with a despiteful heart, todestroy [it] for the old hatred; 

{25:16} Therefore thus saith the LordGOD; Behold, I will stretch out mine hand upon the Philistines, and Iwill cut off the Cherethims, and destroy the remnant of the sea coast.

{25:17} And I will execute great vengeance upon them with furiousrebukes; and they shall know that I [am] the LORD, when I shall lay myvengeance upon them.   

{26:1} And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the first [day]of the month, [that] the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 

{26:2}Son of man, because that Tyrus hath said against Jerusalem, Aha, she isbroken [that was] the gates of the people: she is turned unto me: Ishall be replenished, [now] she is laid waste: 

{26:3} Therefore thussaith the Lord GOD; Behold, I [am] against thee, O Tyrus, and willcause many nations to come up against thee, as the sea causeth hiswaves to come up. 

{26:4} And they shall destroy the walls of Tyrus, andbreak down her towers: I will also scrape her dust from her, and makeher like the top of a rock. 

{26:5} It shall be [a place for] thespreading of nets in the midst of the sea: for I have spoken [it,]saith the Lord GOD: and it shall become a spoil to the nations. 

{26:6}And her daughters which [are] in the field shall be slain by the sword;and they shall know that I [am] the LORD.   

{26:7} For thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will bring upon TyrusNebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, a king of kings, from the north, withhorses, and with chariots, and with horsemen, and companies, and muchpeople. 

{26:8} He shall slay with the sword thy daughters in the field:and he shall make a fort against thee, and cast a mount against thee,and lift up the buckler against thee. 

{26:9} And he shall set enginesof war against thy walls, and with his axes he shall break down thytowers. 

{26:10} By reason of the abundance of his horses their dustshall cover thee: thy walls shall shake at the noise of the horsemen,and of the wheels, and of the chariots, when he shall enter into thygates, as men enter into a city wherein is made a breach. 

{26:11} Withthe hoofs of his horses shall he tread down all thy streets: he shallslay thy people by the sword, and thy strong garrisons shall go down tothe ground. 

{26:12} And they shall make a spoil of thy riches, and makea prey of thy merchandise: and they shall break down thy walls, anddestroy thy pleasant houses: and they shall lay thy stones and thytimber and thy dust in the midst of the water. 

{26:13} And I will causethe noise of thy songs to cease; and the sound of thy harps shall be nomore heard. 

{26:14} And I will make thee like the top of a rock: thoushalt be [a place] to spread nets upon; thou shalt be built no more:for I the LORD have spoken [it,] saith the Lord GOD.   

{26:15} Thus saith the Lord GOD to Tyrus; Shall not the isles shakeat the sound of thy fall, when the wounded cry, when the slaughter ismade in the midst of thee? 

{26:16} Then all the princes of the seashall come down from their thrones, and lay away their robes, and putoff their broidered garments: they shall clothe themselves withtrembling; they shall sit upon the ground, and shall tremble at [every]moment, and be astonished at thee. 

{26:17} And they shall take up alamentation for thee, and say to thee, How art thou destroyed, [thatwast] inhabited of seafaring men, the renowned city, which wast strongin the sea, she and her inhabitants, which cause their terror [to be]on all that haunt it! 

{26:18} Now shall the isles tremble in the day ofthy fall; yea, the isles that [are] in the sea shall be troubled at thydeparture. 

{26:19} For thus saith the Lord GOD; When I shall make theea desolate city, like the cities that are not inhabited; when I shallbring up the deep upon thee, and great waters shall cover thee; 

{26:20}When I shall bring thee down with them that descend into the pit, withthe people of old time, and shall set thee in the low parts of theearth, in places desolate of old, with them that go down to the pit,that thou be not inhabited; and I shall set glory in the land of theliving; 

{26:21} I will make thee a terror, and thou [shalt be] no[more:] though thou be sought for, yet shalt thou never be found again,saith the Lord GOD.   

{27:1} The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying, 

{27:2} Now,thou son of man, take up a lamentation for Tyrus; 

{27:3} And say untoTyrus, O thou that art situate at the entry of the sea, [which art] amerchant of the people for many isles, Thus saith the Lord GOD; OTyrus, thou hast said, I [am] of perfect beauty. 

{27:4} Thy borders[are] in the midst of the seas, thy builders have perfected thy beauty.

{27:5} They have made all thy [ship] boards of fir trees of Senir: theyhave taken cedars from Lebanon to make masts for thee. 

{27:6} [Of] theoaks of Bashan have they made thine oars; the company of the Ashuriteshave made thy benches [of] ivory, [brought] out of the isles ofChittim. 

{27:7} Fine linen with broidered work from Egypt was thatwhich thou spreadest forth to be thy sail; blue and purple from theisles of Elishah was that which covered thee. 

{27:8} The inhabitants ofZidon and Arvad were thy mariners: thy wise [men,] O Tyrus, [that] werein thee, were thy pilots. 

{27:9} The ancients of Gebal and the wise[men] thereof were in thee thy calkers: all the ships of the sea withtheir mariners were in thee to occupy thy merchandise. 

{27:10} They ofPersia and of Lud and of Phut were in thine army, thy men of war: theyhanged the shield and helmet in thee; they set forth thy comeliness.

{27:11} The men of Arvad with thine army [were] upon thy walls roundabout, and the Gammadims were in thy towers: they hanged their shieldsupon thy walls round about; they have made thy beauty perfect. 

{27:12}Tarshish [was] thy merchant by reason of the multitude of all [kind of]riches; with silver, iron, tin, and lead, they traded in thy fairs.

{27:13} Javan, Tubal, and Meshech, they [were] thy merchants: theytraded the persons of men and vessels of brass in thy market. 

{27:14}They of the house of Togarmah traded in thy fairs with horses andhorsemen and mules. 

{27:15} The men of Dedan [were] thy merchants; manyisles [were] the merchandise of thine hand: they brought thee [for] apresent horns of ivory and ebony. 

{27:16} Syria [was] thy merchant byreason of the multitude of the wares of thy making: they occupied inthy fairs with emeralds, purple, and broidered work, and fine linen,and coral, and agate. 

{27:17} Judah, and the land of Israel, they[were] thy merchants: they traded in thy market wheat of Minnith, andPannag, and honey, and oil, and balm. 

{27:18} Damascus [was] thymerchant in the multitude of the wares of thy making, for the multitudeof all riches; in the wine of Helbon, and white wool. 

{27:19} Dan alsoand Javan going to and fro occupied in thy fairs: bright iron, cassia,and calamus, were in thy market. 

{27:20} Dedan [was] thy merchant inprecious clothes for chariots. 

{27:21} Arabia, and all the princes ofKedar, they occupied with thee in lambs, and rams, and goats: in these[were they] thy merchants. 

{27:22} The merchants of Sheba and Raamah,they [were] thy merchants: they occupied in thy fairs with chief of allspices, and with all precious stones, and gold. 

{27:23} Haran, andCanneh, and Eden, the merchants of Sheba, Asshur, [and] Chilmad, [were]thy merchants. 

{27:24} These [were] thy merchants in all sorts [ofthings,] in blue clothes, and broidered work, and in chests of richapparel, bound with cords, and made of cedar, among thy merchandise.

{27:25} The ships of Tarshish did sing of thee in thy market: and thouwast replenished, and made very glorious in the midst of the seas.

{27:26} Thy rowers have brought thee into great waters: the east windhath broken thee in the midst of the seas. 

{27:27} Thy riches, and thyfairs, thy merchandise, thy mariners, and thy pilots, thy calkers, andthe occupiers of thy merchandise, and all thy men of war, that [are] inthee, and in all thy company which [is] in the midst of thee, shallfall into the midst of the seas in the day of thy ruin. 

{27:28} Thesuburbs shall shake at the sound of the cry of thy pilots. 

{27:29} Andall that handle the oar, the mariners, [and] all the pilots of the sea,shall come down from their ships, they shall stand upon the land;

{27:30} And shall cause their voice to be heard against thee, and shallcry bitterly, and shall cast up dust upon their heads, they shallwallow themselves in the ashes: 

{27:31} And they shall make themselvesutterly bald for thee, and gird them with sackcloth, and they shallweep for thee with bitterness of heart [and] bitter wailing. 

{27:32}And in their wailing they shall take up a lamentation for thee, andlament over thee, [saying,] What [city is] like Tyrus, like thedestroyed in the midst of the sea? 

{27:33} When thy wares went forthout of the seas, thou filledst many people; thou didst enrich the kingsof the earth with the multitude of thy riches and of thy merchandise.

{27:34} In the time [when] thou shalt be broken by the seas in thedepths of the waters thy merchandise and all thy company in the midstof thee shall fall. 

{27:35} All the inhabitants of the isles shall beastonished at thee, and their kings shall be sore afraid, they shall betroubled in [their] countenance. 

{27:36} The merchants among the peopleshall hiss at thee; thou [shalt be] a terror, and never shalt be anymore.   

{28:1} The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying, 

{28:2} Sonof man, say unto the prince of Tyrus, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Becausethine heart [is] lifted up, and thou hast said, I [am] a God, I sit[in] the seat of God, in the midst of the seas; yet thou [art] a man,and not God, though thou set thine heart as the heart of God: 

{28:3}Behold, thou [art] wiser than Daniel; there is no secret that they canhide from thee: 

{28:4} With thy wisdom and with thine understandingthou hast gotten thee riches, and hast gotten gold and silver into thytreasures: 

{28:5} By thy great wisdom [and] by thy traffick hast thouincreased thy riches, and thine heart is lifted up because of thyriches: 

{28:6} Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thou hast setthine heart as the heart of God; 

{28:7} Behold, therefore I will bringstrangers upon thee, the terrible of the nations: and they shall drawtheir swords against the beauty of thy wisdom, and they shall defilethy brightness. 

{28:8} They shall bring thee down to the pit, and thoushalt die the deaths of [them that are] slain in the midst of the seas.

{28:9} Wilt thou yet say before him that slayeth thee, I [am] God? butthou [shalt be] a man, and no God, in the hand of him that slayeththee. 

{28:10} Thou shalt die the deaths of the uncircumcised by thehand of strangers: for I have spoken [it,] saith the Lord GOD. 

{28:11}Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 

{28:12} Son of man,take up a lamentation upon the king of Tyrus, and say unto him, Thussaith the Lord GOD; Thou sealest up the sum, full of wisdom, andperfect in beauty. 

{28:13} Thou hast been in Eden the garden of God;every precious stone [was] thy covering, the sardius, topaz, and thediamond, the beryl, the onyx, and the jasper, the sapphire, theemerald, and the carbuncle, and gold: the workmanship of thy tabretsand of thy pipes was prepared in thee in the day that thou wastcreated. 

{28:14} Thou [art] the anointed cherub that covereth; and Ihave set thee [so:] thou wast upon the holy mountain of God; thou hastwalked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire. 

{28:15} Thou[wast] perfect in thy ways from the day that thou wast created, tilliniquity was found in thee. 

{28:16} By the multitude of thy merchandisethey have filled the midst of thee with violence, and thou hast sinned:therefore I will cast thee as profane out of the mountain of God: and Iwill destroy thee, O covering cherub, from the midst of the stones offire. 

{28:17} Thine heart was lifted up because of thy beauty, thouhast corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness: I will cast theeto the ground, I will lay thee before kings, that they may behold thee.

{28:18} Thou hast defiled thy sanctuaries by the multitude of thineiniquities, by the iniquity of thy traffick; therefore will I bringforth a fire from the midst of thee, it shall devour thee, and I willbring thee to ashes upon the earth in the sight of all them that beholdthee. 

{28:19} All they that know thee among the people shall beastonished at thee: thou shalt be a terror, and never [shalt] thou [be]any more.   

{28:20} Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 

{28:21} Sonof man, set thy face against Zidon, and prophesy against it, 

{28:22}And say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I [am] against thee, O Zidon;and I will be glorified in the midst of thee: and they shall know thatI [am] the LORD, when I shall have executed judgments in her, and shallbe sanctified in her. 

{28:23} For I will send into her pestilence, andblood into her street; and the wounded shall be judged in the midst ofher by the sword upon her on every side; and they shall know that I[am] the LORD. 

{28:24} And there shall be no more a pricking brier untothe house of Israel, nor [any] grieving thorn of all [that are] roundabout them, that despised them; and they shall know that I [am] theLord GOD. 

{28:25} Thus saith the Lord GOD; When I shall have gatheredthe house of Israel from the people among whom they are scattered, andshall be sanctified in them in the sight of the heathen, then shallthey dwell in their land that I have given to my servant Jacob. 

{28:26}And they shall dwell safely therein, and shall build houses, and plantvineyards; yea, they shall dwell with confidence, when I have executedjudgments upon all those that despise them round about them; and theyshall know that I [am] the LORD their God.   

{29:1} In the tenth year, in the tenth [month,] in the twelfth [day]of the month, the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 

{29:2} Son ofman, set thy face against Pharaoh king of Egypt, and prophesy againsthim, and against all Egypt: 

{29:3} Speak, and say, Thus saith the LordGOD; Behold, I [am] against thee, Pharaoh king of Egypt, the greatdragon that lieth in the midst of his rivers, which hath said, My river[is] mine own, and I have made [it] for myself. 

{29:4} But I will puthooks in thy jaws, and I will cause the fish of thy rivers to stickunto thy scales, and I will bring thee up out of the midst of thyrivers, and all the fish of thy rivers shall stick unto thy scales.

{29:5} And I will leave thee [thrown] into the wilderness, thee and allthe fish of thy rivers: thou shalt fall upon the open fields; thoushalt not be brought together, nor gathered: I have given thee for meatto the beasts of the field and to the fowls of the heaven. 

{29:6} Andall the inhabitants of Egypt shall know that I [am] the LORD, becausethey have been a staff of reed to the house of Israel. 

{29:7} When theytook hold of thee by thy hand, thou didst break, and rend all theirshoulder: and when they leaned upon thee, thou brakest, and madest alltheir loins to be at a stand.   

{29:8} Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will bring asword upon thee, and cut off man and beast out of thee. 

{29:9} And theland of Egypt shall be desolate and waste; and they shall know that I[am] the LORD: because he hath said, The river [is] mine, and I havemade [it. ]

{29:10} Behold, therefore I [am] against thee, and againstthy rivers, and I will make the land of Egypt utterly waste [and]desolate, from the tower of Syene even unto the border of Ethiopia.

{29:11} No foot of man shall pass through it, nor foot of beast shallpass through it, neither shall it be inhabited forty years. 

{29:12} AndI will make the land of Egypt desolate in the midst of the countries[that are] desolate, and her cities among the cities [that are] laidwaste shall be desolate forty years: and I will scatter the Egyptiansamong the nations, and will disperse them through the countries.   

{29:13} Yet thus saith the Lord GOD; At the end of forty years willI gather the Egyptians from the people whither they were scattered:

{29:14} And I will bring again the captivity of Egypt, and will causethem to return [into] the land of Pathros, into the land of theirhabitation; and they shall be there a base kingdom. 

{29:15} It shall bethe basest of the kingdoms; neither shall it exalt itself any moreabove the nations: for I will diminish them, that they shall no morerule over the nations. 

{29:16} And it shall be no more the confidenceof the house of Israel, which bringeth [their] iniquity to remembrance,when they shall look after them: but they shall know that I [am] theLord GOD.   

{29:17} And it came to pass in the seven and twentieth year, in thefirst [month,] in the first [day] of the month, the word of the LORDcame unto me, saying, 

{29:18} Son of man, Nebuchadrezzar king ofBabylon caused his army to serve a great service against Tyrus: everyhead [was] made bald, and every shoulder [was] peeled: yet had he nowages, nor his army, for Tyrus, for the service that he had servedagainst it: 

{29:19} Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I willgive the land of Egypt unto Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon; and heshall take her multitude, and take her spoil, and take her prey; and itshall be the wages for his army. 

{29:20} I have given him the land ofEgypt [for] his labour wherewith he served against it, because theywrought for me, saith the Lord GOD.   

{29:21} In that day will I cause the horn of the house of Israel tobud forth, and I will give thee the opening of the mouth in the midstof them; and they shall know that I [am] the LORD.   

{30:1} The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying, 

{30:2} Sonof man, prophesy and say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Howl ye, Woe worththe day 

{30:3} For the day [is] near, even the day of the LORD [is]near, a cloudy day; it shall be the time of the heathen. 

{30:4} And thesword shall come upon Egypt, and great pain shall be in Ethiopia, whenthe slain shall fall in Egypt, and they shall take away her multitude,and her foundations shall be broken down. 

{30:5} Ethiopia, and Libya,and Lydia, and all the mingled people, and Chub, and the men of theland that is in league, shall fall with them by the sword. 

{30:6} Thussaith the LORD; They also that uphold Egypt shall fall; and the prideof her power shall come down: from the tower of Syene shall they fallin it by the sword, saith the Lord GOD. 

{30:7} And they shall bedesolate in the midst of the countries [that are] desolate, and hercities shall be in the midst of the cities [that are] wasted. 

{30:8}And they shall know that I [am] the LORD, when I have set a fire inEgypt, and [when] all her helpers shall be destroyed. 

{30:9} In thatday shall messengers go forth from me in ships to make the carelessEthiopians afraid, and great pain shall come upon them, as in the dayof Egypt: for, lo, it cometh. 

{30:10} Thus saith the Lord GOD; I willalso make the multitude of Egypt to cease by the hand of Nebuchadrezzarking of Babylon. 

{30:11} He and his people with him, the terrible ofthe nations, shall be brought to destroy the land: and they shall drawtheir swords against Egypt, and fill the land with the slain. 

{30:12}And I will make the rivers dry, and sell the land into the hand of thewicked: and I will make the land waste, and all that is therein, by thehand of strangers: I the LORD have spoken [it. ]

{30:13} Thus saith theLord GOD; I will also destroy the idols, and I will cause [their]images to cease out of Noph; and there shall be no more a prince of theland of Egypt: and I will put a fear in the land of Egypt. 

{30:14} AndI will make Pathros desolate, and will set fire in Zoan, and willexecute judgments in No. 

{30:15} And I will pour my fury upon Sin, thestrength of Egypt; and I will cut off the multitude of No. 

{30:16} AndI will set fire in Egypt: Sin shall have great pain, and No shall berent asunder, and Noph [shall have] distresses daily. 

{30:17} The youngmen of Aven and of Pi-beseth shall fall by the sword: and these[cities] shall go into captivity. 

{30:18} At Tehaphnehes also the dayshall be darkened, when I shall break there the yokes of Egypt: and thepomp of her strength shall cease in her: as for her, a cloud shallcover her, and her daughters shall go into captivity. 

{30:19} Thus willI execute judgments in Egypt: and they shall know that I [am] the LORD.   

{30:20} And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the first[month,] in the seventh [day] of the month, [that] the word of the LORDcame unto me, saying, 

{30:21} Son of man, I have broken the arm ofPharaoh king of Egypt; and, lo, it shall not be bound up to be healed,to put a roller to bind it, to make it strong to hold the sword.

{30:22} Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I [am] againstPharaoh king of Egypt, and will break his arms, the strong, and thatwhich was broken; and I will cause the sword to fall out of his hand.

{30:23} And I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and willdisperse them through the countries. 

{30:24} And I will strengthen thearms of the king of Babylon, and put my sword in his hand: but I willbreak Pharaoh's arms, and he shall groan before him with the groaningsof a deadly wounded [man. ]

{30:25} But I will strengthen the arms ofthe king of Babylon, and the arms of Pharaoh shall fall down; and theyshall know that I [am] the LORD, when I shall put my sword into thehand of the king of Babylon, and he shall stretch it out upon the landof Egypt. 

{30:26} And I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations,and disperse them among the countries; and they shall know that I [am]the LORD.   

{31:1} And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the third[month,] in the first [day] of the month, [that] the word of the LORDcame unto me, saying, 

{31:2} Son of man, speak unto Pharaoh king ofEgypt, and to his multitude; Whom art thou like in thy greatness?   

{31:3} Behold, the Assyrian [was] a cedar in Lebanon with fairbranches, and with a shadowing shroud, and of an high stature; and histop was among the thick boughs. 

{31:4} The waters made him great, thedeep set him up on high with her rivers running round about his plants,and sent out her little rivers unto all the trees of the field. 

{31:5}Therefore his height was exalted above all the trees of the field, andhis boughs were multiplied, and his branches became long because of themultitude of waters, when he shot forth. 

{31:6} All the fowls of heavenmade their nests in his boughs, and under his branches did all thebeasts of the field bring forth their young, and under his shadow dweltall great nations. 

{31:7} Thus was he fair in his greatness, in thelength of his branches: for his root was by great waters. 

{31:8} Thecedars in the garden of God could not hide him: the fir trees were notlike his boughs, and the chesnut trees were not like his branches; norany tree in the garden of God was like unto him in his beauty. 

{31:9} Ihave made him fair by the multitude of his branches: so that all thetrees of Eden, that [were] in the garden of God, envied him.   

{31:10} Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thou hast liftedup thyself in height, and he hath shot up his top among the thickboughs, and his heart is lifted up in his height; 

{31:11} I havetherefore delivered him into the hand of the mighty one of the heathen;he shall surely deal with him: I have driven him out for hiswickedness. 

{31:12} And strangers, the terrible of the nations, havecut him off, and have left him: upon the mountains and in all thevalleys his branches are fallen, and his boughs are broken by all therivers of the land; and all the people of the earth are gone down fromhis shadow, and have left him. 

{31:13} Upon his ruin shall all thefowls of the heaven remain, and all the beasts of the field shall beupon his branches: 

{31:14} To the end that none of all the trees by thewaters exalt themselves for their height, neither shoot up their topamong the thick boughs, neither their trees stand up in their height,all that drink water: for they are all delivered unto death, to thenether parts of the earth, in the midst of the children of men, withthem that go down to the pit. 

{31:15} Thus saith the Lord GOD; In theday when he went down to the grave I caused a mourning: I covered thedeep for him, and I restrained the floods thereof, and the great waterswere stayed: and I caused Lebanon to mourn for him, and all the treesof the field fainted for him. 

{31:16} I made the nations to shake atthe sound of his fall, when I cast him down to hell with them thatdescend into the pit: and all the trees of Eden, the choice and best ofLebanon, all that drink water, shall be comforted in the nether partsof the earth. 

{31:17} They also went down into hell with him unto [themthat be] slain with the sword; and [they that were] his arm, [that]dwelt under his shadow in the midst of the heathen.   

{31:18} To whom art thou thus like in glory and in greatness amongthe trees of Eden? yet shalt thou be brought down with the trees ofEden unto the nether parts of the earth: thou shalt lie in the midst ofthe uncircumcised with [them that be] slain by the sword. This [is]Pharaoh and all his multitude, saith the Lord GOD.   

{32:1} And it came to pass in the twelfth year, in the twelfthmonth, in the first [day] of the month, [that] the word of the LORDcame unto me, saying, 

{32:2} Son of man, take up a lamentation forPharaoh king of Egypt, and say unto him, Thou art like a young lion ofthe nations, and thou [art] as a whale in the seas: and thou camestforth with thy rivers, and troubledst the waters with thy feet, andfouledst their rivers. 

{32:3} Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will thereforespread out my net over thee with a company of many people; and theyshall bring thee up in my net. 

{32:4} Then will I leave thee upon theland, I will cast thee forth upon the open field, and will cause allthe fowls of the heaven to remain upon thee, and I will fill the beastsof the whole earth with thee. 

{32:5} And I will lay thy flesh upon themountains, and fill the valleys with thy height. 

{32:6} I will alsowater with thy blood the land wherein thou swimmest, [even] to themountains; and the rivers shall be full of thee. 

{32:7} And when Ishall put thee out, I will cover the heaven, and make the stars thereofdark; I will cover the sun with a cloud, and the moon shall not giveher light. 

{32:8} All the bright lights of heaven will I make dark overthee, and set darkness upon thy land, saith the Lord GOD. 

{32:9} I willalso vex the hearts of many people, when I shall bring thy destructionamong the nations, into the countries which thou hast not known.

{32:10} Yea, I will make many people amazed at thee, and their kingsshall be horribly afraid for thee, when I shall brandish my swordbefore them; and they shall tremble at [every] moment, every man forhis own life, in the day of thy fall.   

{32:11} For thus saith the Lord GOD; The sword of the king ofBabylon shall come upon thee. 

{32:12} By the swords of the mighty willI cause thy multitude to fall, the terrible of the nations, all ofthem: and they shall spoil the pomp of Egypt, and all the multitudethereof shall be destroyed. 

{32:13} I will destroy also all the beaststhereof from beside the great waters; neither shall the foot of mantrouble them any more, nor the hoofs of beasts trouble them. 

{32:14}Then will I make their waters deep, and cause their rivers to run likeoil, saith the Lord GOD. 

{32:15} When I shall make the land of Egyptdesolate, and the country shall be destitute of that whereof it wasfull, when I shall smite all them that dwell therein, then shall theyknow that I [am] the LORD. 

{32:16} This [is] the lamentation wherewiththey shall lament her: the daughters of the nations shall lament her:they shall lament for her, [even] for Egypt, and for all her multitude,saith the Lord GOD.   

{32:17} It came to pass also in the twelfth year, in the fifteenthday of the month, [that] the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

{32:18} Son of man, wail for the multitude of Egypt, and cast themdown, [even] her, and the daughters of the famous nations, unto thenether parts of the earth, with them that go down into the pit. 

{32:19}Whom dost thou pass in beauty? go down, and be thou laid with theuncircumcised. 

{32:20} They shall fall in the midst of [them that are]slain by the sword: she is delivered to the sword: draw her and all hermultitudes. 

{32:21} The strong among the mighty shall speak to him outof the midst of hell with them that help him: they are gone down, theylie uncircumcised, slain by the sword. 

{32:22} Asshur [is] there andall her company: his graves [are] about him: all of them slain, fallenby the sword: 

{32:23} Whose graves are set in the sides of the pit, andher company is round about her grave: all of them slain, fallen by thesword, which caused terror in the land of the living. 

{32:24} There[is] Elam and all her multitude round about her grave, all of themslain, fallen by the sword, which are gone down uncircumcised into thenether parts of the earth, which caused their terror in the land of theliving; yet have they borne their shame with them that go down to thepit. 

{32:25} They have set her a bed in the midst of the slain with allher multitude: her graves [are] round about him: all of themuncircumcised, slain by the sword: though their terror was caused inthe land of the living, yet have they borne their shame with them thatgo down to the pit: he is put in the midst of [them that be] slain.

{32:26} There [is] Meshech, Tubal, and all her multitude: her graves[are] round about him: all of them uncircumcised, slain by the sword,though they caused their terror in the land of the living. 

{32:27} Andthey shall not lie with the mighty [that are] fallen of theuncircumcised, which are gone down to hell with their weapons of war:and they have laid their swords under their heads, but their iniquitiesshall be upon their bones, though [they were] the terror of the mightyin the land of the living. 

{32:28} Yea, thou shalt be broken in themidst of the uncircumcised, and shalt lie with [them that are] slainwith the sword. 

{32:29} There [is] Edom, her kings, and all herprinces, which with their might are laid by [them that were] slain bythe sword: they shall lie with the uncircumcised, and with them that godown to the pit. 

{32:30} There [be] the princes of the north, all ofthem, and all the Zidonians, which are gone down with the slain; withtheir terror they are ashamed of their might; and they lieuncircumcised with [them that be] slain by the sword, and bear theirshame with them that go down to the pit. 

{32:31} Pharaoh shall seethem, and shall be comforted over all his multitude, [even] Pharaoh andall his army slain by the sword, saith the Lord GOD. 

{32:32} For I havecaused my terror in the land of the living: and he shall be laid in themidst of the uncircumcised with [them that are] slain with the sword,[even] Pharaoh and all his multitude, saith the Lord GOD.   

{33:1} Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 

{33:2} Sonof man, speak to the children of thy people, and say unto them, When Ibring the sword upon a land, if the people of the land take a man oftheir coasts, and set him for their watchman: 

{33:3} If when he seeththe sword come upon the land, he blow the trumpet, and warn the people;

{33:4} Then whosoever heareth the sound of the trumpet, and taketh notwarning; if the sword come, and take him away, his blood shall be uponhis own head. 

{33:5} He heard the sound of the trumpet, and took notwarning; his blood shall be upon him. But he that taketh warning shalldeliver his soul. 

{33:6} But if the watchman see the sword come, andblow not the trumpet, and the people be not warned; if the sword come,and take [any] person from among them, he is taken away in hisiniquity; but his blood will I require at the watchman's hand.   

{33:7} So thou, O son of man, I have set thee a watchman unto thehouse of Israel; therefore thou shalt hear the word at my mouth, andwarn them from me. 

{33:8} When I say unto the wicked, O wicked [man,]thou shalt surely die; if thou dost not speak to warn the wicked fromhis way, that wicked [man] shall die in his iniquity; but his bloodwill I require at thine hand. 

{33:9} Nevertheless, if thou warn thewicked of his way to turn from it; if he do not turn from his way, heshall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul. 

{33:10}Therefore, O thou son of man, speak unto the house of Israel; Thus yespeak, saying, If our transgressions and our sins [be] upon us, and wepine away in them, how should we then live? 

{33:11} Say unto them, [As]I live, saith the Lord GOD, I have no pleasure in the death of thewicked; but that the wicked turn from his way and live: turn ye, turnye from your evil ways; for why will ye die, O house of Israel? 

{33:12}Therefore, thou son of man, say unto the children of thy people, Therighteousness of the righteous shall not deliver him in the day of histransgression: as for the wickedness of the wicked, he shall not fallthereby in the day that he turneth from his wickedness; neither shallthe righteous be able to live for his [righteousness] in the day thathe sinneth. 

{33:13} When I shall say to the righteous, [that] he shallsurely live; if he trust to his own righteousness, and commit iniquity,all his righteousnesses shall not be remembered; but for his iniquitythat he hath committed, he shall die for it. 

{33:14} Again, when I sayunto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; if he turn from his sin, and dothat which is lawful and right; 

{33:15} [If] the wicked restore thepledge, give again that he had robbed, walk in the statutes of life,without committing iniquity; he shall surely live, he shall not die.

{33:16} None of his sins that he hath committed shall be mentioned untohim: he hath done that which is lawful and right; he shall surely live.   

{33:17} Yet the children of thy people say, The way of the Lord isnot equal: but as for them, their way is not equal. 

{33:18} When therighteous turneth from his righteousness, and committeth iniquity, heshall even die thereby. 

{33:19} But if the wicked turn from hiswickedness, and do that which is lawful and right, he shall livethereby.   

{33:20} Yet ye say, The way of the Lord is not equal. O ye house ofIsrael, I will judge you every one after his ways.   

{33:21} And it came to pass in the twelfth year of our captivity, inthe tenth [month,] in the fifth [day] of the month, [that] one that hadescaped out of Jerusalem came unto me, saying, The city is smitten.

{33:22} Now the hand of the LORD was upon me in the evening, afore hethat was escaped came; and had opened my mouth, until he came to me inthe morning; and my mouth was opened, and I was no more dumb. 

{33:23}Then the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 

{33:24} Son of man,they that inhabit those wastes of the land of Israel speak, saying,Abraham was one, and he inherited the land: but we [are] many; the landis given us for inheritance. 

{33:25} Wherefore say unto them, Thussaith the Lord GOD; Ye eat with the blood, and lift up your eyes towardyour idols, and shed blood: and shall ye possess the land? 

{33:26} Yestand upon your sword, ye work abomination, and ye defile every one hisneighbour's wife: and shall ye possess the land? 

{33:27} Say thou thusunto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; [As] I live, surely they that [are]in the wastes shall fall by the sword, and him that [is] in the openfield will I give to the beasts to be devoured, and they that be in theforts and in the caves shall die of the pestilence. 

{33:28} For I willlay the land most desolate, and the pomp of her strength shall cease;and the mountains of Israel shall be desolate, that none shall passthrough. 

{33:29} Then shall they know that I [am] the LORD, when I havelaid the land most desolate because of all their abominations whichthey have committed.   

{33:30} Also, thou son of man, the children of thy people still aretalking against thee by the walls and in the doors of the houses, andspeak one to another, every one to his brother, saying, Come, I prayyou, and hear what is the word that cometh forth from the LORD. 

{33:31}And they come unto thee as the people cometh, and they sit before theeas my people, and they hear thy words, but they will not do them: forwith their mouth they shew much love, [but] their heart goeth aftertheir covetousness. 

{33:32} And, lo, thou [art] unto them as a verylovely song of one that hath a pleasant voice, and can play well on aninstrument: for they hear thy words, but they do them not. 

{33:33} Andwhen this cometh to pass, (lo, it will come,) then shall they know thata prophet hath been among them.   

{34:1} And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 

{34:2} Son ofman, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel, prophesy, and say untothem, Thus saith the Lord GOD unto the shepherds; Woe [be] to theshepherds of Israel that do feed themselves! should not the shepherdsfeed the flocks? 

{34:3} Ye eat the fat, and ye clothe you with thewool, ye kill them that are fed: [but] ye feed not the flock. 

{34:4}The diseased have ye not strengthened, neither have ye healed thatwhich was sick, neither have ye bound up [that which was] broken,neither have ye brought again that which was driven away, neither haveye sought that which was lost; but with force and with cruelty have yeruled them. 

{34:5} And they were scattered, because [there is] noshepherd: and they became meat to all the beasts of the field, whenthey were scattered. 

{34:6} My sheep wandered through all themountains, and upon every high hill: yea, my flock was scattered uponall the face of the earth, and none did search or seek [after them.]   

{34:7} Therefore, ye shepherds, hear the word of the LORD; 

{34:8}[As] I live, saith the Lord GOD, surely because my flock became a prey,and my flock became meat to every beast of the field, because [therewas] no shepherd, neither did my shepherds search for my flock, but theshepherds fed themselves, and fed not my flock; 

{34:9} Therefore, O yeshepherds, hear the word of the LORD; 

{34:10} Thus saith the Lord GOD;Behold, I [am] against the shepherds; and I will require my flock attheir hand, and cause them to cease from feeding the flock; neithershall the shepherds feed themselves any more; for I will deliver myflock from their mouth, that they may not be meat for them.   

{34:11} For thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I, [even] I, will bothsearch my sheep, and seek them out. 

{34:12} As a shepherd seeketh outhis flock in the day that he is among his sheep [that are] scattered;so will I seek out my sheep, and will deliver them out of all placeswhere they have been scattered in the cloudy and dark day. 

{34:13} AndI will bring them out from the people, and gather them from thecountries, and will bring them to their own land, and feed them uponthe mountains of Israel by the rivers, and in all the inhabited placesof the country. 

{34:14} I will feed them in a good pasture, and uponthe high mountains of Israel shall their fold be: there shall they liein a good fold, and [in] a fat pasture shall they feed upon themountains of Israel. 

{34:15} I will feed my flock, and I will causethem to lie down, saith the Lord GOD. 

{34:16} I will seek that whichwas lost, and bring again that which was driven away, and will bind up[that which was] broken, and will strengthen that which was sick: but Iwill destroy the fat and the strong; I will feed them with judgment.

{34:17} And [as for] you, O my flock, thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold,I judge between cattle and cattle, between the rams and the he goats.

{34:18} [Seemeth it] a small thing unto you to have eaten up the goodpasture, but ye must tread down with your feet the residue of yourpastures? and to have drunk of the deep waters, but ye must foul theresidue with your feet? 

{34:19} And [as for] my flock, they eat thatwhich ye have trodden with your feet; and they drink that which ye havefouled with your feet.   

{34:20} Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD unto them; Behold, I,[even] I, will judge between the fat cattle and between the leancattle. 

{34:21} Because ye have thrust with side and with shoulder, andpushed all the diseased with your horns, till ye have scattered themabroad; 

{34:22} Therefore will I save my flock, and they shall no morebe a prey; and I will judge between cattle and cattle. 

{34:23} And Iwill set up one shepherd over them, and he shall feed them, [even] myservant David; he shall feed them, and he shall be their shepherd.

{34:24} And I the LORD will be their God, and my servant David a princeamong them; I the LORD have spoken [it. ]

{34:25} And I will make withthem a covenant of peace, and will cause the evil beasts to cease outof the land: and they shall dwell safely in the wilderness, and sleepin the woods. 

{34:26} And I will make them and the places round aboutmy hill a blessing; and I will cause the shower to come down in hisseason; there shall be showers of blessing. 

{34:27} And the tree of thefield shall yield her fruit, and the earth shall yield her increase,and they shall be safe in their land, and shall know that I [am] theLORD, when I have broken the bands of their yoke, and delivered themout of the hand of those that served themselves of them. 

{34:28} Andthey shall no more be a prey to the heathen, neither shall the beast ofthe land devour them; but they shall dwell safely, and none shall make[them] afraid. 

{34:29} And I will raise up for them a plant of renown,and they shall be no more consumed with hunger in the land, neitherbear the shame of the heathen any more. 

{34:30} Thus shall they knowthat I the LORD their God [am] with them, and [that] they, [even] thehouse of Israel, [are] my people, saith the Lord GOD. 

{34:31} And ye myflock, the flock of my pasture, [are] men, [and] I [am] your God, saiththe Lord GOD.   

{35:1} Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 

{35:2}Son of man, set thy face against mount Seir, and prophesy against it,

{35:3} And say unto it, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, O mount Seir,I [am] against thee, and I will stretch out mine hand against thee, andI will make thee most desolate. 

{35:4} I will lay thy cities waste, andthou shalt be desolate, and thou shalt know that I [am] the LORD.

{35:5} Because thou hast had a perpetual hatred, and hast shed [theblood of] the children of Israel by the force of the sword in the timeof their calamity, in the time [that their] iniquity [had] an end:

{35:6} Therefore, [as] I live, saith the Lord GOD, I will prepare theeunto blood, and blood shall pursue thee: sith thou hast not hatedblood, even blood shall pursue thee. 

{35:7} Thus will I make mount Seirmost desolate, and cut off from it him that passeth out and him thatreturneth. 

{35:8} And I will fill his mountains with his slain [men:]in thy hills, and in thy valleys, and in all thy rivers, shall theyfall that are slain with the sword. 

{35:9} I will make thee perpetualdesolations, and thy cities shall not return: and ye shall know that I[am] the LORD. 

{35:10} Because thou hast said, These two nations andthese two countries shall be mine, and we will possess it; whereas theLORD was there: 

{35:11} Therefore, as I live, saith the Lord GOD, Iwill even do according to thine anger, and according to thine envywhich thou hast used out of thy hatred against them; and I will makemyself known among them, when I have judged thee. 

{35:12} And thoushalt know that I [am] the LORD, [and that] I have heard all thyblasphemies which thou hast spoken against the mountains of Israel,saying, They are laid desolate, they are given us to consume. 

{35:13}Thus with your mouth ye have boasted against me, and have multipliedyour words against me: I have heard [them. ]

{35:14} Thus saith the LordGOD; When the whole earth rejoiceth, I will make thee desolate. 

{35:15}As thou didst rejoice at the inheritance of the house of Israel,because it was desolate, so will I do unto thee: thou shalt bedesolate, O mount Seir, and all Idumea, [even] all of it: and theyshall know that I [am] the LORD.   

{36:1} Also, thou son of man, prophesy unto the mountains of Israel,and say, Ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the LORD: 

{36:2} Thussaith the Lord GOD; Because the enemy hath said against you, Aha, eventhe ancient high places are ours in possession: 

{36:3} Thereforeprophesy and say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because they have made [you]desolate, and swallowed you up on every side, that ye might be apossession unto the residue of the heathen, and ye are taken up in thelips of talkers, and [are] an infamy of the people: 

{36:4} Therefore,ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord GOD; Thus saith theLord GOD to the mountains, and to the hills, to the rivers, and to thevalleys, to the desolate wastes, and to the cities that are forsaken,which became a prey and derision to the residue of the heathen that[are] round about; 

{36:5} Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Surely inthe fire of my jealousy have I spoken against the residue of theheathen, and against all Idumea, which have appointed my land intotheir possession with the joy of all [their] heart, with despitefulminds, to cast it out for a prey. 

{36:6} Prophesy therefore concerningthe land of Israel, and say unto the mountains, and to the hills, tothe rivers, and to the valleys, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I havespoken in my jealousy and in my fury, because ye have borne the shameof the heathen: 

{36:7} Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; I have liftedup mine hand, Surely the heathen that [are] about you, they shall beartheir shame.   

{36:8} But ye, O mountains of Israel, ye shall shoot forth yourbranches, and yield your fruit to my people of Israel; for they are athand to come. 

{36:9} For, behold, I [am] for you, and I will turn untoyou, and ye shall be tilled and sown: 

{36:10} And I will multiply menupon you, all the house of Israel, [even] all of it: and the citiesshall be inhabited, and the wastes shall be builded: 

{36:11} And I willmultiply upon you man and beast; and they shall increase and bringfruit: and I will settle you after your old estates, and will do better[unto you] than at your beginnings: and ye shall know that I [am] theLORD. 

{36:12} Yea, I will cause men to walk upon you, [even] my peopleIsrael; and they shall possess thee, and thou shalt be theirinheritance, and thou shalt no more henceforth bereave them [of men.]

{36:13} Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because they say unto you, Thou[land] devourest up men, and hast bereaved thy nations; 

{36:14}Therefore thou shalt devour men no more, neither bereave thy nationsany more, saith the Lord GOD. 

{36:15} Neither will I cause [men] tohear in thee the shame of the heathen any more, neither shalt thou bearthe reproach of the people any more, neither shalt thou cause thynations to fall any more, saith the Lord GOD.   

{36:16} Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 

{36:17}Son of man, when the house of Israel dwelt in their own land, theydefiled it by their own way and by their doings: their way was beforeme as the uncleanness of a removed woman. 

{36:18} Wherefore I poured myfury upon them for the blood that they had shed upon the land, and fortheir idols [wherewith] they had polluted it: 

{36:19} And I scatteredthem among the heathen, and they were dispersed through the countries:according to their way and according to their doings I judged them.

{36:20} And when they entered unto the heathen, whither they went, theyprofaned my holy name, when they said to them, These [are] the peopleof the LORD, and are gone forth out of his land.   

{36:21} But I had pity for mine holy name, which the house of Israelhad profaned among the heathen, whither they went. 

{36:22} Thereforesay unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord GOD; I do not [this]for your sakes, O house of Israel, but for mine holy name's sake, whichye have profaned among the heathen, whither ye went. 

{36:23} And I willsanctify my great name, which was profaned among the heathen, which yehave profaned in the midst of them; and the heathen shall know that I[am] the LORD, saith the Lord GOD, when I shall be sanctified in youbefore their eyes. 

{36:24} For I will take you from among the heathen,and gather you out of all countries, and will bring you into your ownland.   

{36:25} Then will I sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall beclean: from all your filthiness, and from all your idols, will Icleanse you. 

{36:26} A new heart also will I give you, and a new spiritwill I put within you: and I will take away the stony heart out of yourflesh, and I will give you an heart of flesh. 

{36:27} And I will put myspirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes, and ye shallkeep my judgments, and do [them. ]

{36:28} And ye shall dwell in theland that I gave to your fathers; and ye shall be my people, and I willbe your God. 

{36:29} I will also save you from all your uncleannesses:and I will call for the corn, and will increase it, and lay no famineupon you. 

{36:30} And I will multiply the fruit of the tree, and theincrease of the field, that ye shall receive no more reproach of famineamong the heathen. 

{36:31} Then shall ye remember your own evil ways,and your doings that [were] not good, and shall lothe yourselves inyour own sight for your iniquities and for your abominations. 

{36:32}Not for your sakes do I [this,] saith the Lord GOD, be it known untoyou: be ashamed and confounded for your own ways, O house of Israel.

{36:33} Thus saith the Lord GOD; In the day that I shall have cleansedyou from all your iniquities I will also cause [you] to dwell in thecities, and the wastes shall be builded. 

{36:34} And the desolate landshall be tilled, whereas it lay desolate in the sight of all thatpassed by. 

{36:35} And they shall say, This land that was desolate isbecome like the garden of Eden; and the waste and desolate and ruinedcities [are become] fenced, [and] are inhabited. 

{36:36} Then theheathen that are left round about you shall know that I the LORD buildthe ruined [places, and] plant that that was desolate: I the LORD havespoken [it,] and I will do [it. ]

{36:37} Thus saith the Lord GOD; Iwill yet [for] this be enquired of by the house of Israel, to do [it]for them; I will increase them with men like a flock. 

{36:38} As theholy flock, as the flock of Jerusalem in her solemn feasts; so shallthe waste cities be filled with flocks of men: and they shall know thatI [am] the LORD.   

{37:1} The hand of the LORD was upon me, and carried me out in thespirit of the LORD, and set me down in the midst of the valley which[was] full of bones, 

{37:2} And caused me to pass by them round about:and, behold, [there were] very many in the open valley; and, lo, [theywere] very dry. 

{37:3} And he said unto me, Son of man, can these boneslive? And I answered, O Lord GOD, thou knowest. 

{37:4} Again he saidunto me, Prophesy upon these bones, and say unto them, O ye dry bones,hear the word of the LORD. 

{37:5} Thus saith the Lord GOD unto thesebones; Behold, I will cause breath to enter into you, and ye shalllive: 

{37:6} And I will lay sinews upon you, and will bring up fleshupon you, and cover you with skin, and put breath in you, and ye shalllive; and ye shall know that I [am] the LORD. 

{37:7} So I prophesied asI was commanded: and as I prophesied, there was a noise, and behold ashaking, and the bones came together, bone to his bone. 

{37:8} And whenI beheld, lo, the sinews and the flesh came up upon them, and the skincovered them above: but [there was ]no breath in them. 

{37:9} Then saidhe unto me, Prophesy unto the wind, prophesy, son of man, and say tothe wind, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Come from the four winds, O breath,and breathe upon these slain, that they may live. 

{37:10} So Iprophesied as he commanded me, and the breath came into them, and theylived, and stood up upon their feet, an exceeding great army.   

{37:11} Then he said unto me, Son of man, these bones are the wholehouse of Israel: behold, they say, Our bones are dried, and our hope islost: we are cut off for our parts. 

{37:12} Therefore prophesy and sayunto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, O my people, I will openyour graves, and cause you to come up out of your graves, and bring youinto the land of Israel. 

{37:13} And ye shall know that I [am] theLORD, when I have opened your graves, O my people, and brought you upout of your graves, 

{37:14} And shall put my spirit in you, and yeshall live, and I shall place you in your own land: then shall ye knowthat I the LORD have spoken [it,] and performed [it,] saith the LORD.   

{37:15} The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying, 

{37:16}Moreover, thou son of man, take thee one stick, and write upon it, ForJudah, and for the children of Israel his companions: then take anotherstick, and write upon it, For Joseph, the stick of Ephraim, and [for]all the house of Israel his companions: 

{37:17} And join them one toanother into one stick; and they shall become one in thine hand.   

{37:18} And when the children of thy people shall speak unto thee,saying, Wilt thou not shew us what thou [meanest] by these? 

{37:19} Sayunto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will take the stick ofJoseph, which [is] in the hand of Ephraim, and the tribes of Israel hisfellows, and will put them with him, [even] with the stick of Judah,and make them one stick, and they shall be one in mine hand.   

{37:20} And the sticks whereon thou writest shall be in thine handbefore their eyes. 

{37:21} And say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD;Behold, I will take the children of Israel from among the heathen,whither they be gone, and will gather them on every side, and bringthem into their own land: 

{37:22} And I will make them one nation inthe land upon the mountains of Israel; and one king shall be king tothem all: and they shall be no more two nations, neither shall they bedivided into two kingdoms any more at all: 

{37:23} Neither shall theydefile themselves any more with their idols, nor with their detestablethings, nor with any of their transgressions: but I will save them outof all their dwellingplaces, wherein they have sinned, and will cleansethem: so shall they be my people, and I will be their God. 

{37:24} AndDavid my servant [shall be] king over them; and they all shall have oneshepherd: they shall also walk in my judgments, and observe mystatutes, and do them. 

{37:25} And they shall dwell in the land that Ihave given unto Jacob my servant, wherein your fathers have dwelt; andthey shall dwell therein, [even] they, and their children, and theirchildren's children for ever: and my servant David [shall be] theirprince for ever. 

{37:26} Moreover I will make a covenant of peace withthem; it shall be an everlasting covenant with them: and I will placethem, and multiply them, and will set my sanctuary in the midst of themfor evermore. 

{37:27} My tabernacle also shall be with them: yea, Iwill be their God, and they shall be my people. 

{37:28} And the heathenshall know that I the LORD do sanctify Israel, when my sanctuary shallbe in the midst of them for evermore.   

{38:1} And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 

{38:2} Son ofman, set thy face against Gog, the land of Magog, the chief prince ofMeshech and Tubal, and prophesy against him, 

{38:3} And say, Thus saiththe Lord GOD; Behold I [am] against thee, O Gog, the chief prince ofMeshech and Tubal: 

{38:4} And I will turn thee back, and put hooks intothy jaws, and I will bring thee forth, and all thine army, horses andhorsemen, all of them clothed with all sorts [of armour, even] a greatcompany [with] bucklers and shields, all of them handling swords:

{38:5} Persia, Ethiopia, and Libya with them; all of them with shieldand helmet: 

{38:6} Gomer, and all his bands; the house of Togarmah ofthe north quarters, and all his bands: [and] many people with thee.

{38:7} Be thou prepared, and prepare for thyself, thou, and all thycompany that are assembled unto thee, and be thou a guard unto them.   

{38:8} After many days thou shalt be visited: in the latter yearsthou shalt come into the land [that is] brought back from the sword,[and is] gathered out of many people, against the mountains of Israel,which have been always waste: but it is brought forth out of thenations, and they shall dwell safely all of them. 

{38:9} Thou shaltascend and come like a storm, thou shalt be like a cloud to cover theland, thou, and all thy bands, and many people with thee. 

{38:10} Thussaith the Lord GOD; It shall also come to pass, [that] at the same timeshall things come into thy mind, and thou shalt think an evil thought:

{38:11} And thou shalt say, I will go up to the land of unwalledvillages; I will go to them that are at rest, that dwell safely, all ofthem dwelling without walls, and having neither bars nor gates, 

{38:12}To take a spoil, and to take a prey; to turn thine hand upon thedesolate places [that are now] inhabited, and upon the people [thatare] gathered out of the nations, which have gotten cattle and goods,that dwell in the midst of the land. 

{38:13} Sheba, and Dedan, and themerchants of Tarshish, with all the young lions thereof, shall say untothee, Art thou come to take a spoil? hast thou gathered thy company totake a prey? to carry away silver and gold, to take away cattle andgoods, to take a great spoil?   

{38:14} Therefore, son of man, prophesy and say unto Gog, Thus saiththe Lord GOD; In that day when my people of Israel dwelleth safely,shalt thou not know [it? ]

{38:15} And thou shalt come from thy placeout of the north parts, thou, and many people with thee, all of themriding upon horses, a great company, and a mighty army: 

{38:16} Andthou shalt come up against my people of Israel, as a cloud to cover theland; it shall be in the latter days, and I will bring thee against myland, that the heathen may know me, when I shall be sanctified in thee,O Gog, before their eyes. 

{38:17} Thus saith the Lord GOD; [Art] thouhe of whom I have spoken in old time by my servants the prophets ofIsrael, which prophesied in those days [many] years that I would bringthee against them? 

{38:18} And it shall come to pass at the same timewhen Gog shall come against the land of Israel, saith the Lord GOD,[that] my fury shall come up in my face. 

{38:19} For in my jealousy[and] in the fire of my wrath have I spoken, Surely in that day thereshall be a great shaking in the land of Israel; 

{38:20} So that thefishes of the sea, and the fowls of the heaven, and the beasts of thefield, and all creeping things that creep upon the earth, and all themen that [are] upon the face of the earth, shall shake at my presence,and the mountains shall be thrown down, and the steep places shallfall, and every wall shall fall to the ground. 

{38:21} And I will callfor a sword against him throughout all my mountains, saith the LordGOD: every man's sword shall be against his brother. 

{38:22} And I willplead against him with pestilence and with blood; and I will rain uponhim, and upon his bands, and upon the many people that [are] with him,an overflowing rain, and great hailstones, fire, and brimstone. 

{38:23}Thus will I magnify myself, and sanctify myself; and I will be known inthe eyes of many nations, and they shall know that I [am] the LORD.   

{39:1} Therefore, thou son of man, prophesy against Gog, and say,Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I [am] against thee, O Gog, the chiefprince of Meshech and Tubal: 

{39:2} And I will turn thee back, andleave but the sixth part of thee, and will cause thee to come up fromthe north parts, and will bring thee upon the mountains of Israel:

{39:3} And I will smite thy bow out of thy left hand, and will causethine arrows to fall out of thy right hand. 

{39:4} Thou shalt fall uponthe mountains of Israel, thou, and all thy bands, and the people that[is] with thee: I will give thee unto the ravenous birds of every sort,and [to] the beasts of the field to be devoured. 

{39:5} Thou shalt fallupon the open field: for I have spoken [it,] saith the Lord GOD. 

{39:6}And I will send a fire on Magog, and among them that dwell carelesslyin the isles: and they shall know that I [am] the LORD. 

{39:7} So willI make my holy name known in the midst of my people Israel; and I willnot [let them] pollute my holy name any more: and the heathen shallknow that I [am] the LORD, the Holy One in Israel.   

{39:8} Behold, it is come, and it is done, saith the Lord GOD; this[is] the day whereof I have spoken. 

{39:9} And they that dwell in thecities of Israel shall go forth, and shall set on fire and burn theweapons, both the shields and the bucklers, the bows and the arrows,and the handstaves, and the spears, and they shall burn them with fireseven years: 

{39:10} So that they shall take no wood out of the field,neither cut down [any] out of the forests; for they shall burn theweapons with fire: and they shall spoil those that spoiled them, androb those that robbed them, saith the Lord GOD.   

{39:11} And it shall come to pass in that day, [that] I will giveunto Gog a place there of graves in Israel, the valley of thepassengers on the east of the sea: and it shall stop the [noses] of thepassengers: and there shall they bury Gog and all his multitude: andthey shall call [it] The valley of Hamon-gog. 

{39:12} And seven monthsshall the house of Israel be burying of them, that they may cleanse theland. 

{39:13} Yea, all the people of the land shall bury [them;] and itshall be to them a renown the day that I shall be glorified, saith theLord GOD. 

{39:14} And they shall sever out men of continual employment,passing through the land to bury with the passengers those that remainupon the face of the earth, to cleanse it: after the end of sevenmonths shall they search. 

{39:15} And the passengers [that] passthrough the land, when [any] seeth a man's bone, then shall he set up asign by it, till the buriers have buried it in the valley of Hamon-gog.

{39:16} And also the name of the city [shall be] Hamonah. Thus shallthey cleanse the land.   

{39:17} And, thou son of man, thus saith the Lord GOD; Speak untoevery feathered fowl, and to every beast of the field, Assembleyourselves, and come; gather yourselves on every side to my sacrificethat I do sacrifice for you, [even] a great sacrifice upon themountains of Israel, that ye may eat flesh, and drink blood. 

{39:18} Yeshall eat the flesh of the mighty, and drink the blood of the princesof the earth, of rams, of lambs, and of goats, of bullocks, all of themfatlings of Bashan. 

{39:19} And ye shall eat fat till ye be full, anddrink blood till ye be drunken, of my sacrifice which I have sacrificedfor you. 

{39:20} Thus ye shall be filled at my table with horses andchariots, with mighty men, and with all men of war, saith the Lord GOD.

{39:21} And I will set my glory among the heathen, and all the heathenshall see my judgment that I have executed, and my hand that I havelaid upon them. 

{39:22} So the house of Israel shall know that I [am]the LORD their God from that day and forward.   

{39:23} And the heathen shall know that the house of Israel wentinto captivity for their iniquity: because they trespassed against me,therefore hid I my face from them, and gave them into the hand of theirenemies: so fell they all by the sword. 

{39:24} According to theiruncleanness and according to their transgressions have I done untothem, and hid my face from them. 

{39:25} Therefore thus saith the LordGOD; Now will I bring again the captivity of Jacob, and have mercy uponthe whole house of Israel, and will be jealous for my holy name;

{39:26} After that they have borne their shame, and all theirtrespasses whereby they have trespassed against me, when they dweltsafely in their land, and none made [them] afraid. 

{39:27} When I havebrought them again from the people, and gathered them out of theirenemies' lands, and am sanctified in them in the sight of many nations;

{39:28} Then shall they know that I [am] the LORD their God, whichcaused them to be led into captivity among the heathen: but I havegathered them unto their own land, and have left none of them any morethere. 

{39:29} Neither will I hide my face any more from them: for Ihave poured out my spirit upon the house of Israel, saith the Lord GOD.   

{40:1} In the five and twentieth year of our captivity, in thebeginning of the year, in the tenth [day] of the month, in thefourteenth year after that the city was smitten, in the selfsame daythe hand of the LORD was upon me, and brought me thither. 

{40:2} In thevisions of God brought he me into the land of Israel, and set me upon avery high mountain, by which [was] as the frame of a city on the south.

{40:3} And he brought me thither, and, behold, [there was] a man, whoseappearance was like the appearance of brass, with a line of flax in hishand, and a measuring reed; and he stood in the gate. 

{40:4} And theman said unto me, Son of man, behold with thine eyes, and hear withthine ears, and set thine heart upon all that I shall shew thee; for tothe intent that I might shew [them] unto thee [art] thou broughthither: declare all that thou seest to the house of Israel. 

{40:5} Andbehold a wall on the outside of the house round about, and in the man'shand a measuring reed of six cubits [long] by the cubit and an handbreadth: so he measured the breadth of the building, one reed; and theheight, one reed.   

{40:6} Then came he unto the gate which looketh toward the east, andwent up the stairs thereof, and measured the threshold of the gate,[which was] one reed broad; and the other threshold [of the gate, whichwas] one reed broad. 

{40:7} And [every] little chamber [was] one reedlong, and one reed broad; and between the little chambers [were] fivecubits; and the threshold of the gate by the porch of the gate within[was] one reed. 

{40:8} He measured also the porch of the gate within,one reed. 

{40:9} Then measured he the porch of the gate, eight cubits;and the posts thereof, two cubits; and the porch of the gate [was]inward. 

{40:10} And the little chambers of the gate eastward [were]three on this side, and three on that side; they three [were] of onemeasure: and the posts had one measure on this side and on that side.

{40:11} And he measured the breadth of the entry of the gate, tencubits; [and] the length of the gate, thirteen cubits. 

{40:12} Thespace also before the little chambers [was] one cubit [on this side,]and the space [was] one cubit on that side: and the little chambers[were] six cubits on this side, and six cubits on that side. 

{40:13} Hemeasured then the gate from the roof of [one] little chamber to theroof of another: the breadth [was] five and twenty cubits, door againstdoor. 

{40:14} He made also posts of threescore cubits, even unto thepost of the court round about the gate. 

{40:15} And from the face ofthe gate of the entrance unto the face of the porch of the inner gate[were] fifty cubits. 

{40:16} And [there were] narrow windows to thelittle chambers, and to their posts within the gate round about, andlikewise to the arches: and windows [were] round about inward: and upon[each] post [were] palm trees. 

{40:17} Then brought he me into theoutward court, and, lo, [there were] chambers, and a pavement made forthe court round about: thirty chambers [were] upon the pavement.

{40:18} And the pavement by the side of the gates over against thelength of the gates [was] the lower pavement. 

{40:19} Then he measuredthe breadth from the forefront of the lower gate unto the forefront ofthe inner court without, an hundred cubits eastward and northward.   

{40:20} And the gate of the outward court that looked toward thenorth, he measured the length thereof, and the breadth thereof. 

{40:21}And the little chambers thereof [were] three on this side and three onthat side; and the posts thereof and the arches thereof were after themeasure of the first gate: the length thereof [was] fifty cubits, andthe breadth five and twenty cubits. 

{40:22} And their windows, andtheir arches, and their palm trees, [were] after the measure of thegate that looketh toward the east; and they went up unto it by sevensteps; and the arches thereof [were] before them. 

{40:23} And the gateof the inner court [was] over against the gate toward the north, andtoward the east; and he measured from gate to gate an hundred cubits.   

{40:24} After that he brought me toward the south, and behold a gatetoward the south: and he measured the posts thereof and the archesthereof according to these measures. 

{40:25} And [there were] windowsin it and in the arches thereof round about, like those windows: thelength [was] fifty cubits, and the breadth five and twenty cubits.

{40:26} And [there were] seven steps to go up to it, and the archesthereof [were] before them: and it had palm trees, one on this side,and another on that side, upon the posts thereof. 

{40:27} And [therewas] a gate in the inner court toward the south: and he measured fromgate to gate toward the south an hundred cubits. 

{40:28} And he broughtme to the inner court by the south gate: and he measured the south gateaccording to these measures; 

{40:29} And the little chambers thereof,and the posts thereof, and the arches thereof, according to thesemeasures: and [there were] windows in it and in the arches thereofround about: [it was] fifty cubits long, and five and twenty cubitsbroad. 

{40:30} And the arches round about [were] five and twenty cubitslong, and five cubits broad. 

{40:31} And the arches thereof [were]toward the utter court; and palm trees [were] upon the posts thereof:and the going up to it [had] eight steps.   

{40:32} And he brought me into the inner court toward the east: andhe measured the gate according to these measures. 

{40:33} And thelittle chambers thereof, and the posts thereof, and the arches thereof,[were] according to these measures: and [there were] windows thereinand in the arches thereof round about: [it was] fifty cubits long, andfive and twenty cubits broad. 

{40:34} And the arches thereof [were]toward the outward court; and palm trees [were] upon the posts thereof,on this side, and on that side: and the going up to it [had] eightsteps. 

{40:35} And he brought me to the north gate, and measured [it]according to these measures; 

{40:36} The little chambers thereof, theposts thereof, and the arches thereof, and the windows to it roundabout: the length [was] fifty cubits, and the breadth five and twentycubits. 

{40:37} And the posts thereof [were] toward the utter court;and palm trees [were] upon the posts thereof, on this side, and on thatside: and the going up to it [had] eight steps. 

{40:38} And thechambers and the entries thereof [were] by the posts of the gates,where they washed the burnt offering.   

{40:39} And in the porch of the gate [were] two tables on this side,and two tables on that side, to slay thereon the burnt offering and thesin offering and the trespass offering. 

{40:40} And at the sidewithout, as one goeth up to the entry of the north gate, [were] twotables; and on the other side, which [was] at the porch of the gate,[were] two tables. 

{40:41} Four tables [were] on this side, and fourtables on that side, by the side of the gate; eight tables, whereuponthey slew [their sacrifices. ]

{40:42} And the four tables [were] ofhewn stone for the burnt offering, of a cubit and an half long, and acubit and an half broad, and one cubit high: whereupon also they laidthe instruments wherewith they slew the burnt offering and thesacrifice. 

{40:43} And within [were] hooks, an hand broad, fastenedround about: and upon the tables [was] the flesh of the offering.   

{40:44} And without the inner gate [were] the chambers of thesingers in the inner court, which [was] at the side of the north gate;and their prospect [was] toward the south: one at the side of the eastgate [having] the prospect toward the north. 

{40:45} And he said untome, This chamber, whose prospect [is] toward the south, [is] for thepriests, the keepers of the charge of the house. 

{40:46} And thechamber whose prospect [is] toward the north [is] for the priests, thekeepers of the charge of the altar: these [are] the sons of Zadok amongthe sons of Levi, which come near to the LORD to minister unto him.

{40:47} So he measured the court, an hundred cubits long, and anhundred cubits broad, foursquare; and the altar [that was] before thehouse.   

{40:48} And he brought me to the porch of the house, and measured[each] post of the porch, five cubits on this side, and five cubits onthat side: and the breadth of the gate [was] three cubits on this side,and three cubits on that side. 

{40:49} The length of the porch [was]twenty cubits, and the breadth eleven cubits; and [he brought me] bythe steps whereby they went up to it: and [there were] pillars by theposts, one on this side, and another on that side.   

{41:1} Afterward he brought me to the temple, and measured theposts, six cubits broad on the one side, and six cubits broad on theother side, [which was] the breadth of the tabernacle. 

{41:2} And thebreadth of the door [was] ten cubits; and the sides of the door [were]five cubits on the one side, and five cubits on the other side: and hemeasured the length thereof, forty cubits: and the breadth, twentycubits. 

{41:3} Then went he inward, and measured the post of the door,two cubits; and the door, six cubits; and the breadth of the door,seven cubits. 

{41:4} So he measured the length thereof, twenty cubits;and the breadth, twenty cubits, before the temple: and he said unto me,This [is] the most holy [place. ]

{41:5} After he measured the wall ofthe house, six cubits; and the breadth of [every] side chamber, fourcubits, round about the house on every side. 

{41:6} And the sidechambers [were] three, one over another, and thirty in order; and theyentered into the wall which [was] of the house for the side chambersround about, that they might have hold, but they had not hold in thewall of the house. 

{41:7} And [there was] an enlarging, and a windingabout still upward to the side chambers: for the winding about of thehouse went still upward round about the house: therefore the breadth ofthe house [was still] upward, and so increased [from] the lowest[chamber] to the highest by the midst. 

{41:8} I saw also the height ofthe house round about: the foundations of the side chambers [were] afull reed of six great cubits. 

{41:9} The thickness of the wall, which[was] for the side chamber without, [was] five cubits: and [that] which[was] left [was] the place of the side chambers that [were] within.

{41:10} And between the chambers [was] the wideness of twenty cubitsround about the house on every side. 

{41:11} And the doors of the sidechambers [were] toward [the place that was] left, one door toward thenorth, and another door toward the south: and the breadth of the placethat was left [was] five cubits round about. 

{41:12} Now the buildingthat [was] before the separate place at the end toward the west [was]seventy cubits broad; and the wall of the building [was] five cubitsthick round about, and the length thereof ninety cubits. 

{41:13} So hemeasured the house, an hundred cubits long; and the separate place, andthe building, with the walls thereof, an hundred cubits long; 

{41:14}Also the breadth of the face of the house, and of the separate placetoward the east, an hundred cubits. 

{41:15} And he measured the lengthof the building over against the separate place which [was] behind it,and the galleries thereof on the one side and on the other side, anhundred cubits, with the inner temple, and the porches of the court;

{41:16} The door posts, and the narrow windows, and the galleries roundabout on their three stories, over against the door, cieled with woodround about, and from the ground up to the windows, and the windows[were] covered; 

{41:17} To that above the door, even unto the innerhouse, and without, and by all the wall round about within and without,by measure. 

{41:18} And [it was] made with cherubims and palm trees, sothat a palm tree [was] between a cherub and a cherub; and [every]cherub had two faces; 

{41:19} So that the face of a man [was] towardthe palm tree on the one side, and the face of a young lion toward thepalm tree on the other side: [it was] made through all the house roundabout. 

{41:20} From the ground unto above the door [were] cherubims andpalm trees made, and [on] the wall of the temple. 

{41:21} The posts ofthe temple [were] squared, [and] the face of the sanctuary; theappearance [of the one] as the appearance [of the other. ]

{41:22} Thealtar of wood [was] three cubits high, and the length thereof twocubits; and the corners thereof, and the length thereof, and the wallsthereof, [were] of wood: and he said unto me, This [is] the table that[is] before the LORD. 

{41:23} And the temple and the sanctuary had twodoors. 

{41:24} And the doors had two leaves [apiece,] two turningleaves; two [leaves] for the one door, and two leaves for the other[door. ]

{41:25} And [there were] made on them, on the doors of thetemple, cherubims and palm trees, like as [were] made upon the walls;and [there were] thick planks upon the face of the porch without.

{41:26} And [there were] narrow windows and palm trees on the one sideand on the other side, on the sides of the porch, and [upon] the sidechambers of the house, and thick planks.   

{42:1} Then he brought me forth into the utter court, the way towardthe north: and he brought me into the chamber that [was] over againstthe separate place, and which [was] before the building toward thenorth. 

{42:2} Before the length of an hundred cubits [was] the northdoor, and the breadth [was] fifty cubits. 

{42:3} Over against thetwenty [cubits] which [were] for the inner court, and over against thepavement which [was] for the utter court, [was] gallery against galleryin three [stories. ]

{42:4} And before the chambers [was] a walk of tencubits breadth inward, a way of one cubit; and their doors toward thenorth. 

{42:5} Now the upper chambers [were] shorter: for the gallerieswere higher than these, than the lower, and than the middlemost of thebuilding. 

{42:6} For they [were] in three [stories,] but had notpillars as the pillars of the courts: therefore [the building] wasstraitened more than the lowest and the middlemost from the ground.

{42:7} And the wall that [was] without over against the chambers,toward the utter court on the forepart of the chambers, the lengththereof [was] fifty cubits. 

{42:8} For the length of the chambers that[were] in the utter court [was] fifty cubits: and, lo, before thetemple [were] an hundred cubits. 

{42:9} And from under these chambers[was] the entry on the east side, as one goeth into them from the uttercourt. 

{42:10} The chambers [were] in the thickness of the wall of thecourt toward the east, over against the separate place, and overagainst the building. 

{42:11} And the way before them [was] like theappearance of the chambers which [were] toward the north, as long asthey, [and] as broad as they: and all their goings out [were] bothaccording to their fashions, and according to their doors. 

{42:12} Andaccording to the doors of the chambers that [were] toward the south[was] a door in the head of the way, [even] the way directly before thewall toward the east, as one entereth into them.   

{42:13} Then said he unto me, The north chambers [and] the southchambers, which [are] before the separate place, they [be] holychambers, where the priests that approach unto the LORD shall eat themost holy things: there shall they lay the most holy things, and themeat offering, and the sin offering, and the trespass offering; for theplace [is] holy. 

{42:14} When the priests enter therein, then shallthey not go out of the holy [place] into the utter court, but therethey shall lay their garments wherein they minister; for they [are]holy; and shall put on other garments, and shall approach to [thosethings] which [are] for the people. 

{42:15} Now when he had made an endof measuring the inner house, he brought me forth toward the gate whoseprospect [is] toward the east, and measured it round about. 

{42:16} Hemeasured the east side with the measuring reed, five hundred reeds,with the measuring reed round about. 

{42:17} He measured the northside, five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed round about. 

{42:18}He measured the south side, five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed.   

{42:19} He turned about to the west side, [and] measured fivehundred reeds with the measuring reed. 

{42:20} He measured it by thefour sides: it had a wall round about, five hundred [reeds] long, andfive hundred broad, to make a separation between the sanctuary and theprofane place.   

{43:1} Afterward he brought me to the gate, [even] the gate thatlooketh toward the east: 

{43:2} And, behold, the glory of the God ofIsrael came from the way of the east: and his voice [was] like a noiseof many waters: and the earth shined with his glory. 

{43:3} And [itwas] according to the appearance of the vision which I saw, [even]according to the vision that I saw when I came to destroy the city: andthe visions [were] like the vision that I saw by the river Chebar; andI fell upon my face. 

{43:4} And the glory of the LORD came into thehouse by the way of the gate whose prospect [is] toward the east.

{43:5} So the spirit took me up, and brought me into the inner court;and, behold, the glory of the LORD filled the house. 

{43:6} And I heard[him] speaking unto me out of the house; and the man stood by me.   

{43:7} And he said unto me, Son of man, the place of my throne, andthe place of the soles of my feet, where I will dwell in the midst ofthe children of Israel for ever, and my holy name, shall the house ofIsrael no more defile, [neither] they, nor their kings, by theirwhoredom, nor by the carcases of their kings in their high places.

{43:8} In their setting of their threshold by my thresholds, and theirpost by my posts, and the wall between me and them, they have evendefiled my holy name by their abominations that they have committed:wherefore I have consumed them in mine anger. 

{43:9} Now let them putaway their whoredom, and the carcases of their kings, far from me, andI will dwell in the midst of them for ever.   

{43:10} Thou son of man, shew the house to the house of Israel, thatthey may be ashamed of their iniquities: and let them measure thepattern. 

{43:11} And if they be ashamed of all that they have done,shew them the form of the house, and the fashion thereof, and thegoings out thereof, and the comings in thereof, and all the formsthereof, and all the ordinances thereof, and all the forms thereof, andall the laws thereof: and write [it] in their sight, that they may keepthe whole form thereof, and all the ordinances thereof, and do them.

{43:12} This [is] the law of the house; Upon the top of the mountainthe whole limit thereof round about [shall be] most holy. Behold, this[is] the law of the house. 

{43:13} And these [are] the measures of thealtar after the cubits: The cubit [is] a cubit and an hand breadth;even the bottom [shall be] a cubit, and the breadth a cubit, and theborder thereof by the edge thereof round about [shall be] a span: andthis [shall be] the higher place of the altar. 

{43:14} And from thebottom [upon] the ground [even] to the lower settle [shall be] twocubits, and the breadth one cubit; and from the lesser settle [even] tothe greater settle [shall be] four cubits, and the breadth [one] cubit.

{43:15} So the altar [shall be] four cubits; and from the altar andupward [shall be] four horns. 

{43:16} And the altar [shall be] twelve[cubits] long, twelve broad, square in the four squares thereof.

{43:17} And the settle [shall be] fourteen [cubits] long and fourteenbroad in the four squares thereof; and the border about it [shall be]half a cubit; and the bottom thereof [shall be] a cubit about; and hisstairs shall look toward the east. 

{43:18} And he said unto me, Son ofman, thus saith the Lord GOD; These [are] the ordinances of the altarin the day when they shall make it, to offer burnt offerings thereon,and to sprinkle blood thereon. 

{43:19} And thou shalt give to thepriests the Levites that be of the seed of Zadok, which approach untome, to minister unto me, saith the Lord GOD, a young bullock for a sinoffering. 

{43:20} And thou shalt take of the blood thereof, and put[it] on the four horns of it, and on the four corners of the settle,and upon the border round about: thus shalt thou cleanse and purge it.

{43:21} Thou shalt take the bullock also of the sin offering, and heshall burn it in the appointed place of the house, without thesanctuary. 

{43:22} And on the second day thou shalt offer a kid of thegoats without blemish for a sin offering; and they shall cleanse thealtar, as they did cleanse [it] with the bullock. 

{43:23} When thouhast made an end of cleansing [it,] thou shalt offer a young bullockwithout blemish, and a ram out of the flock without blemish. 

{43:24}And thou shalt offer them before the LORD, and the priests shall castsalt upon them, and they shall offer them up [for] a burnt offeringunto the LORD. 

{43:25} Seven days shalt thou prepare every day a goat[for] a sin offering: they shall also prepare a young bullock, and aram out of the flock, without blemish. 

{43:26} Seven days shall theypurge the altar and purify it; and they shall consecrate themselves.

{43:27} And when these days are expired, it shall be, [that] upon theeighth day, and [so] forward, the priests shall make your burntofferings upon the altar, and your peace offerings; and I will acceptyou, saith the Lord GOD.   

{44:1} Then he brought me back the way of the gate of the outwardsanctuary which looketh toward the east; and it [was] shut. 

{44:2} Thensaid the LORD unto me; This gate shall be shut, it shall not be opened,and no man shall enter in by it; because the LORD, the God of Israel,hath entered in by it, therefore it shall be shut. 

{44:3} [It is] forthe prince; the prince, he shall sit in it to eat bread before theLORD; he shall enter by the way of the porch of [that] gate, and shallgo out by the way of the same.   

{44:4} Then brought he me the way of the north gate before thehouse: and I looked, and, behold, the glory of the LORD filled thehouse of the LORD: and I fell upon my face. 

{44:5} And the LORD saidunto me, Son of man, mark well, and behold with thine eyes, and hearwith thine ears all that I say unto thee concerning all the ordinancesof the house of the LORD, and all the laws thereof; and mark well theentering in of the house, with every going forth of the sanctuary.

{44:6} And thou shalt say to the rebellious, [even] to the house ofIsrael, Thus saith the Lord GOD; O ye house of Israel, let it sufficeyou of all your abominations, 

{44:7} In that ye have brought [into mysanctuary] strangers, uncircumcised in heart, and uncircumcised inflesh, to be in my sanctuary, to pollute it, [even] my house, when yeoffer my bread, the fat and the blood, and they have broken my covenantbecause of all your abominations. 

{44:8} And ye have not kept thecharge of mine holy things: but ye have set keepers of my charge in mysanctuary for yourselves.   

{44:9} Thus saith the Lord GOD; No stranger, uncircumcised in heart,nor uncircumcised in flesh, shall enter into my sanctuary, of anystranger that [is] among the children of Israel. 

{44:10} And theLevites that are gone away far from me, when Israel went astray, whichwent astray away from me after their idols; they shall even bear theiriniquity. 

{44:11} Yet they shall be ministers in my sanctuary, [having]charge at the gates of the house, and ministering to the house: theyshall slay the burnt offering and the sacrifice for the people, andthey shall stand before them to minister unto them. 

{44:12} Becausethey ministered unto them before their idols, and caused the house ofIsrael to fall into iniquity; therefore have I lifted up mine handagainst them, saith the Lord GOD, and they shall bear their iniquity.

{44:13} And they shall not come near unto me, to do the office of apriest unto me, nor to come near to any of my holy things, in the mostholy [place:] but they shall bear their shame, and their abominationswhich they have committed. 

{44:14} But I will make them keepers of thecharge of the house, for all the service thereof, and for all thatshall be done therein.   

{44:15} But the priests the Levites, the sons of Zadok, that keptthe charge of my sanctuary when the children of Israel went astray fromme, they shall come near to me to minister unto me, and they shallstand before me to offer unto me the fat and the blood, saith the LordGOD: 

{44:16} They shall enter into my sanctuary, and they shall comenear to my table, to minister unto me, and they shall keep my charge.   

{44:17} And it shall come to pass, [that] when they enter in at thegates of the inner court, they shall be clothed with linen garments;and no wool shall come upon them, whiles they minister in the gates ofthe inner court, and within. 

{44:18} They shall have linen bonnets upontheir heads, and shall have linen breeches upon their loins; they shallnot gird [themselves] with any thing that causeth sweat. 

{44:19} Andwhen they go forth into the utter court, [even] into the utter court tothe people, they shall put off their garments wherein they ministered,and lay them in the holy chambers, and they shall put on othergarments; and they shall not sanctify the people with their garments.

{44:20} Neither shall they shave their heads, nor suffer their locks togrow long; they shall only poll their heads. 

{44:21} Neither shall anypriest drink wine, when they enter into the inner court. 

{44:22}Neither shall they take for their wives a widow, nor her that is putaway: but they shall take maidens of the seed of the house of Israel,or a widow that had a priest before. 

{44:23} And they shall teach mypeople [the difference] between the holy and profane, and cause them todiscern between the unclean and the clean. 

{44:24} And in controversythey shall stand in judgment; [and] they shall judge it according to myjudgments: and they shall keep my laws and my statutes in all mineassemblies; and they shall hallow my sabbaths. 

{44:25} And they shallcome at no dead person to defile themselves: but for father, or formother, or for son, or for daughter, for brother, or for sister thathath had no husband, they may defile themselves. 

{44:26} And after heis cleansed, they shall reckon unto him seven days. 

{44:27} And in theday that he goeth into the sanctuary, unto the inner court, to ministerin the sanctuary, he shall offer his sin offering, saith the Lord GOD.

{44:28} And it shall be unto them for an inheritance: I [am] theirinheritance: and ye shall give them no possession in Israel: I [am]their possession. 

{44:29} They shall eat the meat offering, and the sinoffering, and the trespass offering; and every dedicated thing inIsrael shall be theirs. 

{44:30} And the first of all the firstfruits ofall [things,] and every oblation of all, of every [sort] of youroblations, shall be the priest's: ye shall also give unto the priestthe first of your dough, that he may cause the blessing to rest inthine house. 

{44:31} The priests shall not eat of any thing that isdead of itself, or torn, whether it be fowl or beast.   

{45:1} Moreover, when ye shall divide by lot the land forinheritance, ye shall offer an oblation unto the LORD, an holy portionof the land: the length [shall be] the length of five and twentythousand [reeds,] and the breadth [shall be] ten thousand. This [shallbe] holy in all the borders thereof round about. 

{45:2} Of this thereshall be for the sanctuary five hundred [in length,] with five hundred[in breadth,] square round about; and fifty cubits round about for thesuburbs thereof. 

{45:3} And of this measure shalt thou measure thelength of five and twenty thousand, and the breadth of ten thousand:and in it shall be the sanctuary [and] the most holy [place. ]

{45:4}The holy [portion] of the land shall be for the priests the ministersof the sanctuary, which shall come near to minister unto the LORD: andit shall be a place for their houses, and an holy place for thesanctuary. 

{45:5} And the five and twenty thousand of length, and theten thousand of breadth, shall also the Levites, the ministers of thehouse, have for themselves, for a possession for twenty chambers.   

{45:6} And ye shall appoint the possession of the city five thousandbroad, and five and twenty thousand long, over against the oblation ofthe holy [portion:] it shall be for the whole house of Israel.   

{45:7} And [a portion shall be] for the prince on the one side andon the other side of the oblation of the holy [portion,] and of thepossession of the city, before the oblation of the holy [portion,] andbefore the possession of the city, from the west side westward, andfrom the east side eastward: and the length [shall be] over against oneof the portions, from the west border unto the east border. 

{45:8} Inthe land shall be his possession in Israel: and my princes shall nomore oppress my people; and [the rest of] the land shall they give tothe house of Israel according to their tribes.   

{45:9} Thus saith the Lord GOD; Let it suffice you, O princes ofIsrael: remove violence and spoil, and execute judgment and justice,take away your exactions from my people, saith the Lord GOD. 

{45:10} Yeshall have just balances, and a just ephah, and a just bath. I 

{45:11}The ephah and the bath shall be of one measure, that the bath maycontain the tenth part of an homer, and the ephah the tenth part of anhomer: the measure thereof shall be after the homer. 

{45:12} And theshekel [shall be] twenty gerahs: twenty shekels, five and twentyshekels, fifteen shekels, shall be your maneh. 

{45:13} This [is] theoblation that ye shall offer; the sixth part of an ephah of an homer ofwheat, and ye shall give the sixth part of an ephah of an homer ofbarley: 

{45:14} Concerning the ordinance of oil, the bath of oil, [yeshall offer] the tenth part of a bath out of the cor, [which is] anhomer of ten baths; for ten baths [are] an homer: 

{45:15} And one lambout of the flock, out of two hundred, out of the fat pastures ofIsrael; for a meat offering, and for a burnt offering, and for peaceofferings, to make reconciliation for them, saith the Lord GOD. 

{45:16}All the people of the land shall give this oblation for the prince inIsrael. 

{45:17} And it shall be the prince's part [to give] burntofferings, and meat offerings, and drink offerings, in the feasts, andin the new moons, and in the sabbaths, in all solemnities of the houseof Israel: he shall prepare the sin offering, and the meat offering,and the burnt offering, and the peace offerings, to make reconciliationfor the house of Israel. 

{45:18} Thus saith the Lord GOD; In the first[month,] in the first [day] of the month, thou shalt take a youngbullock without blemish, and cleanse the sanctuary: 

{45:19} And thepriest shall take of the blood of the sin offering, and put [it] uponthe posts of the house, and upon the four corners of the settle of thealtar, and upon the posts of the gate of the inner court. 

{45:20} Andso thou shalt do the seventh [day] of the month for every one thaterreth, and for [him that is] simple: so shall ye reconcile the house.

{45:21} In the first [month,] in the fourteenth day of the month, yeshall have the passover, a feast of seven days; unleavened bread shallbe eaten. 

{45:22} And upon that day shall the prince prepare forhimself and for all the people of the land a bullock [for] a sinoffering. 

{45:23} And seven days of the feast he shall prepare a burntoffering to the LORD, seven bullocks and seven rams without blemishdaily the seven days; and a kid of the goats daily [for] a sinoffering. 

{45:24} And he shall prepare a meat offering of an ephah fora bullock, and an ephah for a ram, and an hin of oil for an ephah.

{45:25} In the seventh [month,] in the fifteenth day of the month,shall he do the like in the feast of the seven days, according to thesin offering, according to the burnt offering, and according to themeat offering, and according to the oil.   

{46:1} Thus saith the Lord GOD; The gate of the inner court thatlooketh toward the east shall be shut the six working days; but on thesabbath it shall be opened, and in the day of the new moon it shall beopened. 

{46:2} And the prince shall enter by the way of the porch of[that] gate without, and shall stand by the post of the gate, and thepriests shall prepare his burnt offering and his peace offerings, andhe shall worship at the threshold of the gate: then he shall go forth;but the gate shall not be shut until the evening. 

{46:3} Likewise thepeople of the land shall worship at the door of this gate before theLORD in the sabbaths and in the new moons. 

{46:4} And the burntoffering that the prince shall offer unto the LORD in the sabbath day[shall be] six lambs without blemish, and a ram without blemish. 

{46:5}And the meat offering [shall be] an ephah for a ram, and the meatoffering for the lambs as he shall be able to give, and an hin of oilto an ephah. 

{46:6} And in the day of the new moon [it shall be] ayoung bullock without blemish, and six lambs, and a ram: they shall bewithout blemish. 

{46:7} And he shall prepare a meat offering, an ephahfor a bullock, and an ephah for a ram, and for the lambs according ashis hand shall attain unto, and an hin of oil to an ephah. 

{46:8} Andwhen the prince shall enter, he shall go in by the way of the porch of[that] gate, and he shall go forth by the way thereof.   

{46:9} But when the people of the land shall come before the LORD inthe solemn feasts, he that entereth in by the way of the north gate toworship shall go out by the way of the south gate; and he that enterethby the way of the south gate shall go forth by the way of the northgate: he shall not return by the way of the gate whereby he came in,but shall go forth over against it. 

{46:10} And the prince in the midstof them, when they go in, shall go in; and when they go forth, shall goforth. 

{46:11} And in the feasts and in the solemnities the meatoffering shall be an ephah to a bullock, and ephah to a ram, and to thelambs as he is able to give, and an hin of oil to an ephah. 

{46:12} Nowwhen the prince shall prepare a voluntary burnt offering or peaceofferings voluntarily unto the LORD, [one] shall then open him the gatethat looketh toward the east, and he shall prepare his burnt offeringand his peace offerings, as he did on the sabbath day: then he shall goforth; and after his going forth [one] shall shut the gate. 

{46:13}Thou shalt daily prepare a burnt offering unto the LORD [of] a lamb ofthe first year without blemish: thou shalt prepare it every morning.

{46:14} And thou shalt prepare a meat offering for it every morning,the sixth part of an ephah, and the third part of an hin of oil, totemper with the fine flour; a meat offering continually by a perpetualordinance unto the LORD. 

{46:15} Thus shall they prepare the lamb, andthe meat offering, and the oil, every morning [for] a continual burntoffering.   

{46:16} Thus saith the Lord GOD; If the prince give a gift unto anyof his sons, the inheritance thereof shall be his sons'; it [shall be]their possession by inheritance. 

{46:17} But if he give a gift of hisinheritance to one of his servants, then it shall be his to the year ofliberty; after it shall return to the prince: but his inheritance shallbe his sons' for them. 

{46:18} Moreover the prince shall not take ofthe people's inheritance by oppression, to thrust them out of theirpossession; [but] he shall give his sons inheritance out of his ownpossession: that my people be not scattered every man from hispossession.   

{46:19} After he brought me through the entry, which [was] at theside of the gate, into the holy chambers of the priests, which lookedtoward the north: and, behold, there [was] a place on the two sideswestward. 

{46:20} Then said he unto me, This is the place where thepriests shall boil the trespass offering and the sin offering, wherethey shall bake the meat offering; that they bear [them] not out intothe utter court, to sanctify the people. 

{46:21} Then he brought meforth into the utter court, and caused me to pass by the four cornersof the court; and, behold, in every corner of the court [there was] acourt. 

{46:22} In the four corners of the court [there were] courtsjoined of forty [cubits] long and thirty broad: these four corners[were] of one measure. 

{46:23} And [there was] a row [of building]round about in them, round about them four, and [it was] made withboiling places under the rows round about. 

{46:24} Then said he untome, These [are] the places of them that boil, where the ministers ofthe house shall boil the sacrifice of the people.   

{47:1} Afterward he brought me again unto the door of the house;and, behold, waters issued out from under the threshold of the houseeastward: for the forefront of the house [stood toward] the east, andthe waters came down from under from the right side of the house, atthe south [side] of the altar. 

{47:2} Then brought he me out of the wayof the gate northward, and led me about the way without unto the uttergate by the way that looketh eastward; and, behold, there ran outwaters on the right side. 

{47:3} And when the man that had the line inhis hand went forth eastward, he measured a thousand cubits, and hebrought me through the waters; the waters [were] to the ancles. 

{47:4}Again he measured a thousand, and brought me through the waters; thewaters [were] to the knees. Again he measured a thousand, and broughtme through; the waters [were] to the loins. 

{47:5} Afterward hemeasured a thousand; [and it was] a river that I could not pass over:for the waters were risen, waters to swim in, a river that could not bepassed over.   

{47:6} And he said unto me, Son of man, hast thou seen [this?] Thenhe brought me, and caused me to return to the brink of the river.

{47:7} Now when I had returned, behold, at the bank of the river [were]very many trees on the one side and on the other. 

{47:8} Then said heunto me, These waters issue out toward the east country, and go downinto the desert, and go into the sea: [which being] brought forth intothe sea, the waters shall be healed. 

{47:9} And it shall come to pass,[that] every thing that liveth, which moveth, whithersoever the riversshall come, shall live: and there shall be a very great multitude offish, because these waters shall come thither: for they shall behealed; and every thing shall live whither the river cometh. 

{47:10}And it shall come to pass, [that] the fishers shall stand upon it fromEn-gedi even unto En-eglaim; they shall be a [place] to spread forthnets; their fish shall be according to their kinds, as the fish of thegreat sea, exceeding many. 

{47:11} But the miry places thereof and themarishes thereof shall not be healed; they shall be given to salt.

{47:12} And by the river upon the bank thereof, on this side and onthat side, shall grow all trees for meat, whose leaf shall not fade,neither shall the fruit thereof be consumed: it shall bring forth newfruit according to his months, because their waters they issued out ofthe sanctuary: and the fruit thereof shall be for meat, and the leafthereof for medicine.   

{47:13} Thus saith the Lord GOD; This [shall be] the border, wherebyye shall inherit the land according to the twelve tribes of Israel:Joseph [shall have two] portions. 

{47:14} And ye shall inherit it, oneas well as another: [concerning] the which I lifted up mine hand togive it unto your fathers: and this land shall fall unto you forinheritance. 

{47:15} And this [shall be] the border of the land towardthe north side, from the great sea, the way of Hethlon, as men go toZedad; 

{47:16} Hamath, Berothah, Sibraim, which [is] between the borderof Damascus and the border of Hamath; Hazar-hatticon, which is by thecoast of Hauran. 

{47:17} And the border from the sea shall beHazar-enan, the border of Damascus, and the north northward, and theborder of Hamath. And [this is] the north side. 

{47:18} And the eastside ye shall measure from Hauran, and from Damascus, and from Gilead,and from the land of Israel by Jordan, from the border unto the eastsea. And [this is] the east side. 

{47:19} And the south side southward,from Tamar [even] to the waters of strife [in] Kadesh, the river to thegreat sea. And [this is] the south side southward. 

{47:20} The westside also [shall be] the great sea from the border, till a man comeover against Hamath. This [is] the west side. 

{47:21} So shall yedivide this land unto you according to the tribes of Israel.   

{47:22} And it shall come to pass, [that] ye shall divide it by lotfor an inheritance unto you, and to the strangers that sojourn amongyou, which shall beget children among you: and they shall be unto youas born in the country among the children of Israel; they shall haveinheritance with you among the tribes of Israel. 

{47:23} And it shallcome to pass, [that] in what tribe the stranger sojourneth, there shallye give [him] his inheritance, saith the Lord GOD.   

{48:1} Now these [are] the names of the tribes. From the north endto the coast of the way of Hethlon, as one goeth to Hamath, Hazar-enan,the border of Damascus northward, to the coast of Hamath; for these arehis sides east [and] west; a [portion for] Dan.

{48:9} The oblation that ye shall offer unto theLORD [shall be] of five and twenty thousand in length, and of tenthousand in breadth. 

{48:10} And for them, [even] for the priests,shall be [this] holy oblation; toward the north five and twentythousand [in length,] and toward the west ten thousand in breadth, andtoward the east ten thousand in breadth, and toward the south five andtwenty thousand in length: and the sanctuary of the LORD shall be inthe midst thereof. 

{48:11} [It shall be] for the priests that aresanctified of the sons of Zadok; which have kept my charge, which wentnot astray when the children of Israel went astray, as the Levites wentastray. 

{48:12} And [this] oblation of the land that is offered shallbe unto them a thing most holy by the border of the Levites. 

{48:13}And over against the border of the priests the Levites [shall have]five and twenty thousand in length, and ten thousand in breadth: allthe length [shall be] five and twenty thousand, and the breadth tenthousand. 

{48:14} And they shall not sell of it, neither exchange, noralienate the firstfruits of the land: for [it is] holy unto the LORD.   

{48:15} And the five thousand, that are left in the breadth overagainst the five and twenty thousand, shall be a profane [place] forthe city, for dwelling, and for suburbs: and the city shall be in themidst thereof. 

{48:16} And these [shall be] the measures thereof; thenorth side four thousand and five hundred, and the south side fourthousand and five hundred, and on the east side four thousand and fivehundred, and the west side four thousand and five hundred. 

{48:17} Andthe suburbs of the city shall be toward the north two hundred andfifty, and toward the south two hundred and fifty, and toward the easttwo hundred and fifty, and toward the west two hundred and fifty.

{48:19} And they that serve the city shall serve it out of all thetribes of Israel. 

{48:20} All the oblation [shall be] five and twentythousand by five and twenty thousand: ye shall offer the holy oblationfoursquare, with the possession of the city.   

{48:21} And the residue [shall be] for the prince, on the one sideand on the other of the holy oblation, and of the possession of thecity, over against the five and twenty thousand of the oblation towardthe east border, and westward over against the five and twenty thousandtoward the west border, over against the portions for the prince: andit shall be the holy oblation; and the sanctuary of the house [shallbe] in the midst thereof. 

{48:22} Moreover from the possession of theLevites, and from the possession of the city, [being] in the midst [ofthat] which is the prince's, between the border of Judah and the borderof Benjamin, shall be for the prince.
