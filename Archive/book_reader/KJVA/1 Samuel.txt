{The First Book of Samuel Otherwise Called the First Book of the Kings   

{1:1} Now there was a certain man of Ramathaim-zophim, of mountEphraim, and his name was Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son ofElihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephrathite: 

{1:2} And hehad two wives; the name of the one [was] Hannah, and the name of theother Peninnah: and Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children.

{1:3} And this man went up out of his city yearly to worship and tosacrifice unto the LORD of hosts in Shiloh. And the two sons of Eli,Hophni and Phinehas, the priests of the LORD, [were] there.   

{1:4} And when the time was that Elkanah offered, he gave toPeninnah his wife, and to all her sons and her daughters, portions:

{1:5} But unto Hannah he gave a worthy portion; for he loved Hannah:but the LORD had shut up her womb. 

{1:6} And her adversary alsoprovoked her sore, for to make her fret, because the LORD had shut upher womb. 

{1:7} And [as] he did so year by year, when she went up tothe house of the LORD, so she provoked her; therefore she wept, and didnot eat. 

{1:8} Then said Elkanah her husband to her, Hannah, whyweepest thou? and why eatest thou not? and why is thy heart grieved?[am] not I better to thee than ten sons?   

{1:9} So Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh, and afterthey had drunk. Now Eli the priest sat upon a seat by a post of thetemple of the LORD. 

{1:10} And she [was] in bitterness of soul, andprayed unto the LORD, and wept sore. 

{1:11} And she vowed a vow, andsaid, O LORD of hosts, if thou wilt indeed look on the affliction ofthine handmaid, and remember me, and not forget thine handmaid, butwilt give unto thine handmaid a man child, then I will give him untothe LORD all the days of his life, and there shall no razor come uponhis head. 

{1:12} And it came to pass, as she continued praying beforethe LORD, that Eli marked her mouth. 

{1:13} Now Hannah, she spake inher heart; only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard: thereforeEli thought she had been drunken. 

{1:14} And Eli said unto her, Howlong wilt thou be drunken? put away thy wine from thee. 

{1:15} AndHannah answered and said, No, my lord, I [am] a woman of a sorrowfulspirit: I have drunken neither wine nor strong drink, but have pouredout my soul before the LORD. 

{1:16} Count not thine handmaid for adaughter of Belial: for out of the abundance of my complaint and griefhave I spoken hitherto. 

{1:17} Then Eli answered and said, Go in peace:and the God of Israel grant [thee] thy petition that thou hast asked ofhim. 

{1:18} And she said, Let thine handmaid find grace in thy sight.So the woman went her way, and did eat, and her countenance was no more[sad.]   

{1:19} And they rose up in the morning early, and worshipped beforethe LORD, and returned, and came to their house to Ramah: and Elkanahknew Hannah his wife; and the LORD remembered her. 

{1:20} Wherefore itcame to pass, when the time was come about after Hannah had conceived,that she bare a son, and called his name Samuel, [saying,] Because Ihave asked him of the LORD. 

{1:21} And the man Elkanah, and all hishouse, went up to offer unto the LORD the yearly sacrifice, and hisvow. 

{1:22} But Hannah went not up; for she said unto her husband, [Iwill not go up] until the child be weaned, and [then] I will bring him,that he may appear before the LORD, and there abide for ever. 

{1:23}And Elkanah her husband said unto her, Do what seemeth thee good; tarryuntil thou have weaned him; only the LORD establish his word. So thewoman abode, and gave her son suck until she weaned him.   

{1:24} And when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, withthree bullocks, and one ephah of flour, and a bottle of wine, andbrought him unto the house of the LORD in Shiloh: and the child [was]young. 

{1:25} And they slew a bullock, and brought the child to Eli.

{1:26} And she said, Oh my lord, [as] thy soul liveth, my lord, I [am]the woman that stood by thee here, praying unto the LORD. 

{1:27} Forthis child I prayed; and the LORD hath given me my petition which Iasked of him: 

{1:28} Therefore also I have lent him to the LORD; aslong as he liveth he shall be lent to the LORD. And he worshipped theLORD there.   

{2:1} And Hannah prayed, and said, My heart rejoiceth in the LORD,mine horn is exalted in the LORD: my mouth is enlarged over mineenemies; because I rejoice in thy salvation. 

{2:2} [There is] none holyas the LORD: for [there is] none beside thee: neither [is there] anyrock like our God. 

{2:3} Talk no more so exceeding proudly; let [not]arrogancy come out of your mouth: for the LORD is a God of knowledge,and by him actions are weighed. 

{2:4} The bows of the mighty men [are]broken, and they that stumbled are girded with strength. 

{2:5} [Theythat were] full have hired out themselves for bread; and [they thatwere] hungry ceased: so that the barren hath born seven; and she thathath many children is waxed feeble. 

{2:6} The LORD killeth, and makethalive: he bringeth down to the grave, and bringeth up. 

{2:7} The LORDmaketh poor, and maketh rich: he bringeth low, and lifteth up. 

{2:8} Heraiseth up the poor out of the dust, [and] lifteth up the beggar fromthe dunghill, to set [them] among princes, and to make them inherit thethrone of glory: for the pillars of the earth [are] the LORD'S, and hehath set the world upon them. 

{2:9} He will keep the feet of hissaints, and the wicked shall be silent in darkness; for by strengthshall no man prevail. 

{2:10} The adversaries of the LORD shall bebroken to pieces; out of heaven shall he thunder upon them: the LORDshall judge the ends of the earth; and he shall give strength unto hisking, and exalt the horn of his anointed. 

{2:11} And Elkanah went toRamah to his house. And the child did minister unto the LORD before Elithe priest.   

{2:12} Now the sons of Eli [were] sons of Belial; they knew not theLORD. 

{2:13} And the priest's custom with the people [was, that,] whenany man offered sacrifice, the priest's servant came, while the fleshwas in seething, with a fleshhook of three teeth in his hand; 

{2:14}And he struck [it] into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot; allthat the fleshhook brought up the priest took for himself. So they didin Shiloh unto all the Israelites that came thither. 

{2:15} Also beforethey burnt the fat, the priest's servant came, and said to the man thatsacrificed, Give flesh to roast for the priest; for he will not havesodden flesh of thee, but raw. 

{2:16} And [if] any man said unto him,Let them not fail to burn the fat presently, and [then] take [as much]as thy soul desireth; then he would answer him, [Nay;] but thou shaltgive [it me] now: and if not, I will take [it] by force. 

{2:17}Wherefore the sin of the young men was very great before the LORD: formen abhorred the offering of the LORD.   

{2:18} But Samuel ministered before the LORD, [being] a child,girded with a linen ephod. 

{2:19} Moreover his mother made him a littlecoat, and brought [it] to him from year to year, when she came up withher husband to offer the yearly sacrifice.   

{2:20} And Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife, and said, The LORD givethee seed of this woman for the loan which is lent to the LORD. Andthey went unto their own home. 

{2:21} And the LORD visited Hannah, sothat she conceived, and bare three sons and two daughters. And thechild Samuel grew before the LORD.   

{2:22} Now Eli was very old, and heard all that his sons did untoall Israel; and how they lay with the women that assembled [at] thedoor of the tabernacle of the congregation. 

{2:23} And he said untothem, Why do ye such things? for I hear of your evil dealings by allthis people. 

{2:24} Nay, my sons; for [it is] no good report that Ihear: ye make the LORD'S people to transgress. 

{2:25} If one man sinagainst another, the judge shall judge him: but if a man sin againstthe LORD, who shall intreat for him? Notwithstanding they hearkened notunto the voice of their father, because the LORD would slay them.

{2:26} And the child Samuel grew on, and was in favour both with theLORD, and also with men.   

{2:27} And there came a man of God unto Eli, and said unto him, Thussaith the LORD, Did I plainly appear unto the house of thy father, whenthey were in Egypt in Pharaoh's house? 

{2:28} And did I choose him outof all the tribes of Israel [to be] my priest, to offer upon minealtar, to burn incense, to wear an ephod before me? and did I give untothe house of thy father all the offerings made by fire of the childrenof Israel? 

{2:29} Wherefore kick ye at my sacrifice and at mineoffering, which I have commanded [in my] habitation; and honourest thysons above me, to make yourselves fat with the chiefest of all theofferings of Israel my people? 

{2:30} Wherefore the LORD God of Israelsaith, I said indeed [that] thy house, and the house of thy father,should walk before me for ever: but now the LORD saith, Be it far fromme; for them that honour me I will honour, and they that despise meshall be lightly esteemed. 

{2:31} Behold, the days come, that I willcut off thine arm, and the arm of thy father's house, that there shallnot be an old man in thine house. 

{2:32} And thou shalt see an enemy[in my] habitation, in all [the wealth] which [God] shall give Israel:and there shall not be an old man in thine house for ever. 

{2:33} Andthe man of thine, [whom] I shall not cut off from mine altar, [shallbe] to consume thine eyes, and to grieve thine heart: and all theincrease of thine house shall die in the flower of their age. 

{2:34}And this [shall be] a sign unto thee, that shall come upon thy twosons, on Hophni and Phinehas; in one day they shall die both of them.

{2:35} And I will raise me up a faithful priest, [that] shall doaccording to [that] which [is] in mine heart and in my mind: and I willbuild him a sure house; and he shall walk before mine anointed forever. 

{2:36} And it shall come to pass, [that] every one that is leftin thine house shall come [and] crouch to him for a piece of silver anda morsel of bread, and shall say, Put me, I pray thee, into one of thepriests' offices, that I may eat a piece of bread.   

{3:1} And the child Samuel ministered unto the LORD before Eli. Andthe word of the LORD was precious in those days; [there was] no openvision. 

{3:2} And it came to pass at that time, when Eli [was] laiddown in his place, and his eyes began to wax dim, [that] he could notsee; 

{3:3} And ere the lamp of God went out in the temple of the LORD,where the ark of God [was,] and Samuel was laid down [to sleep; ]

{3:4}That the LORD called Samuel: and he answered, Here [am] I. 

{3:5} And heran unto Eli, and said, Here [am] I; for thou calledst me. And he said,I called not; lie down again. And he went and lay down. 

{3:6} And theLORD called yet again, Samuel. And Samuel arose and went to Eli, andsaid, Here [am] I; for thou didst call me. And he answered, I callednot, my son; lie down again. 

{3:7} Now Samuel did not yet know theLORD, neither was the word of the LORD yet revealed unto him. 

{3:8} Andthe LORD called Samuel again the third time. And he arose and went toEli, and said, Here [am] I; for thou didst call me. And Eli perceivedthat the LORD had called the child. 

{3:9} Therefore Eli said untoSamuel, Go, lie down: and it shall be, if he call thee, that thou shaltsay, Speak, LORD; for thy servant heareth. So Samuel went and lay downin his place. 

{3:10} And the LORD came, and stood, and called as atother times, Samuel, Samuel. Then Samuel answered, Speak; for thyservant heareth.   

{3:11} And the LORD said to Samuel, Behold, I will do a thing inIsrael, at which both the ears of every one that heareth it shalltingle. 

{3:12} In that day I will perform against Eli all [things]which I have spoken concerning his house: when I begin, I will alsomake an end. 

{3:13} For I have told him that I will judge his house forever for the iniquity which he knoweth; because his sons madethemselves vile, and he restrained them not. 

{3:14} And therefore Ihave sworn unto the house of Eli, that the iniquity of Eli's houseshall not be purged with sacrifice nor offering for ever.   

{3:15} And Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of thehouse of the LORD. And Samuel feared to shew Eli the vision. 

{3:16}Then Eli called Samuel, and said, Samuel, my son. And he answered, Here[am] I. 

{3:17} And he said, What [is] the thing that [the LORD] hathsaid unto thee? I pray thee hide [it] not from me: God do so to thee,and more also, if thou hide [any] thing from me of all the things thathe said unto thee. 

{3:18} And Samuel told him every whit, and hidnothing from him. And he said, It [is] the LORD: let him do whatseemeth him good.   

{3:19} And Samuel grew, and the LORD was with him, and did let noneof his words fall to the ground. 

{3:20} And all Israel from Dan even toBeer-sheba knew that Samuel [was] established [to be] a prophet of theLORD. 

{3:21} And the LORD appeared again in Shiloh: for the LORDrevealed himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of the LORD.   

{4:1} And the word of Samuel came to all Israel. Now Israel went outagainst the Philistines to battle, and pitched beside Eben-ezer: andthe Philistines pitched in Aphek. 

{4:2} And the Philistines putthemselves in array against Israel: and when they joined battle, Israelwas smitten before the Philistines: and they slew of the army in thefield about four thousand men.   

{4:3} And when the people were come into the camp, the elders ofIsrael said, Wherefore hath the LORD smitten us to day before thePhilistines? Let us fetch the ark of the covenant of the LORD out ofShiloh unto us, that, when it cometh among us, it may save us out ofthe hand of our enemies. 

{4:4} So the people sent to Shiloh, that theymight bring from thence the ark of the covenant of the LORD of hosts,which dwelleth [between] the cherubims: and the two sons of Eli, Hophniand Phinehas, [were] there with the ark of the covenant of God. 

{4:5}And when the ark of the covenant of the LORD came into the camp, allIsrael shouted with a great shout, so that the earth rang again. 

{4:6}And when the Philistines heard the noise of the shout, they said, What[meaneth] the noise of this great shout in the camp of the Hebrews? Andthey understood that the ark of the LORD was come into the camp. 

{4:7}And the Philistines were afraid, for they said, God is come into thecamp. And they said, Woe unto us! for there hath not been such a thingheretofore. 

{4:8} Woe unto us! who shall deliver us out of the hand ofthese mighty Gods? these [are] the Gods that smote the Egyptians withall the plagues in the wilderness. 

{4:9} Be strong, and quit yourselveslike men, O ye Philistines, that ye be not servants unto the Hebrews,as they have been to you: quit yourselves like men, and fight.   

{4:10} And the Philistines fought, and Israel was smitten, and theyfled every man into his tent: and there was a very great slaughter; forthere fell of Israel thirty thousand footmen. 

{4:11} And the ark of Godwas taken; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were slain.   

{4:12} And there ran a man of Benjamin out of the army, and came toShiloh the same day with his clothes rent, and with earth upon hishead. 

{4:13} And when he came, lo, Eli sat upon a seat by the waysidewatching: for his heart trembled for the ark of God. And when the mancame into the city, and told [it,] all the city cried out. 

{4:14} Andwhen Eli heard the noise of the crying, he said, What [meaneth] thenoise of this tumult? And the man came in hastily, and told Eli. 

{4:15}Now Eli was ninety and eight years old; and his eyes were dim, that hecould not see. 

{4:16} And the man said unto Eli, I [am] he that cameout of the army, and I fled to day out of the army. And he said, Whatis there done, my son? 

{4:17} And the messenger answered and said,Israel is fled before the Philistines, and there hath been also a greatslaughter among the people, and thy two sons also, Hophni and Phinehas,are dead, and the ark of God is taken. 

{4:18} And it came to pass, whenhe made mention of the ark of God, that he fell from off the seatbackward by the side of the gate, and his neck brake, and he died: forhe was an old man, and heavy. And he had judged Israel forty years.   

{4:19} And his daughter in law, Phinehas' wife, was with child,[near] to be delivered: and when she heard the tidings that the ark ofGod was taken, and that her father in law and her husband were dead,she bowed herself and travailed; for her pains came upon her. 

{4:20}And about the time of her death the women that stood by her said untoher, Fear not; for thou hast born a son. But she answered not, neitherdid she regard [it. ]

{4:21} And she named the child I-chabod, saying,The glory is departed from Israel: because the ark of God was taken,and because of her father in law and her husband. 

{4:22} And she said,The glory is departed from Israel: for the ark of God is taken.   

{5:1} And the Philistines took the ark of God, and brought it fromEben-ezer unto Ashdod. 

{5:2} When the Philistines took the ark of God,they brought it into the house of Dagon, and set it by Dagon.   

{5:3} And when they of Ashdod arose early on the morrow, behold,Dagon [was] fallen upon his face to the earth before the ark of theLORD. And they took Dagon, and set him in his place again. 

{5:4} Andwhen they arose early on the morrow morning, behold, Dagon [was] fallenupon his face to the ground before the ark of the LORD; and the head ofDagon and both the palms of his hands [were] cut off upon thethreshold; only [the stump of] Dagon was left to him. 

{5:5} Thereforeneither the priests of Dagon, nor any that come into Dagon's house,tread on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod unto this day. 

{5:6} But thehand of the LORD was heavy upon them of Ashdod, and he destroyed them,and smote them with emerods, [even] Ashdod and the coasts thereof.

{5:7} And when the men of Ashdod saw that [it was] so, they said, Theark of the God of Israel shall not abide with us: for his hand is soreupon us, and upon Dagon our god. 

{5:8} They sent therefore and gatheredall the lords of the Philistines unto them, and said, What shall we dowith the ark of the God of Israel? And they answered, Let the ark ofthe God of Israel be carried about unto Gath. And they carried the arkof the God of Israel about [thither. ]

{5:9} And it was [so,] that,after they had carried it about, the hand of the LORD was against thecity with a very great destruction: and he smote the men of the city,both small and great, and they had emerods in their secret parts.   

{5:10} Therefore they sent the ark of God to Ekron. And it came topass, as the ark of God came to Ekron, that the Ekronites cried out,saying, They have brought about the ark of the God of Israel to us, toslay us and our people. 

{5:11} So they sent and gathered together allthe lords of the Philistines, and said, Send away the ark of the God ofIsrael, and let it go again to his own place, that it slay us not, andour people: for there was a deadly destruction throughout all the city;the hand of God was very heavy there. 

{5:12} And the men that died notwere smitten with the emerods: and the cry of the city went up toheaven.   

{6:1} And the ark of the LORD was in the country of the Philistinesseven months. 

{6:2} And the Philistines called for the priests and thediviners, saying, What shall we do to the ark of the LORD? tell uswherewith we shall send it to his place. 

{6:3} And they said, If yesend away the ark of the God of Israel, send it not empty; but in anywise return him a trespass offering: then ye shall be healed, and itshall be known to you why his hand is not removed from you. 

{6:4} Thensaid they, What [shall be] the trespass offering which we shall returnto him? They answered, Five golden emerods, and five golden mice,[according to] the number of the lords of the Philistines: for oneplague was on you all, and on your lords. 

{6:5} Wherefore ye shall makeimages of your emerods, and images of your mice that mar the land; andye shall give glory unto the God of Israel: peradventure he willlighten his hand from off you, and from off your gods, and from offyour land. 

{6:6} Wherefore then do ye harden your hearts, as theEgyptians and Pharaoh hardened their hearts? when he had wroughtwonderfully among them, did they not let the people go, and theydeparted? 

{6:7} Now therefore make a new cart, and take two milch kine,on which there hath come no yoke, and tie the kine to the cart, andbring their calves home from them: 

{6:8} And take the ark of the LORD,and lay it upon the cart; and put the jewels of gold, which ye returnhim [for] a trespass offering, in a coffer by the side thereof; andsend it away, that it may go. 

{6:9} And see, if it goeth up by the wayof his own coast to Beth-shemesh, [then] he hath done us this greatevil: but if not, then we shall know that [it is] not his hand [that]smote us; it [was] a chance [that] happened to us.   

{6:10} And the men did so; and took two milch kine, and tied them tothe cart, and shut up their calves at home: 

{6:11} And they laid theark of the LORD upon the cart, and the coffer with the mice of gold andthe images of their emerods. 

{6:12} And the kine took the straight wayto the way of Beth-shemesh, [and] went along the highway, lowing asthey went, and turned not aside [to] the right hand or [to] the left;and the lords of the Philistines went after them unto the border ofBeth-shemesh. 

{6:13} And [they of] Beth-shemesh [were] reaping theirwheat harvest in the valley: and they lifted up their eyes, and saw theark, and rejoiced to see [it. ]

{6:14} And the cart came into the fieldof Joshua, a Beth-shemite, and stood there, where [there was] a greatstone: and they clave the wood of the cart, and offered the kine aburnt offering unto the LORD. 

{6:15} And the Levites took down the arkof the LORD, and the coffer that [was] with it, wherein the jewels ofgold [were,] and put [them] on the great stone: and the men of Beth-shemesh offered burnt offerings and sacrificed sacrifices the same dayunto the LORD. 

{6:16} And when the five lords of the Philistines hadseen [it,] they returned to Ekron the same day. 

{6:17} And these [are]the golden emerods which the Philistines returned [for] a trespassoffering unto the LORD; for Ashdod one, for Gaza one, for Askelon one,for Gath one, for Ekron one; 

{6:18} And the golden mice, [according to]the number of all the cities of the Philistines [belonging] to the fivelords, [both] of fenced cities, and of country villages, even unto thegreat [stone] of Abel, whereon they set down the ark of the LORD:[which stone remaineth] unto this day in the field of Joshua, theBeth-shemite.   

{6:19} And he smote the men of Beth-shemesh, because they had lookedinto the ark of the LORD, even he smote of the people fifty thousandand threescore and ten men: and the people lamented, because the LORDhad smitten [many] of the people with a great slaughter. 

{6:20} And themen of Beth-shemesh said, Who is able to stand before this holy LORDGod? and to whom shall he go up from us?   

{6:21} And they sent messengers to the inhabitants ofKirjath-jearim, saying, The Philistines have brought again the ark ofthe LORD; come ye down, [and] fetch it up to you.   

{7:1} And the men of Kirjath-jearim came, and brought up the ark ofthe LORD, and brought it into the house of Abinadab in the hill, andsanctified Eleazar his son to keep the ark of the LORD. 

{7:2} And itcame to pass, while the ark abode in Kirjath-jearim, that the time waslong; for it was twenty years: and all the house of Israel lamentedafter the LORD.   

{7:3} And Samuel spake unto all the house of Israel, saying, If yedo return unto the LORD with all your hearts, [then] put away thestrange gods and Ashtaroth from among you, and prepare your hearts untothe LORD, and serve him only: and he will deliver you out of the handof the Philistines. 

{7:4} Then the children of Israel did put awayBaalim and Ashtaroth, and served the LORD only. 

{7:5} And Samuel said,Gather all Israel to Mizpeh, and I will pray for you unto the LORD.

{7:6} And they gathered together to Mizpeh, and drew water, and poured[it] out before the LORD, and fasted on that day, and said there, Wehave sinned against the LORD. And Samuel judged the children of Israelin Mizpeh. 

{7:7} And when the Philistines heard that the children ofIsrael were gathered together to Mizpeh, the lords of the Philistineswent up against Israel. And when the children of Israel heard [it,]they were afraid of the Philistines. 

{7:8} And the children of Israelsaid to Samuel, Cease not to cry unto the LORD our God for us, that hewill save us out of the hand of the Philistines.   

{7:9} And Samuel took a sucking lamb, and offered [it for] a burntoffering wholly unto the LORD: and Samuel cried unto the LORD forIsrael; and the LORD heard him. 

{7:10} And as Samuel was offering upthe burnt offering, the Philistines drew near to battle against Israel:but the LORD thundered with a great thunder on that day upon thePhilistines, and discomfited them; and they were smitten before Israel.

{7:11} And the men of Israel went out of Mizpeh, and pursued thePhilistines, and smote them, until [they came] under Beth-car. 

{7:12}Then Samuel took a stone, and set [it] between Mizpeh and Shen, andcalled the name of it Eben-ezer, saying, Hitherto hath the LORD helpedus.   

{7:13} So the Philistines were subdued, and they came no more intothe coast of Israel: and the hand of the LORD was against thePhilistines all the days of Samuel. 

{7:14} And the cities which thePhilistines had taken from Israel were restored to Israel, from Ekroneven unto Gath; and the coasts thereof did Israel deliver out of thehands of the Philistines. And there was peace between Israel and theAmorites. 

{7:15} And Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life.

{7:16} And he went from year to year in circuit to Bethel, and Gilgal,and Mizpeh, and judged Israel in all those places. 

{7:17} And hisreturn [was] to Ramah; for there [was] his house; and there he judgedIsrael; and there he built an altar unto the LORD.   

{8:1} And it came to pass, when Samuel was old, that he made hissons judges over Israel. 

{8:2} Now the name of his firstborn was Joel;and the name of his second, Abiah: [they were] judges in Beer-sheba.

{8:3} And his sons walked not in his ways, but turned aside afterlucre, and took bribes, and perverted judgment. 

{8:4} Then all theelders of Israel gathered themselves together, and came to Samuel untoRamah, 

{8:5} And said unto him, Behold, thou art old, and thy sons walknot in thy ways: now make us a king to judge us like all the nations.   

{8:6} But the thing displeased Samuel, when they said, Give us aking to judge us. And Samuel prayed unto the LORD. 

{8:7} And the LORDsaid unto Samuel, Hearken unto the voice of the people in all that theysay unto thee: for they have not rejected thee, but they have rejectedme, that I should not reign over them. 

{8:8} According to all the workswhich they have done since the day that I brought them up out of Egypteven unto this day, wherewith they have forsaken me, and served othergods, so do they also unto thee. 

{8:9} Now therefore hearken unto theirvoice: howbeit yet protest solemnly unto them, and shew them the mannerof the king that shall reign over them.   

{8:10} And Samuel told all the words of the LORD unto the peoplethat asked of him a king. 

{8:11} And he said, This will be the mannerof the king that shall reign over you: He will take your sons, andappoint [them] for himself, for his chariots, and to be his horsemen;and [some] shall run before his chariots. 

{8:12} And he will appointhim captains over thousands, and captains over fifties; and [will setthem] to ear his ground, and to reap his harvest, and to make hisinstruments of war, and instruments of his chariots. 

{8:13} And he willtake your daughters [to be] confectionaries, and [to be] cooks, and [tobe] bakers. 

{8:14} And he will take your fields, and your vineyards,and your oliveyards, [even] the best [of them,] and give [them] to hisservants. 

{8:15} And he will take the tenth of your seed, and of yourvineyards, and give to his officers, and to his servants. 

{8:16} And hewill take your menservants, and your maidservants, and your goodliestyoung men, and your asses, and put [them] to his work. 

{8:17} He willtake the tenth of your sheep: and ye shall be his servants. 

{8:18} Andye shall cry out in that day because of your king which ye shall havechosen you; and the LORD will not hear you in that day.   

{8:19} Nevertheless the people refused to obey the voice of Samuel;and they said, Nay; but we will have a king over us; 

{8:20} That wealso may be like all the nations; and that our king may judge us, andgo out before us, and fight our battles. 

{8:21} And Samuel heard allthe words of the people, and he rehearsed them in the ears of the LORD.

{8:22} And the LORD said to Samuel, Hearken unto their voice, and makethem a king. And Samuel said unto the men of Israel, Go ye every manunto his city.   

{9:1} Now there was a man of Benjamin, whose name [was] Kish, theson of Abiel, the son of Zeror, the son of Bechorath, the son ofAphiah, a Benjamite, a mighty man of power. 

{9:2} And he had a son,whose name [was] Saul, a choice young man, and a goodly: and [therewas] not among the children of Israel a goodlier person than he: fromhis shoulders and upward [he was] higher than any of the people. 

{9:3}And the asses of Kish Saul's father were lost. And Kish said to Saulhis son, Take now one of the servants with thee, and arise, go seek theasses. 

{9:4} And he passed through mount Ephraim, and passed throughthe land of Shalisha, but they found [them] not: then they passedthrough the land of Shalim, and [there they were] not: and he passedthrough the land of the Benjamites, but they found [them] not. 

{9:5}[And] when they were come to the land of Zuph, Saul said to his servantthat [was] with him, Come, and let us return; lest my father leave[caring] for the asses, and take thought for us. 

{9:6} And he said untohim, Behold now, [there is] in this city a man of God, and [he is] anhonourable man; all that he saith cometh surely to pass: now let us gothither; peradventure he can shew us our way that we should go. 

{9:7}Then said Saul to his servant, But, behold, [if] we go, what shall webring the man? for the bread is spent in our vessels, and [there is]not a present to bring to the man of God: what have we? 

{9:8} And theservant answered Saul again, and said, Behold, I have here at hand thefourth part of a shekel of silver: [that] will I give to the man ofGod, to tell us our way. 

{9:9} (Beforetime in Israel, when a man wentto enquire of God, thus he spake, Come, and let us go to the seer: for[he that is] now [called] a Prophet was beforetime called a Seer.)

{9:10} Then said Saul to his servant, Well said; come, let us go. Sothey went unto the city where the man of God [was.]   

{9:11} [And] as they went up the hill to the city, they found youngmaidens going out to draw water, and said unto them, Is the seer here?

{9:12} And they answered them, and said, He is; behold, [he is] beforeyou: make haste now, for he came to day to the city; for [there is] asacrifice of the people to day in the high place: 

{9:13} As soon as yebe come into the city, ye shall straightway find him, before he go upto the high place to eat: for the people will not eat until he come,because he doth bless the sacrifice; [and] afterwards they eat that bebidden. Now therefore get you up; for about this time ye shall findhim. 

{9:14} And they went up into the city: [and] when they were comeinto the city, behold, Samuel came out against them, for to go up tothe high place.   

{9:15} Now the LORD had told Samuel in his ear a day before Saulcame, saying, 

{9:16} To morrow about this time I will send thee a manout of the land of Benjamin, and thou shalt anoint him [to be] captainover my people Israel, that he may save my people out of the hand ofthe Philistines: for I have looked upon my people, because their cry iscome unto me. 

{9:17} And when Samuel saw Saul, the LORD said unto him,Behold the man whom I spake to thee of! this same shall reign over mypeople. 

{9:18} Then Saul drew near to Samuel in the gate, and said,Tell me, I pray thee, where the seer's house [is. ]

{9:19} And Samuelanswered Saul, and said, I [am] the seer: go up before me unto the highplace; for ye shall eat with me to day, and to morrow I will let theego, and will tell thee all that [is] in thine heart. 

{9:20} And as forthine asses that were lost three days ago, set not thy mind on them;for they are found. And on whom [is] all the desire of Israel? [Is it]not on thee, and on all thy father's house? 

{9:21} And Saul answeredand said, [Am] not I a Benjamite, of the smallest of the tribes ofIsrael? and my family the least of all the families of the tribe ofBenjamin? wherefore then speakest thou so to me? 

{9:22} And Samuel tookSaul and his servant, and brought them into the parlour, and made themsit in the chiefest place among them that were bidden, which [were]about thirty persons. 

{9:23} And Samuel said unto the cook, Bring theportion which I gave thee, of which I said unto thee, Set it by thee.

{9:24} And the cook took up the shoulder, and [that] which [was] uponit, and set [it] before Saul. And [Samuel] said, Behold that which isleft! set [it] before thee, [and] eat: for unto this time hath it beenkept for thee since I said, I have invited the people. So Saul did eatwith Samuel that day.   

{9:25} And when they were come down from the high place into thecity, [Samuel] communed with Saul upon the top of the house. 

{9:26} Andthey arose early: and it came to pass about the spring of the day, thatSamuel called Saul to the top of the house, saying, Up, that I may sendthee away. And Saul arose, and they went out both of them, he andSamuel, abroad. 

{9:27} [And] as they were going down to the end of thecity, Samuel said to Saul, Bid the servant pass on before us, (and hepassed on,) but stand thou still a while, that I may shew thee the wordof God.   

{10:1} Then Samuel took a vial of oil, and poured [it] upon hishead, and kissed him, and said, [Is it] not because the LORD hathanointed thee [to be] captain over his inheritance? 

{10:2} When thouart departed from me to day, then thou shalt find two men by Rachel'ssepulchre in the border of Benjamin at Zelzah; and they will say untothee, The asses which thou wentest to seek are found: and, lo, thyfather hath left the care of the asses, and sorroweth for you, saying,What shall I do for my son? 

{10:3} Then shalt thou go on forward fromthence, and thou shalt come to the plain of Tabor, and there shall meetthee three men going up to God to Bethel, one carrying three kids, andanother carrying three loaves of bread, and another carrying a bottleof wine: 

{10:4} And they will salute thee, and give thee two [loaves]of bread; which thou shalt receive of their hands. 

{10:5} After thatthou shalt come to the hill of God, where [is] the garrison of thePhilistines: and it shall come to pass, when thou art come thither tothe city, that thou shalt meet a company of prophets coming down fromthe high place with a psaltery, and a tabret, and a pipe, and a harp,before them; and they shall prophesy: 

{10:6} And the Spirit of the LORDwill come upon thee, and thou shalt prophesy with them, and shalt beturned into another man. 

{10:7} And let it be, when these signs arecome unto thee, [that] thou do as occasion serve thee; for God [is]with thee. 

{10:8} And thou shalt go down before me to Gilgal; and,behold, I will come down unto thee, to offer burnt offerings, [and] tosacrifice sacrifices of peace offerings: seven days shalt thou tarry,till I come to thee, and shew thee what thou shalt do.   

{10:9} And it was [so,] that when he had turned his back to go fromSamuel, God gave him another heart: and all those signs came to passthat day. 

{10:10} And when they came thither to the hill, behold, acompany of prophets met him; and the Spirit of God came upon him, andhe prophesied among them. 

{10:11} And it came to pass, when all thatknew him beforetime saw that, behold, he prophesied among the prophets,then the people said one to another, What [is] this [that] is come untothe son of Kish? [Is] Saul also among the prophets? 

{10:12} And one ofthe same place answered and said, But who [is] their father? Thereforeit became a proverb, [Is] Saul also among the prophets? 

{10:13} Andwhen he had made an end of prophesying, he came to the high place.   

{10:14} And Saul's uncle said unto him and to his servant, Whitherwent ye? And he said, To seek the asses: and when we saw that [theywere] no where, we came to Samuel. 

{10:15} And Saul's uncle said, Tellme, I pray thee, what Samuel said unto you. 

{10:16} And Saul said untohis uncle, He told us plainly that the asses were found. But of thematter of the kingdom, whereof Samuel spake, he told him not.   

{10:17} And Samuel called the people together unto the LORD toMizpeh; 

{10:18} And said unto the children of Israel, Thus saith theLORD God of Israel, I brought up Israel out of Egypt, and delivered youout of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all kingdoms,[and] of them that oppressed you: 

{10:19} And ye have this day rejectedyour God, who himself saved you out of all your adversities and yourtribulations; and ye have said unto him, [Nay,] but set a king over us.Now therefore present yourselves before the LORD by your tribes, and byyour thousands. 

{10:20} And when Samuel had caused all the tribes ofIsrael to come near, the tribe of Benjamin was taken. 

{10:21} When hehad caused the tribe of Benjamin to come near by their families, thefamily of Matri was taken, and Saul the son of Kish was taken: and whenthey sought him, he could not be found. 

{10:22} Therefore they enquiredof the LORD further, if the man should yet come thither. And the LORDanswered, Behold, he hath hid himself among the stuff. 

{10:23} And theyran and fetched him thence: and when he stood among the people, he washigher than any of the people from his shoulders and upward. 

{10:24}And Samuel said to all the people, See ye him whom the LORD hathchosen, that [there is] none like him among all the people? And all thepeople shouted, and said, God save the king. 

{10:25} Then Samuel toldthe people the manner of the kingdom, and wrote [it] in a book, andlaid [it ]up before the LORD. And Samuel sent all the people away,every man to his house.   

{10:26} And Saul also went home to Gibeah; and there went with him aband of men, whose hearts God had touched. 

{10:27} But the children ofBelial said, How shall this man save us? And they despised him, andbrought him no presents. But he held his peace. 

{11:1} Then Nahash theAmmonite came up, and encamped against Jabesh-gilead: and all the menof Jabesh said unto Nahash, Make a covenant with us, and we will servethee. 

{11:2} And Nahash the Ammonite answered them, On this [condition]will I make [a covenant] with you, that I may thrust out all your righteyes, and lay it [for] a reproach upon all Israel. 

{11:3} And theelders of Jabesh said unto him, Give us seven days respite, that we maysend messengers unto all the coasts of Israel: and then, if [there be]no man to save us, we will come out to thee.   

{11:4} Then came the messengers to Gibeah of Saul, and told thetidings in the ears of the people: and all the people lifted up theirvoices, and wept. 

{11:5} And, behold, Saul came after the herd out ofthe field; and Saul said, What [aileth] the people that they weep? Andthey told him the tidings of the men of Jabesh. 

{11:6} And the Spiritof God came upon Saul when he heard those tidings, and his anger waskindled greatly. 

{11:7} And he took a yoke of oxen, and hewed them inpieces, and sent [them] throughout all the coasts of Israel by thehands of messengers, saying, Whosoever cometh not forth after Saul andafter Samuel, so shall it be done unto his oxen. And the fear of theLORD fell on the people, and they came out with one consent. 

{11:8} Andwhen he numbered them in Bezek, the children of Israel were threehundred thousand, and the men of Judah thirty thousand. 

{11:9} And theysaid unto the messengers that came, Thus shall ye say unto the men ofJabesh-gilead, To morrow, by [that time] the sun be hot, ye shall havehelp. And the messengers came and shewed [it] to the men of Jabesh; andthey were glad. 

{11:10} Therefore the men of Jabesh said, To morrow wewill come out unto you, and ye shall do with us all that seemeth goodunto you. 

{11:11} And it was [so] on the morrow, that Saul put thepeople in three companies; and they came into the midst of the host inthe morning watch, and slew the Ammonites until the heat of the day:and it came to pass, that they which remained were scattered, so thattwo of them were not left together.   

{11:12} And the people said unto Samuel, Who [is] he that said,Shall Saul reign over us? bring the men, that we may put them to death.

{11:13} And Saul said, There shall not a man be put to death this day:for to day the LORD hath wrought salvation in Israel. 

{11:14} Then saidSamuel to the people, Come, and let us go to Gilgal, and renew thekingdom there. 

{11:15} And all the people went to Gilgal; and therethey made Saul king before the LORD in Gilgal; and there theysacrificed sacrifices of peace offerings before the LORD; and thereSaul and all the men of Israel rejoiced greatly.   

{12:1} And Samuel said unto all Israel, Behold, I have hearkenedunto your voice in all that ye said unto me, and have made a king overyou. 

{12:2} And now, behold, the king walketh before you: and I am oldand grayheaded; and, behold, my sons [are] with you: and I have walkedbefore you from my childhood unto this day. 

{12:3} Behold, here I [am:]witness against me before the LORD, and before his anointed: whose oxhave I taken? or whose ass have I taken? or whom have I defrauded? whomhave I oppressed? or of whose hand have I received [any] bribe to blindmine eyes therewith? and I will restore it you. 

{12:4} And they said,Thou hast not defrauded us, nor oppressed us, neither hast thou takenought of any man's hand. 

{12:5} And he said unto them, The LORD [is]witness against you, and his anointed [is] witness this day, that yehave not found ought in my hand. And they answered, [He is] witness.   

{12:6} And Samuel said unto the people, [It is] the LORD thatadvanced Moses and Aaron, and that brought your fathers up out of theland of Egypt. 

{12:7} Now therefore stand still, that I may reason withyou before the LORD of all the righteous acts of the LORD, which he didto you and to your fathers. 

{12:8} When Jacob was come into Egypt, andyour fathers cried unto the LORD, then the LORD sent Moses and Aaron,which brought forth your fathers out of Egypt, and made them dwell inthis place. 

{12:9} And when they forgat the LORD their God, he soldthem into the hand of Sisera, captain of the host of Hazor, and intothe hand of the Philistines, and into the hand of the king of Moab, andthey fought against them. 

{12:10} And they cried unto the LORD, andsaid, We have sinned, because we have forsaken the LORD, and haveserved Baalim and Ashtaroth: but now deliver us out of the hand of ourenemies, and we will serve thee. 

{12:11} And the LORD sent Jerubbaal,and Bedan, and Jephthah, and Samuel, and delivered you out of the handof your enemies on every side, and ye dwelled safe. 

{12:12} And when yesaw that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon came against you, yesaid unto me, Nay; but a king shall reign over us: when the LORD yourGod [was] your king. 

{12:13} Now therefore behold the king whom ye havechosen, [and] whom ye have desired! and, behold, the LORD hath set aking over you. 

{12:14} If ye will fear the LORD, and serve him, andobey his voice, and not rebel against the commandment of the LORD, thenshall both ye and also the king that reigneth over you continuefollowing the LORD your God: 

{12:15} But if ye will not obey the voiceof the LORD, but rebel against the commandment of the LORD, then shallthe hand of the LORD be against you, as [it was] against your fathers.   

{12:16} Now therefore stand and see this great thing, which the LORDwill do before your eyes. 

{12:17} [Is it] not wheat harvest to day? Iwill call unto the LORD, and he shall send thunder and rain; that yemay perceive and see that your wickedness [is] great, which ye havedone in the sight of the LORD, in asking you a king. 

{12:18} So Samuelcalled unto the LORD; and the LORD sent thunder and rain that day: andall the people greatly feared the LORD and Samuel. 

{12:19} And all thepeople said unto Samuel, Pray for thy servants unto the LORD thy God,that we die not: for we have added unto all our sins [this] evil, toask us a king.   

{12:20} And Samuel said unto the people, Fear not: ye have done allthis wickedness: yet turn not aside from following the LORD, but servethe LORD with all your heart; 

{12:21} And turn ye not aside: for [thenshould ye go] after vain [things,] which cannot profit nor deliver; forthey [are] vain. 

{12:22} For the LORD will not forsake his people forhis great name's sake: because it hath pleased the LORD to make you hispeople. 

{12:23} Moreover as for me, God forbid that I should sinagainst the LORD in ceasing to pray for you: but I will teach you thegood and the right way: 

{12:24} Only fear the LORD, and serve him intruth with all your heart: for consider how great [things] he hath donefor you. 

{12:25} But if ye shall still do wickedly, ye shall beconsumed, both ye and your king.   

{13:1} Saul reigned one year; and when he had reigned two years overIsrael, 

{13:2} Saul chose him three thousand [men] of Israel; [whereof]two thousand were with Saul in Michmash and in mount Bethel, and athousand were with Jonathan in Gibeah of Benjamin: and the rest of thepeople he sent every man to his tent. 

{13:3} And Jonathan smote thegarrison of the Philistines that [was] in Geba, and the Philistinesheard [of it.] And Saul blew the trumpet throughout all the land,saying, Let the Hebrews hear. 

{13:4} And all Israel heard say [that]Saul had smitten a garrison of the Philistines, and [that] Israel alsowas had in abomination with the Philistines. And the people were calledtogether after Saul to Gilgal.   

{13:5} And the Philistines gathered themselves together to fightwith Israel, thirty thousand chariots, and six thousand horsemen, andpeople as the sand which [is] on the sea shore in multitude: and theycame up, and pitched in Michmash, eastward from Beth- aven. 

{13:6} Whenthe men of Israel saw that they were in a strait, (for the people weredistressed,) then the people did hide themselves in caves, and inthickets, and in rocks, and in high places, and in pits. 

{13:7} And[some of] the Hebrews went over Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead.As for Saul, he [was] yet in Gilgal, and all the people followed himtrembling.   

{13:8} And he tarried seven days, according to the set time thatSamuel [had appointed:] but Samuel came not to Gilgal; and the peoplewere scattered from him. 

{13:9} And Saul said, Bring hither a burntoffering to me, and peace offerings. And he offered the burnt offering.

{13:10} And it came to pass, that as soon as he had made an end ofoffering the burnt offering, behold, Samuel came; and Saul went out tomeet him, that he might salute him.   

{13:11} And Samuel said, What hast thou done? And Saul said, BecauseI saw that the people were scattered from me, and [that] thou camestnot within the days appointed, and [that] the Philistines gatheredthemselves together at Michmash; 

{13:12} Therefore said I, ThePhilistines will come down now upon me to Gilgal, and I have not madesupplication unto the LORD: I forced myself therefore, and offered aburnt offering. 

{13:13} And Samuel said to Saul, Thou hast donefoolishly: thou hast not kept the commandment of the LORD thy God,which he commanded thee: for now would the LORD have established thykingdom upon Israel for ever. 

{13:14} But now thy kingdom shall notcontinue: the LORD hath sought him a man after his own heart, and theLORD hath commanded him [to be] captain over his people, because thouhast not kept [that] which the LORD commanded thee. 

{13:15} And Samuelarose, and gat him up from Gilgal unto Gibeah of Benjamin. And Saulnumbered the people [that were] present with him, about six hundredmen. 

{13:16} And Saul, and Jonathan his son, and the people [that were]present with them, abode in Gibeah of Benjamin: but the Philistinesencamped in Michmash.   

{13:17} And the spoilers came out of the camp of the Philistines inthree companies: one company turned unto the way [that leadeth to]Ophrah, unto the land of Shual: 

{13:18} And another company turned theway [to] Beth-horon: and another company turned [to] the way of theborder that looketh to the valley of Zeboim toward the wilderness.   

{13:19} Now there was no smith found throughout all the land ofIsrael: for the Philistines said, Lest the Hebrews make [them] swordsor spears: 

{13:20} But all the Israelites went down to the Philistines,to sharpen every man his share, and his coulter, and his axe, and hismattock. 

{13:21} Yet they had a file for the mattocks, and for thecoulters, and for the forks, and for the axes, and to sharpen thegoads. 

{13:22} So it came to pass in the day of battle, that there wasneither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people that[were] with Saul and Jonathan: but with Saul and with Jonathan his sonwas there found. 

{13:23} And the garrison of the Philistines went outto the passage of Michmash.   

{14:1} Now it came to pass upon a day, that Jonathan the son of Saulsaid unto the young man that bare his armour, Come, and let us go overto the Philistines' garrison, that [is] on the other side. But he toldnot his father. 

{14:2} And Saul tarried in the uttermost part of Gibeahunder a pomegranate tree which is in Migron: and the people that [were]with him [were] about six hundred men; 

{14:3} And Ahiah, the son ofAhitub, I-chabod's brother, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eli, theLORD'S priest in Shiloh, wearing an ephod. And the people knew not thatJonathan was gone.   

{14:4} And between the passages, by which Jonathan sought to go overunto the Philistines' garrison, [there was] a sharp rock on the oneside and a sharp rock on the other side: and the name of the one [was]Bozez, and the name of the other Seneh. 

{14:5} The forefront of the one[was] situate northward over against Michmash, and the other southwardover against Gibeah. 

{14:6} And Jonathan said to the young man thatbare his armour, Come, and let us go over unto the garrison of theseuncircumcised: it may be that the LORD will work for us: for [there is]no restraint to the LORD to save by many or by few. 

{14:7} And hisarmourbearer said unto him, Do all that [is] in thine heart: turn thee;behold, I [am] with thee according to thy heart. 

{14:8} Then saidJonathan, Behold, we will pass over unto [these] men, and we willdiscover ourselves unto them. 

{14:9} If they say thus unto us, Tarryuntil we come to you; then we will stand still in our place, and willnot go up unto them. 

{14:10} But if they say thus, Come up unto us;then we will go up: for the LORD hath delivered them into our hand: andthis [shall be] a sign unto us. 

{14:11} And both of them discoveredthemselves unto the garrison of the Philistines: and the Philistinessaid, Behold, the Hebrews come forth out of the holes where they hadhid themselves. 

{14:12} And the men of the garrison answered Jonathanand his armourbearer, and said, Come up to us, and we will shew you athing. And Jonathan said unto his armourbearer, Come up after me: forthe LORD hath delivered them into the hand of Israel. 

{14:13} AndJonathan climbed up upon his hands and upon his feet, and hisarmourbearer after him: and they fell before Jonathan; and hisarmourbearer slew after him. 

{14:14} And that first slaughter, whichJonathan and his armourbearer made, was about twenty men, within as itwere an half acre of land, [which] a yoke [of oxen might plow. ]

{14:15}And there was trembling in the host, in the field, and among all thepeople: the garrison, and the spoilers, they also trembled, and theearth quaked: so it was a very great trembling. 

{14:16} And thewatchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin looked; and, behold, themultitude melted away, and they went on beating down [one another.]

{14:17} Then said Saul unto the people that [were] with him, Numbernow, and see who is gone from us. And when they had numbered, behold,Jonathan and his armourbearer [were] not [there. ]

{14:18} And Saul saidunto Ahiah, Bring hither the ark of God. For the ark of God was at thattime with the children of Israel.   

{14:19} And it came to pass, while Saul talked unto the priest, thatthe noise that [was] in the host of the Philistines went on andincreased: and Saul said unto the priest, Withdraw thine hand. 

{14:20}And Saul and all the people that [were] with him assembled themselves,and they came to the battle: and, behold, every man's sword was againsthis fellow, [and there was] a very great discomfiture. 

{14:21} Moreoverthe Hebrews [that] were with the Philistines before that time, whichwent up with them into the camp [from the country] round about, eventhey also [turned] to be with the Israelites that [were] with Saul andJonathan. 

{14:22} Likewise all the men of Israel which had hidthemselves in mount Ephraim, [when] they heard that the Philistinesfled, even they also followed hard after them in the battle. 

{14:23} Sothe LORD saved Israel that day: and the battle passed over untoBeth-aven.   

{14:24} And the men of Israel were distressed that day: for Saul hadadjured the people, saying, Cursed [be] the man that eateth [any] fooduntil evening, that I may be avenged on mine enemies. So none of thepeople tasted [any] food. 

{14:25} And all [they of] the land came to awood; and there was honey upon the ground. 

{14:26} And when the peoplewere come into the wood, behold, the honey dropped; but no man put hishand to his mouth: for the people feared the oath. 

{14:27} But Jonathanheard not when his father charged the people with the oath: whereforehe put forth the end of the rod that [was] in his hand, and dipped itin an honeycomb, and put his hand to his mouth; and his eyes wereenlightened. 

{14:28} Then answered one of the people, and said, Thyfather straitly charged the people with an oath, saying, Cursed [be]the man that eateth [any] food this day. And the people were faint.

{14:29} Then said Jonathan, My father hath troubled the land: see, Ipray you, how mine eyes have been enlightened, because I tasted alittle of this honey. 

{14:30} How much more, if haply the people hadeaten freely to day of the spoil of their enemies which they found? forhad there not been now a much greater slaughter among the Philistines?

{14:31} And they smote the Philistines that day from Michmash toAijalon: and the people were very faint. 

{14:32} And the people flewupon the spoil, and took sheep, and oxen, and calves, and slew [them]on the ground: and the people did eat [them] with the blood.   

{14:33} Then they told Saul, saying, Behold, the people sin againstthe LORD, in that they eat with the blood. And he said, Ye havetransgressed: roll a great stone unto me this day. 

{14:34} And Saulsaid, Disperse yourselves among the people, and say unto them, Bring mehither every man his ox, and every man his sheep, and slay [them] here,and eat; and sin not against the LORD in eating with the blood. And allthe people brought every man his ox with him that night, and slew[them] there. 

{14:35} And Saul built an altar unto the LORD: the samewas the first altar that he built unto the LORD.   

{14:36} And Saul said, Let us go down after the Philistines bynight, and spoil them until the morning light, and let us not leave aman of them. And they said, Do whatsoever seemeth good unto thee. Thensaid the priest, Let us draw near hither unto God. 

{14:37} And Saulasked counsel of God, Shall I go down after the Philistines? wilt thoudeliver them into the hand of Israel? But he answered him not that day.

{14:38} And Saul said, Draw ye near hither, all the chief of thepeople: and know and see wherein this sin hath been this day. 

{14:39}For, [as] the LORD liveth, which saveth Israel, though it be inJonathan my son, he shall surely die. But [there was] not a man amongall the people [that] answered him. 

{14:40} Then said he unto allIsrael, Be ye on one side, and I and Jonathan my son will be on theother side. And the people said unto Saul, Do what seemeth good untothee. 

{14:41} Therefore Saul said unto the LORD God of Israel, Give aperfect [lot.] And Saul and Jonathan were taken: but the peopleescaped. 

{14:42} And Saul said, Cast [lots] between me and Jonathan myson. And Jonathan was taken. 

{14:43} Then Saul said to Jonathan, Tellme what thou hast done. And Jonathan told him, and said, I did buttaste a little honey with the end of the rod that [was] in mine hand,[and,] lo, I must die. 

{14:44} And Saul answered, God do so and morealso: for thou shalt surely die, Jonathan. 

{14:45} And the people saidunto Saul, Shall Jonathan die, who hath wrought this great salvation inIsrael? God forbid: [as] the LORD liveth, there shall not one hair ofhis head fall to the ground; for he hath wrought with God this day. Sothe people rescued Jonathan, that he died not. 

{14:46} Then Saul wentup from following the Philistines: and the Philistines went to theirown place.   

{14:47} So Saul took the kingdom over Israel, and fought against allhis enemies on every side, against Moab, and against the children ofAmmon, and against Edom, and against the kings of Zobah, and againstthe Philistines: and whithersoever he turned himself, he vexed [them.]

{14:48} And he gathered an host, and smote the Amalekites, anddelivered Israel out of the hands of them that spoiled them. 

{14:49}Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan, and Ishui, and Melchi-shua: and thenames of his two daughters [were these;] the name of the firstbornMerab, and the name of the younger Michal: 

{14:50} And the name ofSaul's wife [was] Ahinoam, the daughter of Ahimaaz: and the name of thecaptain of his host [was] Abner, the son of Ner, Saul's uncle. 

{14:51}And Kish [was] the father of Saul; and Ner the father of Abner [was]the son of Abiel. 

{14:52} And there was sore war against thePhilistines all the days of Saul: and when Saul saw any strong man, orany valiant man, he took him unto him.   

{15:1} Samuel also said unto Saul, The LORD sent me to anoint thee[to be] king over his people, over Israel: now therefore hearken thouunto the voice of the words of the LORD. 

{15:2} Thus saith the LORD ofhosts, I remember [that] which Amalek did to Israel, how he laid [wait]for him in the way, when he came up from Egypt. 

{15:3} Now go and smiteAmalek, and utterly destroy all that they have, and spare them not; butslay both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel andass. 

{15:4} And Saul gathered the people together, and numbered them inTelaim, two hundred thousand footmen, and ten thousand men of Judah.

{15:5} And Saul came to a city of Amalek, and laid wait in the valley.   

{15:6} And Saul said unto the Kenites, Go, depart, get you down fromamong the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them: for ye shewedkindness to all the children of Israel, when they came up out of Egypt.So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites. 

{15:7} And Saulsmote the Amalekites from Havilah [until] thou comest to Shur, that[is] over against Egypt. 

{15:8} And he took Agag the king of theAmalekites alive, and utterly destroyed all the people with the edge ofthe sword. 

{15:9} But Saul and the people spared Agag, and the best ofthe sheep, and of the oxen, and of the fatlings, and the lambs, and all[that was] good, and would not utterly destroy them: but every thing[that was] vile and refuse, that they destroyed utterly.   

{15:10} Then came the word of the LORD unto Samuel, saying, 

{15:11}It repenteth me that I have set up Saul [to be] king: for he is turnedback from following me, and hath not performed my commandments. And itgrieved Samuel; and he cried unto the LORD all night. 

{15:12} And whenSamuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning, it was told Samuel,saying, Saul came to Carmel, and, behold, he set him up a place, and isgone about, and passed on, and gone down to Gilgal. 

{15:13} And Samuelcame to Saul: and Saul said unto him, Blessed [be] thou of the LORD: Ihave performed the commandment of the LORD. 

{15:14} And Samuel said,What [meaneth] then this bleating of the sheep in mine ears, and thelowing of the oxen which I hear? 

{15:15} And Saul said, They havebrought them from the Amalekites: for the people spared the best of thesheep and of the oxen, to sacrifice unto the LORD thy God; and the restwe have utterly destroyed. 

{15:16} Then Samuel said unto Saul, Stay,and I will tell thee what the LORD hath said to me this night. And hesaid unto him, Say on. 

{15:17} And Samuel said, When thou [wast] littlein thine own sight, [wast] thou not [made] the head of the tribes ofIsrael, and the LORD anointed thee king over Israel? 

{15:18} And theLORD sent thee on a journey, and said, Go and utterly destroy thesinners the Amalekites, and fight against them until they be consumed.

{15:19} Wherefore then didst thou not obey the voice of the LORD, butdidst fly upon the spoil, and didst evil in the sight of the LORD?

{15:20} And Saul said unto Samuel, Yea, I have obeyed the voice of theLORD, and have gone the way which the LORD sent me, and have broughtAgag the king of Amalek, and have utterly destroyed the Amalekites.

{15:21} But the people took of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the chief ofthe things which should have been utterly destroyed, to sacrifice untothe LORD thy God in Gilgal. 

{15:22} And Samuel said, Hath the LORD [asgreat] delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying thevoice of the LORD? Behold, to obey [is] better than sacrifice, [and] tohearken than the fat of rams. 

{15:23} For rebellion [is as] the sin ofwitchcraft, and stubbornness [is as] iniquity and idolatry. Becausethou hast rejected the word of the LORD, he hath also rejected theefrom [being] king.   

{15:24} And Saul said unto Samuel, I have sinned: for I havetransgressed the commandment of the LORD, and thy words: because Ifeared the people, and obeyed their voice. 

{15:25} Now therefore, Ipray thee, pardon my sin, and turn again with me, that I may worshipthe LORD. 

{15:26} And Samuel said unto Saul, I will not return withthee: for thou hast rejected the word of the LORD, and the LORD hathrejected thee from being king over Israel. 

{15:27} And as Samuel turnedabout to go away, he laid hold upon the skirt of his mantle, and itrent. 

{15:28} And Samuel said unto him, The LORD hath rent the kingdomof Israel from thee this day, and hath given it to a neighbour ofthine, [that is] better than thou. 

{15:29} And also the Strength ofIsrael will not lie nor repent: for he [is] not a man, that he shouldrepent. 

{15:30} Then he said, I have sinned: [yet] honour me now, Ipray thee, before the elders of my people, and before Israel, and turnagain with me, that I may worship the LORD thy God. 

{15:31} So Samuelturned again after Saul; and Saul worshipped the LORD.   

{15:32} Then said Samuel, Bring ye hither to me Agag the king of theAmalekites. And Agag came unto him delicately. And Agag said, Surelythe bitterness of death is past. 

{15:33} And Samuel said, As thy swordhath made women childless, so shall thy mother be childless amongwomen. And Samuel hewed Agag in pieces before the LORD in Gilgal.   

{15:34} Then Samuel went to Ramah; and Saul went up to his house toGibeah of Saul. 

{15:35} And Samuel came no more to see Saul until theday of his death: nevertheless Samuel mourned for Saul: and the LORDrepented that he had made Saul king over Israel.   

{16:1} And the LORD said unto Samuel, How long wilt thou mourn forSaul, seeing I have rejected him from reigning over Israel? fill thinehorn with oil, and go, I will send thee to Jesse the Bethlehemite: forI have provided me a king among his sons. 

{16:2} And Samuel said, Howcan I go? if Saul hear [it,] he will kill me. And the LORD said, Takean heifer with thee, and say, I am come to sacrifice to the LORD.

{16:3} And call Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will shew thee what thoushalt do: and thou shalt anoint unto me [him] whom I name unto thee.

{16:4} And Samuel did that which the LORD spake, and came to Bethlehem.And the elders of the town trembled at his coming, and said, Comestthou peaceably? 

{16:5} And he said, Peaceably: I am come to sacrificeunto the LORD: sanctify yourselves, and come with me to the sacrifice.And he sanctified Jesse and his sons, and called them to the sacrifice.   

{16:6} And it came to pass, when they were come, that he looked onEliab, and said, Surely the LORD'S anointed [is] before him. 

{16:7} Butthe LORD said unto Samuel, Look not on his countenance, or on theheight of his stature; because I have refused him: for [the LORD seeth]not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but theLORD looketh on the heart. 

{16:8} Then Jesse called Abinadab, and madehim pass before Samuel. And he said, Neither hath the LORD chosen this.

{16:9} Then Jesse made Shammah to pass by. And he said, Neither haththe LORD chosen this. 

{16:10} Again, Jesse made seven of his sons topass before Samuel. And Samuel said unto Jesse, The LORD hath notchosen these. 

{16:11} And Samuel said unto Jesse, Are here all [thy]children? And he said, There remaineth yet the youngest, and, behold,he keepeth the sheep. And Samuel said unto Jesse, Send and fetch him:for we will not sit down till he come hither. 

{16:12} And he sent, andbrought him in. Now he [was] ruddy, [and] withal of a beautifulcountenance, and goodly to look to. And the LORD said, Arise, anointhim: for this [is] he. 

{16:13} Then Samuel took the horn of oil, andanointed him in the midst of his brethren: and the Spirit of the LORDcame upon David from that day forward. So Samuel rose up, and went toRamah.   

{16:14} But the Spirit of the LORD departed from Saul, and an evilspirit from the LORD troubled him. 

{16:15} And Saul's servants saidunto him, Behold now, an evil spirit from God troubleth thee. 

{16:16}Let our lord now command thy servants, [which are] before thee, to seekout a man, [who is] a cunning player on an harp: and it shall come topass, when the evil spirit from God is upon thee, that he shall playwith his hand, and thou shalt be well. 

{16:17} And Saul said unto hisservants, Provide me now a man that can play well, and bring [him] tome. 

{16:18} Then answered one of the servants, and said, Behold, I haveseen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite, [that is] cunning in playing, anda mighty valiant man, and a man of war, and prudent in matters, and acomely person, and the LORD [is] with him.   

{16:19} Wherefore Saul sent messengers unto Jesse, and said, Send meDavid thy son, which [is] with the sheep. 

{16:20} And Jesse took an ass[laden] with bread, and a bottle of wine, and a kid, and sent [them] byDavid his son unto Saul. 

{16:21} And David came to Saul, and stoodbefore him: and he loved him greatly; and he became his armourbearer.

{16:22} And Saul sent to Jesse, saying, Let David, I pray thee, standbefore me; for he hath found favour in my sight. 

{16:23} And it came topass, when the [evil] spirit from God was upon Saul, that David took anharp, and played with his hand: so Saul was refreshed, and was well,and the evil spirit departed from him.   

{17:1} Now the Philistines gathered together their armies to battle,and were gathered together at Shochoh, which [belongeth] to Judah, andpitched between Shochoh and Azekah, in Ephes-dammim. 

{17:2} And Sauland the men of Israel were gathered together, and pitched by the valleyof Elah, and set the battle in array against the Philistines. 

{17:3}And the Philistines stood on a mountain on the one side, and Israelstood on a mountain on the other side: and [there was] a valley betweenthem.   

{17:4} And there went out a champion out of the camp of thePhilistines, named Goliath, of Gath, whose height [was] six cubits anda span. 

{17:5} And [he had] an helmet of brass upon his head, and he[was] armed with a coat of mail; and the weight of the coat [was] fivethousand shekels of brass. 

{17:6} And [he had] greaves of brass uponhis legs, and a target of brass between his shoulders. 

{17:7} And thestaff of his spear [was] like a weaver's beam; and his spear's head[weighed] six hundred shekels of iron: and one bearing a shield wentbefore him. 

{17:8} And he stood and cried unto the armies of Israel,and said unto them, Why are ye come out to set [your] battle in array?[am] not I a Philistine, and ye servants to Saul? choose you a man foryou, and let him come down to me. 

{17:9} If he be able to fight withme, and to kill me, then will we be your servants: but if I prevailagainst him, and kill him, then shall ye be our servants, and serve us.

{17:10} And the Philistine said, I defy the armies of Israel this day;give me a man, that we may fight together. 

{17:11} When Saul and allIsrael heard those words of the Philistine, they were dismayed, andgreatly afraid.   

{17:12} Now David [was] the son of that Ephrathite ofBethlehemjudah, whose name [was] Jesse; and he had eight sons: and theman went among men [for] an old man in the days of Saul. 

{17:13} Andthe three eldest sons of Jesse went [and] followed Saul to the battle:and the names of his three sons that went to the battle [were] Eliabthe first born, and next unto him Abinadab, and the third Shammah.

{17:14} And David [was] the youngest: and the three eldest followedSaul. 

{17:15} But David went and returned from Saul to feed hisfather's sheep at Bethlehem. 

{17:16} And the Philistine drew nearmorning and evening, and presented himself forty days. 

{17:17} AndJesse said unto David his son, Take now for thy brethren an ephah ofthis parched [corn,] and these ten loaves, and run to the camp to thybrethren; 

{17:18} And carry these ten cheeses unto the captain of[their] thousand, and look how thy brethren fare, and take theirpledge. 

{17:19} Now Saul, and they, and all the men of Israel, [were]in the valley of Elah, fighting with the Philistines.   

{17:20} And David rose up early in the morning, and left the sheepwith a keeper, and took, and went, as Jesse had commanded him; and hecame to the trench, as the host was going forth to the fight, andshouted for the battle. 

{17:21} For Israel and the Philistines had putthe battle in array, army against army. 

{17:22} And David left hiscarriage in the hand of the keeper of the carriage, and ran into thearmy, and came and saluted his brethren. 

{17:23} And as he talked withthem, behold, there came up the champion, the Philistine of Gath,Goliath by name, out of the armies of the Philistines, and spakeaccording to the same words: and David heard [them. ]

{17:24} And allthe men of Israel, when they saw the man, fled from him, and were soreafraid. 

{17:25} And the men of Israel said, Have ye seen this man thatis come up? surely to defy Israel is he come up: and it shall be,[that] the man who killeth him, the king will enrich him with greatriches, and will give him his daughter, and make his father's housefree in Israel. 

{17:26} And David spake to the men that stood by him,saying, What shall be done to the man that killeth this Philistine, andtaketh away the reproach from Israel? for who [is] this uncircumcisedPhilistine, that he should defy the armies of the living God? 

{17:27}And the people answered him after this manner, saying, So shall it bedone to the man that killeth him.   

{17:28} And Eliab his eldest brother heard when he spake unto themen; and Eliab's anger was kindled against David, and he said, Whycamest thou down hither? and with whom hast thou left those few sheepin the wilderness? I know thy pride, and the naughtiness of thineheart; for thou art come down that thou mightest see the battle.

{17:29} And David said, What have I now done? [Is there] not a cause?   

{17:30} And he turned from him toward another, and spake after thesame manner: and the people answered him again after the former manner.

{17:31} And when the words were heard which David spake, they rehearsed[them] before Saul: and he sent for him.   

{17:32} And David said to Saul, Let no man's heart fail because ofhim; thy servant will go and fight with this Philistine. 

{17:33} AndSaul said to David, Thou art not able to go against this Philistine tofight with him: for thou [art but] a youth, and he a man of war fromhis youth. 

{17:34} And David said unto Saul, Thy servant kept hisfather's sheep, and there came a lion, and a bear, and took a lamb outof the flock: 

{17:35} And I went out after him, and smote him, anddelivered [it] out of his mouth: and when he arose against me, I caught[him] by his beard, and smote him, and slew him. 

{17:36} Thy servantslew both the lion and the bear: and this uncircumcised Philistineshall be as one of them, seeing he hath defied the armies of the livingGod. 

{17:37} David said moreover, The LORD that delivered me out of thepaw of the lion, and out of the paw of the bear, he will deliver me outof the hand of this Philistine. And Saul said unto David, Go, and theLORD be with thee.   

{17:38} And Saul armed David with his armour, and he put an helmetof brass upon his head; also he armed him with a coat of mail. 

{17:39}And David girded his sword upon his armour, and he assayed to go; forhe had not proved [it.] And David said unto Saul, I cannot go withthese; for I have not proved [them.] And David put them off him.

{17:40} And he took his staff in his hand, and chose him five smoothstones out of the brook, and put them in a shepherd's bag which he had,even in a scrip; and his sling [was] in his hand: and he drew near tothe Philistine. 

{17:41} And the Philistine came on and drew near untoDavid; and the man that bare the shield [went] before him. 

{17:42} Andwhen the Philistine looked about, and saw David, he disdained him: forhe was [but] a youth, and ruddy, and of a fair countenance. 

{17:43} Andthe Philistine said unto David, [Am] I a dog, that thou comest to mewith staves? And the Philistine cursed David by his gods. 

{17:44} Andthe Philistine said to David, Come to me, and I will give thy fleshunto the fowls of the air, and to the beasts of the field. 

{17:45} Thensaid David to the Philistine, Thou comest to me with a sword, and witha spear, and with a shield: but I come to thee in the name of the LORDof hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom thou hast defied.

{17:46} This day will the LORD deliver thee into mine hand; and I willsmite thee, and take thine head from thee; and I will give the carcasesof the host of the Philistines this day unto the fowls of the air, andto the wild beasts of the earth; that all the earth may know that thereis a God in Israel. 

{17:47} And all this assembly shall know that theLORD saveth not with sword and spear: for the battle [is] the LORD'S,and he will give you into our hands. 

{17:48} And it came to pass, whenthe Philistine arose, and came and drew nigh to meet David, that Davidhasted, and ran toward the army to meet the Philistine. 

{17:49} AndDavid put his hand in his bag, and took thence a stone, and slang [it,]and smote the Philistine in his forehead, that the stone sunk into hisforehead; and he fell upon his face to the earth. 

{17:50} So Davidprevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a stone, and smotethe Philistine, and slew him; but [there was] no sword in the hand ofDavid. 

{17:51} Therefore David ran, and stood upon the Philistine, andtook his sword, and drew it out of the sheath thereof, and slew him,and cut off his head therewith. And when the Philistines saw theirchampion was dead, they fled. 

{17:52} And the men of Israel and ofJudah arose, and shouted, and pursued the Philistines, until thou cometo the valley, and to the gates of Ekron. And the wounded of thePhilistines fell down by the way to Shaaraim, even unto Gath, and untoEkron. 

{17:53} And the children of Israel returned from chasing afterthe Philistines, and they spoiled their tents. 

{17:54} And David tookthe head of the Philistine, and brought it to Jerusalem; but he put hisarmour in his tent.   

{17:55} And when Saul saw David go forth against the Philistine, hesaid unto Abner, the captain of the host, Abner, whose son [is] thisyouth? And Abner said, [As] thy soul liveth, O king, I cannot tell.

{17:56} And the king said, Enquire thou whose son the stripling [is.]

{17:57} And as David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine,Abner took him, and brought him before Saul with the head of thePhilistine in his hand. 

{17:58} And Saul said to him, Whose son [art]thou, [thou] young man? And David answered, [I am] the son of thyservant Jesse the Bethlehemite.   

{18:1} And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking untoSaul, that the soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of David, andJonathan loved him as his own soul. 

{18:2} And Saul took him that day,and would let him go no more home to his father's house. 

{18:3} ThenJonathan and David made a covenant, because he loved him as his ownsoul. 

{18:4} And Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that [was] uponhim, and gave it to David, and his garments, even to his sword, and tohis bow, and to his girdle.   

{18:5} And David went out whithersoever Saul sent him, [and] behavedhimself wisely: and Saul set him over the men of war, and he wasaccepted in the sight of all the people, and also in the sight ofSaul's servants. 

{18:6} And it came to pass as they came, when Davidwas returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, that the women cameout of all cities of Israel, singing and dancing, to meet king Saul,with tabrets, with joy, and with instruments of musick. 

{18:7} And thewomen answered [one another] as they played, and said, Saul hath slainhis thousands, and David his ten thousands. 

{18:8} And Saul was verywroth, and the saying displeased him; and he said, They have ascribedunto David ten thousands, and to me they have ascribed [but] thousands:and [what] can he have more but the kingdom? 

{18:9} And Saul eyed Davidfrom that day and forward. 

{18:10} And it came to pass on the morrow,that the evil spirit from God came upon Saul, and he prophesied in themidst of the house: and David played with his hand, as at other times:and [there was] a javelin in Saul's hand. 

{18:11} And Saul cast thejavelin; for he said, I will smite David even to the wall [with it.]And David avoided out of his presence twice.   

{18:12} And Saul was afraid of David, because the LORD was with him,and was departed from Saul. 

{18:13} Therefore Saul removed him fromhim, and made him his captain over a thousand; and he went out and camein before the people. 

{18:14} And David behaved himself wisely in allhis ways; and the LORD [was] with him. 

{18:15} Wherefore when Saul sawthat he behaved himself very wisely, he was afraid of him. 

{18:16} Butall Israel and Judah loved David, because he went out and came inbefore them.   

{18:17} And Saul said to David, Behold my elder daughter Merab, herwill I give thee to wife: only be thou valiant for me, and fight theLORD'S battles. For Saul said, Let not mine hand be upon him, but letthe hand of the Philistines be upon him. 

{18:18} And David said untoSaul, Who [am] I? and what [is] my life, [or] my father's family inIsrael, that I should be son in law to the king? 

{18:19} But it came topass at the time when Merab Saul's daughter should have been given toDavid, that she was given unto Adriel the Meholathite to wife. 

{18:20}And Michal Saul's daughter loved David: and they told Saul, and thething pleased him. 

{18:21} And Saul said, I will give him her, that shemay be a snare to him, and that the hand of the Philistines may beagainst him. Wherefore Saul said to David, Thou shalt this day be myson in law in [the one of] the twain.   

{18:22} And Saul commanded his servants, [saying,] Commune withDavid secretly, and say, Behold, the king hath delight in thee, and allhis servants love thee: now therefore be the king's son in law. 

{18:23}And Saul's servants spake those words in the ears of David. And Davidsaid, Seemeth it to you [a] light [thing] to be a king's son in law,seeing that I [am] a poor man, and lightly esteemed? 

{18:24} And theservants of Saul told him, saying, On this manner spake David. 

{18:25}And Saul said, Thus shall ye say to David, The king desireth not anydowry, but an hundred foreskins of the Philistines, to be avenged ofthe king's enemies. But Saul thought to make David fall by the hand ofthe Philistines. 

{18:26} And when his servants told David these words,it pleased David well to be the king's son in law: and the days werenot expired. 

{18:27} Wherefore David arose and went, he and his men,and slew of the Philistines two hundred men; and David brought theirforeskins, and they gave them in full tale to the king, that he mightbe the king's son in law. And Saul gave him Michal his daughter to wife.   

{18:28} And Saul saw and knew that the LORD [was] with David, and[that] Michal Saul's daughter loved him. 

{18:29} And Saul was yet themore afraid of David; and Saul became David's enemy continually.

{18:30} Then the princes of the Philistines went forth: and it came topass, after they went forth, [that] David behaved himself more wiselythan all the servants of Saul; so that his name was much set by.   

{19:1} And Saul spake to Jonathan his son, and to all his servants,that they should kill David. 

{19:2} But Jonathan Saul's son delightedmuch in David: and Jonathan told David, saying, Saul my father seekethto kill thee: now therefore, I pray thee, take heed to thyself untilthe morning, and abide in a secret [place,] and hide thyself: 

{19:3}And I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where thou[art,] and I will commune with my father of thee; and what I see, thatI will tell thee.   

{19:4} And Jonathan spake good of David unto Saul his father, andsaid unto him, Let not the king sin against his servant, against David;because he hath not sinned against thee, and because his works [havebeen] to thee-ward very good: 

{19:5} For he did put his life in hishand, and slew the Philistine, and the LORD wrought a great salvationfor all Israel: thou sawest [it,] and didst rejoice: wherefore thenwilt thou sin against innocent blood, to slay David without a cause?

{19:6} And Saul hearkened unto the voice of Jonathan: and Saul sware,[As] the LORD liveth, he shall not be slain. 

{19:7} And Jonathan calledDavid, and Jonathan shewed him all those things. And Jonathan broughtDavid to Saul, and he was in his presence, as in times past.   

{19:8} And there was war again: and David went out, and fought withthe Philistines, and slew them with a great slaughter; and they fledfrom him. 

{19:9} And the evil spirit from the LORD was upon Saul, as hesat in his house with his javelin in his hand: and David played with[his] hand. 

{19:10} And Saul sought to smite David even to the wallwith the javelin; but he slipped away out of Saul's presence, and hesmote the javelin into the wall: and David fled, and escaped thatnight. 

{19:11} Saul also sent messengers unto David's house, to watchhim, and to slay him in the morning: and Michal David's wife told him,saying, If thou save not thy life to night, to morrow thou shalt beslain.   

{19:12} So Michal let David down through a window: and he went, andfled, and escaped. 

{19:13} And Michal took an image, and laid [it] inthe bed, and put a pillow of goats [hair] for his bolster, and covered[it] with a cloth. 

{19:14} And when Saul sent messengers to take David,she said, He [is] sick. 

{19:15} And Saul sent the messengers [again] tosee David, saying, Bring him up to me in the bed, that I may slay him.

{19:16} And when the messengers were come in, behold, [there was] animage in the bed, with a pillow of goats' [hair] for his bolster.

{19:17} And Saul said unto Michal, Why hast thou deceived me so, andsent away mine enemy, that he is escaped? And Michal answered Saul, Hesaid unto me, Let me go; why should I kill thee?   

{19:18} So David fled, and escaped, and came to Samuel to Ramah, andtold him all that Saul had done to him. And he and Samuel went anddwelt in Naioth. 

{19:19} And it was told Saul, saying, Behold, David[is] at Naioth in Ramah. 

{19:20} And Saul sent messengers to takeDavid: and when they saw the company of the prophets prophesying, andSamuel standing [as] appointed over them, the Spirit of God was uponthe messengers of Saul, and they also prophesied. 

{19:21} And when itwas told Saul, he sent other messengers, and they prophesied likewise.And Saul sent messengers again the third time, and they prophesiedalso. 

{19:22} Then went he also to Ramah, and came to a great well that[is] in Sechu: and he asked and said, Where [are] Samuel and David? And[one] said, Behold, [they be] at Naioth in Ramah. 

{19:23} And he wentthither to Naioth in Ramah: and the Spirit of God was upon him also,and he went on, and prophesied, until he came to Naioth in Ramah.

{19:24} And he stript off his clothes also, and prophesied beforeSamuel in like manner, and lay down naked all that day and all thatnight. Wherefore they say, [Is] Saul also among the prophets?   

{20:1} And David fled from Naioth in Ramah, and came and said beforeJonathan, What have I done? what [is] mine iniquity? and what [is] mysin before thy father, that he seeketh my life? 

{20:2} And he said untohim, God forbid; thou shalt not die: behold, my father will do nothingeither great or small, but that he will shew it me: and why should myfather hide this thing from me? it [is] not [so. ]

{20:3} And Davidsware moreover, and said, Thy father certainly knoweth that I havefound grace in thine eyes; and he saith, Let not Jonathan know this,lest he be grieved: but truly [as] the LORD liveth, and [as] thy soulliveth, [there is] but a step between me and death. 

{20:4} Then saidJonathan unto David, Whatsoever thy soul desireth, I will even do [it]for thee. 

{20:5} And David said unto Jonathan, Behold, to morrow [is]the new moon, and I should not fail to sit with the king at meat: butlet me go, that I may hide myself in the field unto the third [day] ateven. 

{20:6} If thy father at all miss me, then say, David earnestlyasked [leave] of me that he might run to Bethlehem his city: for [thereis] a yearly sacrifice there for all the family. 

{20:7} If he say thus,[It is] well; thy servant shall have peace: but if he be very wroth,[then] be sure that evil is determined by him. 

{20:8} Therefore thoushalt deal kindly with thy servant; for thou hast brought thy servantinto a covenant of the LORD with thee: notwithstanding, if there be inme iniquity, slay me thyself; for why shouldest thou bring me to thyfather? 

{20:9} And Jonathan said, Far be it from thee: for if I knewcertainly that evil were determined by my father to come upon thee,then would not I tell it thee? 

{20:10} Then said David to Jonathan, Whoshall tell me? or what [if] thy father answer thee roughly?   

{20:11} And Jonathan said unto David, Come, and let us go out intothe field. And they went out both of them into the field. 

{20:12} AndJonathan said unto David, O LORD God of Israel, when I have sounded myfather about to morrow any time, [or] the third [day,] and, behold, [ifthere be] good toward David, and I then send not unto thee, and shew itthee; 

{20:13} The LORD do so and much more to Jonathan: but if itplease my father [to do] thee evil, then I will shew it thee, and sendthee away, that thou mayest go in peace: and the LORD be with thee, ashe hath been with my father. 

{20:14} And thou shalt not only while yetI live shew me the kindness of the LORD, that I die not: 

{20:15} But[also] thou shalt not cut off thy kindness from my house for ever: no,not when the LORD hath cut off the enemies of David every one from theface of the earth. 

{20:16} So Jonathan made [a covenant] with the houseof David, [saying,] Let the LORD even require [it] at the hand ofDavid's enemies. 

{20:17} And Jonathan caused David to swear again,because he loved him: for he loved him as he loved his own soul.

{20:18} Then Jonathan said to David, To morrow [is] the new moon: andthou shalt be missed, because thy seat will be empty. 

{20:19} And[when] thou hast stayed three days, [then] thou shalt go down quickly,and come to the place where thou didst hide thyself when the businesswas [in hand,] and shalt remain by the stone Ezel. 

{20:20} And I willshoot three arrows on the side [thereof,] as though I shot at a mark.

{20:21} And, behold, I will send a lad, [saying,] Go, find out thearrows. If I expressly say unto the lad, Behold, the arrows are on thisside of thee, take them; then come thou: for [there is] peace to thee,and no hurt; [as] the LORD liveth. 

{20:22} But if I say thus unto theyoung man, Behold, the arrows [are] beyond thee; go thy way: for theLORD hath sent thee away. 

{20:23} And [as touching] the matter whichthou and I have spoken of, behold, the LORD [be] between thee and mefor ever.   

{20:24} So David hid himself in the field: and when the new moon wascome, the king sat him down to eat meat. 

{20:25} And the king sat uponhis seat, as at other times, [even] upon a seat by the wall: andJonathan arose, and Abner sat by Saul's side, and David's place wasempty. 

{20:26} Nevertheless Saul spake not any thing that day: for hethought, Something hath befallen him, he is not clean; surely he [is]not clean. 

{20:27} And it came to pass on the morrow, [which was] thesecond [day] of the month, that David's place was empty: and Saul saidunto Jonathan his son, Wherefore cometh not the son of Jesse to meat,neither yesterday, nor to day? 

{20:28} And Jonathan answered Saul,David earnestly asked [leave] of me [to go] to Bethlehem: 

{20:29} Andhe said, Let me go, I pray thee; for our family hath a sacrifice in thecity; and my brother, he hath commanded me [to be there:] and now, if Ihave found favour in thine eyes, let me get away, I pray thee, and seemy brethren. Therefore he cometh not unto the king's table. 

{20:30}Then Saul's anger was kindled against Jonathan, and he said unto him,Thou son of the perverse rebellious [woman,] do not I know that thouhast chosen the son of Jesse to thine own confusion, and unto theconfusion of thy mother's nakedness? 

{20:31} For as long as the son ofJesse liveth upon the ground, thou shalt not be established, nor thykingdom. Wherefore now send and fetch him unto me, for he shall surelydie. 

{20:32} And Jonathan answered Saul his father, and said unto him,Wherefore shall he be slain? what hath he done? 

{20:33} And Saul cast ajavelin at him to smite him: whereby Jonathan knew that it wasdetermined of his father to slay David. 

{20:34} So Jonathan arose fromthe table in fierce anger, and did eat no meat the second day of themonth: for he was grieved for David, because his father had done himshame.   

{20:35} And it came to pass in the morning, that Jonathan went outinto the field at the time appointed with David, and a little lad withhim. 

{20:36} And he said unto his lad, Run, find out now the arrowswhich I shoot. [And] as the lad ran, he shot an arrow beyond him.

{20:37} And when the lad was come to the place of the arrow whichJonathan had shot, Jonathan cried after the lad, and said, [Is] not thearrow beyond thee? 

{20:38} And Jonathan cried after the lad, Makespeed, haste, stay not. And Jonathan's lad gathered up the arrows, andcame to his master. 

{20:39} But the lad knew not any thing: onlyJonathan and David knew the matter. 

{20:40} And Jonathan gave hisartillery unto his lad, and said unto him, Go, carry [them] to the city.   

{20:41} [And] as soon as the lad was gone, David arose out of [aplace] toward the south, and fell on his face to the ground, and bowedhimself three times: and they kissed one another, and wept one withanother, until David exceeded. 

{20:42} And Jonathan said to David, Goin peace, forasmuch as we have sworn both of us in the name of theLORD, saying, The LORD be between me and thee, and between my seed andthy seed for ever. And he arose and departed: and Jonathan went intothe city.   

{21:1} Then came David to Nob to Ahimelech the priest: and Ahimelechwas afraid at the meeting of David, and said unto him, Why [art] thoualone, and no man with thee? 

{21:2} And David said unto Ahimelech thepriest, The king hath commanded me a business, and hath said unto me,Let no man know any thing of the business whereabout I send thee, andwhat I have commanded thee: and I have appointed [my] servants to suchand such a place. 

{21:3} Now therefore what is under thine hand? give[me] five [loaves of] bread in mine hand, or what there is present.

{21:4} And the priest answered David, and said, [There is] no commonbread under mine hand, but there is hallowed bread; if the young menhave kept themselves at least from women. 

{21:5} And David answered thepriest, and said unto him, Of a truth women [have been] kept from usabout these three days, since I came out, and the vessels of the youngmen are holy, and [the bread is] in a manner common, yea, though itwere sanctified this day in the vessel. 

{21:6} So the priest gave himhallowed [bread:] for there was no bread there but the shewbread, thatwas taken from before the LORD, to put hot bread in the day when it wastaken away. 

{21:7} Now a certain man of the servants of Saul [was]there that day, detained before the LORD; and his name [was] Doeg, anEdomite, the chiefest of the herdmen that [belonged] to Saul.   

{21:8} And David said unto Ahimelech, And is there not here underthine hand spear or sword? for I have neither brought my sword nor myweapons with me, because the king's business required haste. 

{21:9} Andthe priest said, The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom thou slewestin the valley of Elah, behold, it [is here] wrapped in a cloth behindthe ephod: if thou wilt take that, take [it:] for [there is] no othersave that here. And David said, [There is] none like that; give it me.   

{21:10} And David arose, and fled that day for fear of Saul, andwent to Achish the king of Gath. 

{21:11} And the servants of Achishsaid unto him, [Is] not this David the king of the land? did they notsing one to another of him in dances, saying, Saul hath slain histhousands, and David his ten thousands? 

{21:12} And David laid up thesewords in his heart, and was sore afraid of Achish the king of Gath.

{21:13} And he changed his behaviour before them, and feigned himselfmad in their hands, and scrabbled on the doors of the gate, and let hisspittle fall down upon his beard. 

{21:14} Then said Achish unto hisservants, Lo, ye see the man is mad: wherefore [then] have ye broughthim to me? 

{21:15} Have I need of mad men, that ye have brought this[fellow] to play the mad man in my presence? shall this [fellow] comeinto my house?   

{22:1} David therefore departed thence, and escaped to the caveAdullam: and when his brethren and all his father's house heard it,they went down thither to him. 

{22:2} And every one [that was] indistress, and every one that [was] in debt, and every one [that was]discontented, gathered themselves unto him; and he became a captainover them: and there were with him about four hundred men.   

{22:3} And David went thence to Mizpeh of Moab: and he said unto theking of Moab, Let my father and my mother, I pray thee, come forth,[and be] with you, till I know what God will do for me. 

{22:4} And hebrought them before the king of Moab: and they dwelt with him all thewhile that David was in the hold.   

{22:5} And the prophet Gad said unto David, Abide not in the hold;depart, and get thee into the land of Judah. Then David departed, andcame into the forest of Hareth.   

{22:6} When Saul heard that David was discovered, and the men that[were] with him, (now Saul abode in Gibeah under a tree in Ramah,having his spear in his hand, and all his servants [were] standingabout him;) 

{22:7} Then Saul said unto his servants that stood abouthim, Hear now, ye Benjamites; will the son of Jesse give every one ofyou fields and vineyards, [and] make you all captains of thousands, andcaptains of hundreds; 

{22:8} That all of you have conspired against me,and [there is] none that sheweth me that my son hath made a league withthe son of Jesse, and [there is] none of you that is sorry for me, orsheweth unto me that my son hath stirred up my servant against me, tolie in wait, as at this day?   

{22:9} Then answered Doeg the Edomite, which was set over theservants of Saul, and said, I saw the son of Jesse coming to Nob, toAhimelech the son of Ahitub. 

{22:10} And he enquired of the LORD forhim, and gave him victuals, and gave him the sword of Goliath thePhilistine. 

{22:11} Then the king sent to call Ahimelech the priest,the son of Ahitub, and all his father's house, the priests that [were]in Nob: and they came all of them to the king. 

{22:12} And Saul said,Hear now, thou son of Ahitub. And he answered, Here I [am,] my lord.

{22:13} And Saul said unto him, Why have ye conspired against me, thouand the son of Jesse, in that thou hast given him bread, and a sword,and hast enquired of God for him, that he should rise against me, tolie in wait, as at this day? 

{22:14} Then Ahimelech answered the king,and said, And who [is so] faithful among all thy servants as David,which is the king's son in law, and goeth at thy bidding, and ishonourable in thine house? 

{22:15} Did I then begin to enquire of Godfor him? be it far from me: let not the king impute [any] thing untohis servant, [nor] to all the house of my father: for thy servant knewnothing of all this, less or more. 

{22:16} And the king said, Thoushalt surely die, Ahimelech, thou, and all thy father's house.   

{22:17} And the king said unto the footmen that stood about him,Turn, and slay the priests of the LORD; because their hand also [is]with David, and because they knew when he fled, and did not shew it tome. But the servants of the king would not put forth their hand to fallupon the priests of the LORD. 

{22:18} And the king said to Doeg, Turnthou, and fall upon the priests. And Doeg the Edomite turned, and hefell upon the priests, and slew on that day fourscore and five personsthat did wear a linen ephod. 

{22:19} And Nob, the city of the priests,smote he with the edge of the sword, both men and women, children andsucklings, and oxen, and asses, and sheep, with the edge of the sword.   

{22:20} And one of the sons of Ahimelech the son of Ahitub, namedAbiathar, escaped, and fled after David. 

{22:21} And Abiathar shewedDavid that Saul had slain the LORD'S priests. 

{22:22} And David saidunto Abiathar, I knew [it] that day, when Doeg the Edomite [was] there,that he would surely tell Saul: I have occasioned [the death] of allthe persons of thy father's house. 

{22:23} Abide thou with me, fearnot: for he that seeketh my life seeketh thy life: but with me thou[shalt be] in safeguard.   

{23:1} Then they told David, saying, Behold, the Philistines fightagainst Keilah, and they rob the threshingfloors. 

{23:2} ThereforeDavid enquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go and smite thesePhilistines? And the LORD said unto David, Go, and smite thePhilistines, and save Keilah. 

{23:3} And David's men said unto him,Behold, we be afraid here in Judah: how much more then if we come toKeilah against the armies of the Philistines? 

{23:4} Then Davidenquired of the LORD yet again. And the LORD answered him and said,Arise, go down to Keilah; for I will deliver the Philistines into thinehand. 

{23:5} So David and his men went to Keilah, and fought with thePhilistines, and brought away their cattle, and smote them with a greatslaughter. So David saved the inhabitants of Keilah. 

{23:6} And it cameto pass, when Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled to David to Keilah,[that] he came down [with] an ephod in his hand.   

{23:7} And it was told Saul that David was come to Keilah. And Saulsaid, God hath delivered him into mine hand; for he is shut in, byentering into a town that hath gates and bars. 

{23:8} And Saul calledall the people together to war, to go down to Keilah, to besiege Davidand his men.   

{23:9} And David knew that Saul secretly practised mischief againsthim; and he said to Abiathar the priest, Bring hither the ephod.

{23:10} Then said David, O LORD God of Israel, thy servant hathcertainly heard that Saul seeketh to come to Keilah, to destroy thecity for my sake. 

{23:11} Will the men of Keilah deliver me up into hishand? will Saul come down, as thy servant hath heard? O LORD God ofIsrael, I beseech thee, tell thy servant. And the LORD said, He willcome down. 

{23:12} Then said David, Will the men of Keilah deliver meand my men into the hand of Saul? And the LORD said, They will deliver[thee] up.   

{23:13} Then David and his men, [which were] about six hundred,arose and departed out of Keilah, and went whithersoever they could go.And it was told Saul that David was escaped from Keilah; and he forbareto go forth. 

{23:14} And David abode in the wilderness in strong holds,and remained in a mountain in the wilderness of Ziph. And Saul soughthim every day, but God delivered him not into his hand. 

{23:15} AndDavid saw that Saul was come out to seek his life: and David [was] inthe wilderness of Ziph in a wood.   

{23:16} And Jonathan Saul's son arose, and went to David into thewood, and strengthened his hand in God. 

{23:17} And he said unto him,Fear not: for the hand of Saul my father shall not find thee; and thoushalt be king over Israel, and I shall be next unto thee; and that alsoSaul my father knoweth. 

{23:18} And they two made a covenant before theLORD: and David abode in the wood, and Jonathan went to his house.   

{23:19} Then came up the Ziphites to Saul to Gibeah, saying, Dothnot David hide himself with us in strong holds in the wood, in the hillof Hachilah, which [is] on the south of Jeshimon? 

{23:20} Nowtherefore, O king, come down according to all the desire of thy soul tocome down; and our part [shall be] to deliver him into the king's hand.

{23:21} And Saul said, Blessed [be] ye of the LORD; for ye havecompassion on me. 

{23:22} Go, I pray you, prepare yet, and know and seehis place where his haunt is, [and] who hath seen him there: for it istold me [that] he dealeth very subtilly. 

{23:23} See therefore, andtake knowledge of all the lurking places where he hideth himself, andcome ye again to me with the certainty, and I will go with you: and itshall come to pass, if he be in the land, that I will search him outthroughout all the thousands of Judah. 

{23:24} And they arose, and wentto Ziph before Saul: but David and his men [were] in the wilderness ofMaon, in the plain on the south of Jeshimon. 

{23:25} Saul also and hismen went to seek [him.] And they told David: wherefore he came downinto a rock, and abode in the wilderness of Maon. And when Saul heard[that,] he pursued after David in the wilderness of Maon. 

{23:26} AndSaul went on this side of the mountain, and David and his men on thatside of the mountain: and David made haste to get away for fear ofSaul; for Saul and his men compassed David and his men round about totake them.   

{23:27} But there came a messenger unto Saul, saying, Haste thee,and come; for the Philistines have invaded the land. 

{23:28} WhereforeSaul returned from pursuing after David, and went against thePhilistines: therefore they called that place Sela- hammahlekoth.   

{23:29} And David went up from thence, and dwelt in strong holds atEn-gedi.   

{24:1} And it came to pass, when Saul was returned from followingthe Philistines, that it was told him, saying, Behold, David is in thewilderness of En-gedi. 

{24:2} Then Saul took three thousand chosen menout of all Israel, and went to seek David and his men upon the rocks ofthe wild goats. 

{24:3} And he came to the sheepcotes by the way, where[was] a cave; and Saul went in to cover his feet: and David and his menremained in the sides of the cave. 

{24:4} And the men of David saidunto him, Behold the day of which the LORD said unto thee, Behold, Iwill deliver thine enemy into thine hand, that thou mayest do to him asit shall seem good unto thee. Then David arose, and cut off the skirtof Saul's robe privily. 

{24:5} And it came to pass afterward, thatDavid's heart smote him, because he had cut off Saul's skirt. 

{24:6}And he said unto his men, The LORD forbid that I should do this thingunto my master, the LORD'S anointed, to stretch forth mine hand againsthim, seeing he is the anointed of the LORD. 

{24:7} So David stayed hisservants with these words, and suffered them not to rise against Saul.But Saul rose up out of the cave, and went on [his] way. 

{24:8} Davidalso arose afterward, and went out of the cave, and cried after Saul,saying, My lord the king. And when Saul looked behind him, Davidstooped with his face to the earth, and bowed himself.   

{24:9} And David said to Saul, Wherefore hearest thou men's words,saying, Behold, David seeketh thy hurt? 

{24:10} Behold, this day thineeyes have seen how that the LORD had delivered thee to day into minehand in the cave: and [some] bade [me] kill thee: but [mine eye] sparedthee; and I said, I will not put forth mine hand against my lord; forhe [is] the LORD'S anointed. 

{24:11} Moreover, my father, see, yea, seethe skirt of thy robe in my hand: for in that I cut off the skirt ofthy robe and killed thee not, know thou and see that [there is] neitherevil nor transgression in mine hand, and I have not sinned againstthee; yet thou huntest my soul to take it. 

{24:12} The LORD judgebetween me and thee, and the LORD avenge me of thee: but mine handshall not be upon thee. 

{24:13} As saith the proverb of the ancients,Wickedness proceedeth from the wicked: but mine hand shall not be uponthee. 

{24:14} After whom is the king of Israel come out? after whomdost thou pursue? after a dead dog, after a flea. 

{24:15} The LORDtherefore be judge, and judge between me and thee, and see, and pleadmy cause, and deliver me out of thine hand.   

{24:16} And it came to pass, when David had made an end of speakingthese words unto Saul, that Saul said, [Is] this thy voice, my sonDavid? And Saul lifted up his voice, and wept. 

{24:17} And he said toDavid, Thou [art] more righteous than I: for thou hast rewarded megood, whereas I have rewarded thee evil. 

{24:18} And thou hast shewedthis day how that thou hast dealt well with me: forasmuch as when theLORD had delivered me into thine hand, thou killedst me not. 

{24:19}For if a man find his enemy, will he let him go well away? whereforethe LORD reward thee good for that thou hast done unto me this day.

{24:20} And now, behold, I know well that thou shalt surely be king,and that the kingdom of Israel shall be established in thine hand.

{24:21} Swear now therefore unto me by the LORD, that thou wilt not cutoff my seed after me, and that thou wilt not destroy my name out of myfather's house. 

{24:22} And David sware unto Saul. And Saul went home;but David and his men gat them up unto the hold.   

{25:1} And Samuel died; and all the Israelites were gatheredtogether, and lamented him, and buried him in his house at Ramah. AndDavid arose, and went down to the wilderness of Paran. 

{25:2} And[there was] a man in Maon, whose possessions [were] in Carmel; and theman [was] very great, and he had three thousand sheep, and a thousandgoats: and he was shearing his sheep in Carmel. 

{25:3} Now the name ofthe man [was] Nabal; and the name of his wife Abigail: and [she was] awoman of good understanding, and of a beautiful countenance: but theman [was] churlish and evil in his doings; and he [was] of the house ofCaleb.   

{25:4} And David heard in the wilderness that Nabal did shear hissheep. 

{25:5} And David sent out ten young men, and David said unto theyoung men, Get you up to Carmel, and go to Nabal, and greet him in myname: 

{25:6} And thus shall ye say to him that liveth [in prosperity,]Peace [be] both to thee, and peace [be] to thine house, and peace [be]unto all that thou hast. 

{25:7} And now I have heard that thou hastshearers: now thy shepherds which were with us, we hurt them not,neither was there ought missing unto them, all the while they were inCarmel. 

{25:8} Ask thy young men, and they will shew thee. Whereforelet the young men find favour in thine eyes: for we come in a good day:give, I pray thee, whatsoever cometh to thine hand unto thy servants,and to thy son David. 

{25:9} And when David's young men came, theyspake to Nabal according to all those words in the name of David, andceased.   

{25:10} And Nabal answered David's servants, and said, Who [is]David? and who [is] the son of Jesse? there be many servants now a daysthat break away every man from his master. 

{25:11} Shall I then take mybread, and my water, and my flesh that I have killed for my shearers,and give [it] unto men, whom I know not whence they [be? ]

{25:12} SoDavid's young men turned their way, and went again, and came and toldhim all those sayings. 

{25:13} And David said unto his men, Gird ye onevery man his sword. And they girded on every man his sword; and Davidalso girded on his sword: and there went up after David about fourhundred men; and two hundred abode by the stuff.   

{25:14} But one of the young men told Abigail, Nabal's wife, saying,Behold, David sent messengers out of the wilderness to salute ourmaster; and he railed on them. 

{25:15} But the men [were] very goodunto us, and we were not hurt, neither missed we any thing, as long aswe were conversant with them, when we were in the fields: 

{25:16} Theywere a wall unto us both by night and day, all the while we were withthem keeping the sheep. 

{25:17} Now therefore know and consider whatthou wilt do; for evil is determined against our master, and againstall his household: for he [is such] a son of Belial, that [a man]cannot speak to him.   

{25:18} Then Abigail made haste, and took two hundred loaves, andtwo bottles of wine, and five sheep ready dressed, and five measures ofparched [corn,] and an hundred clusters of raisins, and two hundredcakes of figs, and laid [them] on asses. 

{25:19} And she said unto herservants, Go on before me; behold, I come after you. But she told nother husband Nabal. 

{25:20} And it was [so, as] she rode on the ass,that she came down by the covert of the hill, and, behold, David andhis men came down against her; and she met them. 

{25:21} Now David hadsaid, Surely in vain have I kept all that this [fellow] hath in thewilderness, so that nothing was missed of all that [pertained] untohim: and he hath requited me evil for good. 

{25:22} So and more also doGod unto the enemies of David, if I leave of all that [pertain] to himby the morning light any that pisseth against the wall. 

{25:23} Andwhen Abigail saw David, she hasted, and lighted off the ass, and fellbefore David on her face, and bowed herself to the ground, 

{25:24} Andfell at his feet, and said, Upon me, my lord, [upon] me [let this]iniquity [be:] and let thine handmaid, I pray thee, speak in thineaudience, and hear the words of thine handmaid. 

{25:25} Let not mylord, I pray thee, regard this man of Belial, [even] Nabal: for as hisname [is,] so [is] he; Nabal [is] his name, and folly [is] with him:but I thine handmaid saw not the young men of my lord, whom thou didstsend. 

{25:26} Now therefore, my lord, [as] the LORD liveth, and [as]thy soul liveth, seeing the LORD hath withholden thee from coming to[shed] blood, and from avenging thyself with thine own hand, now letthine enemies, and they that seek evil to my lord, be as Nabal. 

{25:27}And now this blessing which thine handmaid hath brought unto my lord,let it even be given unto the young men that follow my lord. 

{25:28} Ipray thee, forgive the trespass of thine handmaid: for the LORD willcertainly make my lord a sure house; because my lord fighteth thebattles of the LORD, and evil hath not been found in thee [all] thydays. 

{25:29} Yet a man is risen to pursue thee, and to seek thy soul:but the soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of life with theLORD thy God; and the souls of thine enemies, them shall he sling out,[as out] of the middle of a sling. 

{25:30} And it shall come to pass,when the LORD shall have done to my lord according to all the good thathe hath spoken concerning thee, and shall have appointed thee rulerover Israel; 

{25:31} That this shall be no grief unto thee, nor offenceof heart unto my lord, either that thou hast shed blood causeless, orthat my lord hath avenged himself: but when the LORD shall have dealtwell with my lord, then remember thine handmaid.   

{25:32} And David said to Abigail, Blessed [be] the LORD God ofIsrael, which sent thee this day to meet me: 

{25:33} And blessed [be]thy advice, and blessed [be] thou, which hast kept me this day fromcoming to [shed] blood, and from avenging myself with mine own hand.

{25:34} For in very deed, [as] the LORD God of Israel liveth, whichhath kept me back from hurting thee, except thou hadst hasted and cometo meet me, surely there had not been left unto Nabal by the morninglight any that pisseth against the wall. 

{25:35} So David received ofher hand [that] which she had brought him, and said unto her, Go up inpeace to thine house; see, I have hearkened to thy voice, and haveaccepted thy person.   

{25:36} And Abigail came to Nabal; and, behold, he held a feast inhis house, like the feast of a king; and Nabal's heart [was] merrywithin him, for he [was] very drunken: wherefore she told him nothing,less or more, until the morning light. 

{25:37} But it came to pass inthe morning, when the wine was gone out of Nabal, and his wife had toldhim these things, that his heart died within him, and he became [as] astone. 

{25:38} And it came to pass about ten days [after,] that theLORD smote Nabal, that he died.   

{25:39} And when David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, Blessed[be] the LORD, that hath pleaded the cause of my reproach from the handof Nabal, and hath kept his servant from evil: for the LORD hathreturned the wickedness of Nabal upon his own head. And David sent andcommuned with Abigail, to take her to him to wife. 

{25:40} And when theservants of David were come to Abigail to Carmel, they spake unto her,saying, David sent us unto thee to take thee to him to wife. 

{25:41}And she arose, and bowed herself on [her] face to the earth, and said,Behold, [let] thine handmaid [be] a servant to wash the feet of theservants of my lord. 

{25:42} And Abigail hasted, and arose, and rodeupon an ass, with five damsels of hers that went after her; and shewent after the messengers of David, and became his wife. 

{25:43} Davidalso took Ahinoam of Jezreel; and they were also both of them his wives.   

{25:44} But Saul had given Michal his daughter, David's wife, toPhalti the son of Laish, which [was] of Gallim.   

{26:1} And the Ziphites came unto Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doth notDavid hide himself in the hill of Hachilah, [which is] before Jeshimon?

{26:2} Then Saul arose, and went down to the wilderness of Ziph, havingthree thousand chosen men of Israel with him, to seek David in thewilderness of Ziph. 

{26:3} And Saul pitched in the hill of Hachilah,which [is] before Jeshimon, by the way. But David abode in thewilderness, and he saw that Saul came after him into the wilderness.

{26:4} David therefore sent out spies, and understood that Saul wascome in very deed.   

{26:5} And David arose, and came to the place where Saul hadpitched: and David beheld the place where Saul lay, and Abner the sonof Ner, the captain of his host: and Saul lay in the trench, and thepeople pitched round about him. 

{26:6} Then answered David and said toAhimelech the Hittite, and to Abishai the son of Zeruiah, brother toJoab, saying, Who will go down with me to Saul to the camp? And Abishaisaid, I will go down with thee. 

{26:7} So David and Abishai came to thepeople by night: and, behold, Saul lay sleeping within the trench, andhis spear stuck in the ground at his bolster: but Abner and the peoplelay round about him. 

{26:8} Then said Abishai to David, God hathdelivered thine enemy into thine hand this day: now therefore let mesmite him, I pray thee, with the spear even to the earth at once, and Iwill not [smite] him the second time. 

{26:9} And David said to Abishai,Destroy him not: for who can stretch forth his hand against the LORD'Sanointed, and be guiltless? 

{26:10} David said furthermore, [As] theLORD liveth, the LORD shall smite him; or his day shall come to die; orhe shall descend into battle, and perish. 

{26:11} The LORD forbid thatI should stretch forth mine hand against the LORD'S anointed: but, Ipray thee, take thou now the spear that [is] at his bolster, and thecruse of water, and let us go. 

{26:12} So David took the spear and thecruse of water from Saul's bolster; and they gat them away, and no mansaw [it,] nor knew [it,] neither awaked: for they [were] all asleep;because a deep sleep from the LORD was fallen upon them.   

{26:13} Then David went over to the other side, and stood on the topof an hill afar off; a great space [being] between them: 

{26:14} AndDavid cried to the people, and to Abner the son of Ner, saying,Answerest thou not, Abner? Then Abner answered and said, Who [art] thou[that] criest to the king? 

{26:15} And David said to Abner, [Art] notthou a [valiant] man? and who [is] like to thee in Israel? whereforethen hast thou not kept thy lord the king? for there came one of thepeople in to destroy the king thy lord. 

{26:16} This thing [is] notgood that thou hast done. [As] the LORD liveth, ye [are] worthy to die,because ye have not kept your master, the LORD'S anointed. And now seewhere the king's spear is, and the cruse of water that [was] at hisbolster. 

{26:17} And Saul knew David's voice, and said, [Is] this thyvoice, my son David? And David said, [It is] my voice, my lord, O king.

{26:18} And he said, Wherefore doth my lord thus pursue after hisservant? for what have I done? or what evil [is] in mine hand? 

{26:19}Now therefore, I pray thee, let my lord the king hear the words of hisservant. If the LORD have stirred thee up against me, let him accept anoffering: but if [they be] the children of men, cursed [be] they beforethe LORD; for they have driven me out this day from abiding in theinheritance of the LORD, saying, Go, serve other gods. 

{26:20} Nowtherefore, let not my blood fall to the earth before the face of theLORD: for the king of Israel is come out to seek a flea, as when onedoth hunt a partridge in the mountains.   

{26:21} Then said Saul, I have sinned: return, my son David: for Iwill no more do thee harm, because my soul was precious in thine eyesthis day: behold, I have played the fool, and have erred exceedingly.

{26:22} And David answered and said, Behold the king's spear! and letone of the young men come over and fetch it. 

{26:23} The LORD render toevery man his righteousness and his faithfulness: for the LORDdelivered thee into [my] hand to day, but I would not stretch forthmine hand against the LORD'S anointed. 

{26:24} And, behold, as thy lifewas much set by this day in mine eyes, so let my life be much set by inthe eyes of the LORD, and let him deliver me out of all tribulation.

{26:25} Then Saul said to David, Blessed [be] thou, my son David: thoushalt both do great things, and also shalt still prevail. So David wenton his way, and Saul returned to his place.   

{27:1} And David said in his heart, I shall now perish one day bythe hand of Saul: [there is] nothing better for me than that I shouldspeedily escape into the land of the Philistines; and Saul shalldespair of me, to seek me any more in any coast of Israel: so shall Iescape out of his hand. 

{27:2} And David arose, and he passed over withthe six hundred men that [were] with him unto Achish, the son of Maoch,king of Gath. 

{27:3} And David dwelt with Achish at Gath, he and hismen, every man with his household, [even] David with his two wives,Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the Carmelitess, Nabal's wife.

{27:4} And it was told Saul that David was fled to Gath: and he soughtno more again for him.   

{27:5} And David said unto Achish, If I have now found grace inthine eyes, let them give me a place in some town in the country, thatI may dwell there: for why should thy servant dwell in the royal citywith thee? 

{27:6} Then Achish gave him Ziklag that day: whereforeZiklag pertaineth unto the kings of Judah unto this day. 

{27:7} And thetime that David dwelt in the country of the Philistines was a full yearand four months.   

{27:8} And David and his men went up, and invaded the Geshurites,and the Gezrites, and the Amalekites: for those [nations were] of oldthe inhabitants of the land, as thou goest to Shur, even unto the landof Egypt. 

{27:9} And David smote the land, and left neither man norwoman alive, and took away the sheep, and the oxen, and the asses, andthe camels, and the apparel, and returned, and came to Achish. 

{27:10}And Achish said, Whither have ye made a road to day? And David said,Against the south of Judah, and against the south of the Jerahmeelites,and against the south of the Kenites. 

{27:11} And David saved neitherman nor woman alive, to bring [tidings] to Gath, saying, Lest theyshould tell on us, saying, So did David, and so [will be] his mannerall the while he dwelleth in the country of the Philistines. 

{27:12}And Achish believed David, saying, He hath made his people Israelutterly to abhor him; therefore he shall be my servant for ever.   

{28:1} And it came to pass in those days, that the Philistinesgathered their armies together for warfare, to fight with Israel. AndAchish said unto David, Know thou assuredly, that thou shalt go outwith me to battle, thou and thy men. 

{28:2} And David said to Achish,Surely thou shalt know what thy servant can do. And Achish said toDavid, Therefore will I make thee keeper of mine head for ever.   

{28:3} Now Samuel was dead, and all Israel had lamented him, andburied him in Ramah, even in his own city. And Saul had put away thosethat had familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land. 

{28:4} Andthe Philistines gathered themselves together, and came and pitched inShunem: and Saul gathered all Israel together, and they pitched inGilboa. 

{28:5} And when Saul saw the host of the Philistines, he wasafraid, and his heart greatly trembled. 

{28:6} And when Saul enquiredof the LORD, the LORD answered him not, neither by dreams nor by Urim,nor by prophets.   

{28:7} Then said Saul unto his servants, Seek me a woman that hath afamiliar spirit, that I may go to her, and enquire of her. And hisservants said to him, Behold, [there is] a woman that hath a familiarspirit at Endor. 

{28:8} And Saul disguised himself, and put on otherraiment, and he went, and two men with him, and they came to the womanby night: and he said, I pray thee, divine unto me by the familiarspirit, and bring me [him] up, whom I shall name unto thee. 

{28:9} Andthe woman said unto him, Behold, thou knowest what Saul hath done, howhe hath cut off those that have familiar spirits, and the wizards, outof the land: wherefore then layest thou a snare for my life, to causeme to die? 

{28:10} And Saul sware to her by the LORD, saying, [As] theLORD liveth, there shall no punishment happen to thee for this thing.

{28:11} Then said the woman, Whom shall I bring up unto thee? And hesaid, Bring me up Samuel. 

{28:12} And when the woman saw Samuel, shecried with a loud voice: and the woman spake to Saul, saying, Why hastthou deceived me? for thou [art] Saul. 

{28:13} And the king said untoher, Be not afraid: for what sawest thou? And the woman said unto Saul,I saw gods ascending out of the earth. 

{28:14} And he said unto her,What form [is] he of? And she said, An old man cometh up; and he [is]covered with a mantle. And Saul perceived that it [was] Samuel, and hestooped with [his] face to the ground, and bowed himself.   

{28:15} And Samuel said to Saul, Why hast thou disquieted me, tobring me up? And Saul answered, I am sore distressed; for thePhilistines make war against me, and God is departed from me, andanswereth me no more, neither by prophets, nor by dreams: therefore Ihave called thee, that thou mayest make known unto me what I shall do.

{28:16} Then said Samuel, Wherefore then dost thou ask of me, seeingthe LORD is departed from thee, and is become thine enemy? 

{28:17} Andthe LORD hath done to him, as he spake by me: for the LORD hath rentthe kingdom out of thine hand, and given it to thy neighbour, [even] toDavid: 

{28:18} Because thou obeyedst not the voice of the LORD, norexecutedst his fierce wrath upon Amalek, therefore hath the LORD donethis thing unto thee this day. 

{28:19} Moreover the LORD will alsodeliver Israel with thee into the hand of the Philistines: and tomorrow [shalt] thou and thy sons [be] with me: the LORD also shalldeliver the host of Israel into the hand of the Philistines. 

{28:20}Then Saul fell straightway all along on the earth, and was sore afraid,because of the words of Samuel: and there was no strength in him; forhe had eaten no bread all the day, nor all the night.   

{28:21} And the woman came unto Saul, and saw that he was soretroubled, and said unto him, Behold, thine handmaid hath obeyed thyvoice, and I have put my life in my hand, and have hearkened unto thywords which thou spakest unto me. 

{28:22} Now therefore, I pray thee,hearken thou also unto the voice of thine handmaid, and let me set amorsel of bread before thee; and eat, that thou mayest have strength,when thou goest on thy way. 

{28:23} But he refused, and said, I willnot eat. But his servants, together with the woman, compelled him; andhe hearkened unto their voice. So he arose from the earth, and sat uponthe bed. 

{28:24} And the woman had a fat calf in the house; and shehasted, and killed it, and took flour, and kneaded [it,] and did bakeunleavened bread thereof: 

{28:25} And she brought [it] before Saul, andbefore his servants; and they did eat. Then they rose up, and went awaythat night.   

{29:1} Now the Philistines gathered together all their armies toAphek: and the Israelites pitched by a fountain which [is] in Jezreel.

{29:2} And the lords of the Philistines passed on by hundreds, and bythousands: but David and his men passed on in the rereward with Achish.

{29:3} Then said the princes of the Philistines, What [do] theseHebrews [here?] And Achish said unto the princes of the Philistines,[Is] not this David, the servant of Saul the king of Israel, which hathbeen with me these days, or these years, and I have found no fault inhim since he fell [unto me] unto this day? 

{29:4} And the princes ofthe Philistines were wroth with him; and the princes of the Philistinessaid unto him, Make this fellow return, that he may go again to hisplace which thou hast appointed him, and let him not go down with us tobattle, lest in the battle he be an adversary to us: for wherewithshould he reconcile himself unto his master? [should it] not [be] withthe heads of these men? 

{29:5} [Is] not this David, of whom they sangone to another in dances, saying, Saul slew his thousands, and Davidhis ten thousands?   

{29:6} Then Achish called David, and said unto him, Surely, [as] theLORD liveth, thou hast been upright, and thy going out and thy comingin with me in the host [is] good in my sight: for I have not found evilin thee since the day of thy coming unto me unto this day: neverthelessthe lords favour thee not. 

{29:7} Wherefore now return, and go inpeace, that thou displease not the lords of the Philistines.   

{29:8} And David said unto Achish, But what have I done? and whathast thou found in thy servant so long as I have been with thee untothis day, that I may not go fight against the enemies of my lord theking? 

{29:9} And Achish answered and said to David, I know that thou[art] good in my sight, as an angel of God: notwithstanding the princesof the Philistines have said, He shall not go up with us to the battle.

{29:10} Wherefore now rise up early in the morning with thy master'sservants that are come with thee: and as soon as ye be up early in themorning, and have light, depart. 

{29:11} So David and his men rose upearly to depart in the morning, to return into the land of thePhilistines. And the Philistines went up to Jezreel.   

{30:1} And it came to pass, when David and his men were come toZiklag on the third day, that the Amalekites had invaded the south, andZiklag, and smitten Ziklag, and burned it with fire; 

{30:2} And hadtaken the women captives, that [were] therein: they slew not any,either great or small, but carried [them] away, and went on their way.   

{30:3} So David and his men came to the city, and, behold, it wasburned with fire; and their wives, and their sons, and their daughters,were taken captives. 

{30:4} Then David and the people that [were] withhim lifted up their voice and wept, until they had no more power toweep. 

{30:5} And David's two wives were taken captives, Ahinoam theJezreelitess, and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite. 

{30:6} AndDavid was greatly distressed; for the people spake of stoning him,because the soul of all the people was grieved, every man for his sonsand for his daughters: but David encouraged himself in the LORD hisGod. 

{30:7} And David said to Abiathar the priest, Ahimelech's son, Ipray thee, bring me hither the ephod. And Abiathar brought thither theephod to David. 

{30:8} And David enquired at the LORD, saying, Shall Ipursue after this troop? shall I overtake them? And he answered him,Pursue: for thou shalt surely overtake [them,] and without fail recover[all. ]

{30:9} So David went, he and the six hundred men that [were]with him, and came to the brook Besor, where those that were leftbehind stayed. 

{30:10} But David pursued, he and four hundred men: fortwo hundred abode behind, which were so faint that they could not goover the brook Besor.   

{30:11} And they found an Egyptian in the field, and brought him toDavid, and gave him bread, and he did eat; and they made him drinkwater; 

{30:12} And they gave him a piece of a cake of figs, and twoclusters of raisins: and when he had eaten, his spirit came again tohim: for he had eaten no bread, nor drunk [any] water, three days andthree nights. 

{30:13} And David said unto him, To whom [belongest]thou? and whence art thou? And he said, I [am] a young man of Egypt,servant to an Amalekite; and my master left me, because three daysagone I fell sick. 

{30:14} We made an invasion [upon] the south of theCherethites, and upon [the coast] which [belongeth] to Judah, and uponthe south of Caleb; and we burned Ziklag with fire. 

{30:15} And Davidsaid to him, Canst thou bring me down to this company? And he said,Swear unto me by God, that thou wilt neither kill me, nor deliver meinto the hands of my master, and I will bring thee down to this company.   

{30:16} And when he had brought him down, behold, [they were] spreadabroad upon all the earth, eating and drinking, and dancing, because ofall the great spoil that they had taken out of the land of thePhilistines, and out of the land of Judah. 

{30:17} And David smote themfrom the twilight even unto the evening of the next day: and thereescaped not a man of them, save four hundred young men, which rode uponcamels, and fled. 

{30:18} And David recovered all that the Amalekiteshad carried away: and David rescued his two wives. 

{30:19} And therewas nothing lacking to them, neither small nor great, neither sons nordaughters, neither spoil, nor any [thing] that they had taken to them:David recovered all. 

{30:20} And David took all the flocks and theherds, [which] they drave before those [other] cattle, and said, This[is] David's spoil.   

{30:21} And David came to the two hundred men, which were so faintthat they could not follow David, whom they had made also to abide atthe brook Besor: and they went forth to meet David, and to meet thepeople that [were] with him: and when David came near to the people, hesaluted them. 

{30:22} Then answered all the wicked men and [men] ofBelial, of those that went with David, and said, Because they went notwith us, we will not give them [ought] of the spoil that we haverecovered, save to every man his wife and his children, that they maylead [them] away, and depart. 

{30:23} Then said David, Ye shall not doso, my brethren, with that which the LORD hath given us, who hathpreserved us, and delivered the company that came against us into ourhand. 

{30:24} For who will hearken unto you in this matter? but as hispart [is] that goeth down to the battle, so [shall] his part [be] thattarrieth by the stuff: they shall part alike. 

{30:25} And it was [so]from that day forward, that he made it a statute and an ordinance forIsrael unto this day.   

{30:26} And when David came to Ziklag, he sent of the spoil unto theelders of Judah, [even] to his friends, saying, Behold a present foryou of the spoil of the enemies of the LORD; 

{30:27} To [them] which[were] in Bethel, and to [them] which [were] in south Ramoth, and to[them] which [were] in Jattir, 

{30:28} And to [them] which [were] inAroer, and to [them] which [were] in Siphmoth, and to [them] which[were] in Eshtemoa, 

{30:29} And to [them] which [were] in Rachal, andto [them] which [were] in the cities of the Jerahmeelites, and to[them] which [were] in the cities of the Kenites, 

{30:30} And to [them]which [were] in Hormah, and to [them] which [were] in Chor-ashan, andto [them] which [were] in Athach, 

{30:31} And to [them] which [were] inHebron, and to all the places where David himself and his men were wontto haunt.   

{31:1} Now the Philistines fought against Israel: and the men ofIsrael fled from before the Philistines, and fell down slain in mountGilboa. 

{31:2} And the Philistines followed hard upon Saul and upon hissons; and the Philistines slew Jonathan, and Abinadab, and Melchi-shua,Saul's sons. 

{31:3} And the battle went sore against Saul, and thearchers hit him; and he was sore wounded of the archers. 

{31:4} Thensaid Saul unto his armourbearer, Draw thy sword, and thrust me throughtherewith; lest these uncircumcised come and thrust me through, andabuse me. But his armourbearer would not; for he was sore afraid.Therefore Saul took a sword, and fell upon it. 

{31:5} And when hisarmourbearer saw that Saul was dead, he fell likewise upon his sword,and died with him. 

{31:6} So Saul died, and his three sons, and hisarmourbearer, and all his men, that same day together.   

{31:7} And when the men of Israel that [were] on the other side ofthe valley, and [they] that [were] on the other side Jordan, saw thatthe men of Israel fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead, theyforsook the cities, and fled; and the Philistines came and dwelt inthem. 

{31:8} And it came to pass on the morrow, when the Philistinescame to strip the slain, that they found Saul and his three sons fallenin mount Gilboa. 

{31:9} And they cut off his head, and stripped off hisarmour, and sent into the land of the Philistines round about, topublish [it in] the house of their idols, and among the people. 

{31:10}And they put his armour in the house of Ashtaroth: and they fastenedhis body to the wall of Beth-shan.   

{31:11} And when the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead heard of thatwhich the Philistines had done to Saul; 

{31:12} All the valiant menarose, and went all night, and took the body of Saul and the bodies ofhis sons from the wall of Beth-shan, and came to Jabesh, and burnt themthere. 

{31:13} And they took their bones, and buried [them] under atree at Jabesh, and fasted seven days.
