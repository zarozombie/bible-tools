{Ecclesiastesor, the Preacher   

{1:1} The words of the Preacher, the son of David, king inJerusalem. 

{1:2} Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher, vanity ofvanities; all [is] vanity. 

{1:3} What profit hath a man of all hislabour which he taketh under the sun? 

{1:4} [One] generation passethaway, and [another] generation cometh: but the earth abideth for ever.

{1:5} The sun also ariseth, and the sun goeth down, and hasteth to hisplace where he arose. 

{1:6} The wind goeth toward the south, andturneth about unto the north; it whirleth about continually, and thewind returneth again according to his circuits. 

{1:7} All the riversrun into the sea; yet the sea [is] not full; unto the place from whencethe rivers come, thither they return again. 

{1:8} All things [are] fullof labour; man cannot utter [it:] the eye is not satisfied with seeing,nor the ear filled with hearing. 

{1:9} The thing that hath been, it [isthat] which shall be; and that which is done [is] that which shall bedone: and [there is] no new [thing] under the sun. 

{1:10} Is there[any] thing whereof it may be said, See, this [is] new? it hath beenalready of old time, which was before us. 

{1:11} [There is] noremembrance of former [things;] neither shall there be [any]remembrance of [things] that are to come with [those] that shall comeafter.   

{1:12} I the Preacher was king over Israel in Jerusalem. 

{1:13} AndI gave my heart to seek and search out by wisdom concerning all[things] that are done under heaven: this sore travail hath God givento the sons of man to be exercised therewith. 

{1:14} I have seen allthe works that are done under the sun; and, behold, all [is] vanity andvexation of spirit. 

{1:15} [That which is] crooked cannot be madestraight: and that which is wanting cannot be numbered. 

{1:16} Icommuned with mine own heart, saying, Lo, I am come to great estate,and have gotten more wisdom than all [they] that have been before me inJerusalem: yea, my heart had great experience of wisdom and knowledge.

{1:17} And I gave my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness andfolly: I perceived that this also is vexation of spirit. 

{1:18} For inmuch wisdom [is] much grief: and he that increaseth knowledgeincreaseth sorrow.   

{2:1} I said in mine heart, Go to now, I will prove thee with mirth,therefore enjoy pleasure: and, behold, this also [is] vanity. 

{2:2} Isaid of laughter, [It is] mad: and of mirth, What doeth it? 

{2:3} Isought in mine heart to give myself unto wine, yet acquainting mineheart with wisdom; and to lay hold on folly, till I might see what[was] that good for the sons of men, which they should do under theheaven all the days of their life. 

{2:4} I made me great works; Ibuilded me houses; I planted me vineyards: 

{2:5} I made me gardens andorchards, and I planted trees in them of all [kind of] fruits: 

{2:6} Imade me pools of water, to water therewith the wood that bringeth forthtrees: 

{2:7} I got [me] servants and maidens, and had servants born inmy house; also I had great possessions of great and small cattle aboveall that were in Jerusalem before me: 

{2:8} I gathered me also silverand gold, and the peculiar treasure of kings and of the provinces: Igat me men singers and women singers, and the delights of the sons ofmen, [as] musical instruments, and that of all sorts. 

{2:9} So I wasgreat, and increased more than all that were before me in Jerusalem:also my wisdom remained with me. 

{2:10} And whatsoever mine eyesdesired I kept not from them, I withheld not my heart from any joy; formy heart rejoiced in all my labour: and this was my portion of all mylabour. 

{2:11} Then I looked on all the works that my hands hadwrought, and on the labour that I had laboured to do: and, behold, all[was] vanity and vexation of spirit, and [there was] no profit underthe sun. 

{2:12} And I turned myself to behold wisdom, and madness, andfolly: for what [can] the man [do] that cometh after the king? [even]that which hath been already done. 

{2:13} Then I saw that wisdomexcelleth folly, as far as light excelleth darkness. 

{2:14} The wiseman's eyes [are] in his head; but the fool walketh in darkness: and Imyself perceived also that one event happeneth to them all. 

{2:15} Thensaid I in my heart, As it happeneth to the fool, so it happeneth evento me; and why was I then more wise? Then I said in my heart, that thisalso [is] vanity. 

{2:16} For [there is] no remembrance of the wise morethan of the fool for ever; seeing that which now [is] in the days tocome shall all be forgotten. And how dieth the wise [man?] as the fool.

{2:17} Therefore I hated life; because the work that is wrought underthe sun is grievous unto me: for all [is] vanity and vexation of spirit.   

{2:18} Yea, I hated all my labour which I had taken under the sun:because I should leave it unto the man that shall be after me. 

{2:19}And who knoweth whether he shall be a wise [man] or a fool? yet shallhe have rule over all my labour wherein I have laboured, and wherein Ihave shewed myself wise under the sun. This [is] also vanity. 

{2:20}Therefore I went about to cause my heart to despair of all the labourwhich I took under the sun. 

{2:21} For there is a man whose labour [is]in wisdom, and in knowledge, and in equity; yet to a man that hath notlaboured therein shall he leave it [for] his portion. This also [is]vanity and a great evil. 

{2:22} For what hath man of all his labour,and of the vexation of his heart, wherein he hath laboured under thesun? 

{2:23} For all his days [are] sorrows, and his travail grief; yea,his heart taketh not rest in the night. This is also vanity.   

{2:24} [There is] nothing better for a man, [than] that he shouldeat and drink, and [that] he should make his soul enjoy good in hislabour. This also I saw, that it [was] from the hand of God. 

{2:25} Forwho can eat, or who else can hasten [hereunto,] more than I? 

{2:26} For[God] giveth to a man that [is] good in his sight wisdom, andknowledge, and joy: but to the sinner he giveth travail, to gather andto heap up, that he may give to [him that is] good before God. Thisalso [is] vanity and vexation of spirit.   

{3:1} To every [thing there is] a season, and a time to everypurpose under the heaven: 

{3:2} A time to be born, and a time to die; atime to plant, and a time to pluck up [that which is] planted; 

{3:3} Atime to kill, and a time to heal; a time to break down, and a time tobuild up; 

{3:4} A time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn,and a time to dance; 

{3:5} A time to cast away stones, and a time togather stones together; a time to embrace, and a time to refrain fromembracing; 

{3:6} A time to get, and a time to lose; a time to keep, anda time to cast away; 

{3:7} A time to rend, and a time to sew; a time tokeep silence, and a time to speak; 

{3:8} A time to love, and a time tohate; a time of war, and a time of peace. 

{3:9} What profit hath hethat worketh in that wherein he laboureth? 

{3:10} I have seen thetravail, which God hath given to the sons of men to be exercised in it.

{3:11} He hath made every [thing] beautiful in his time: also he hathset the world in their heart, so that no man can find out the work thatGod maketh from the beginning to the end. 

{3:12} I know that [there is]no good in them, but for [a man] to rejoice, and to do good in hislife. 

{3:13} And also that every man should eat and drink, and enjoythe good of all his labour, it [is] the gift of God. 

{3:14} I knowthat, whatsoever God doeth, it shall be for ever: nothing can be put toit, nor any thing taken from it: and God doeth [it,] that [men] shouldfear before him. 

{3:15} That which hath been is now; and that which isto be hath already been; and God requireth that which is past.   

{3:16} And moreover I saw under the sun the place of judgment,[that] wickedness [was] there; and the place of righteousness, [that]iniquity [was] there. 

{3:17} I said in mine heart, God shall judge therighteous and the wicked: for [there is] a time there for every purposeand for every work. 

{3:18} I said in mine heart concerning the estateof the sons of men, that God might manifest them, and that they mightsee that they themselves are beasts. 

{3:19} For that which befalleththe sons of men befalleth beasts; even one thing befalleth them: as theone dieth, so dieth the other; yea, they have all one breath; so that aman hath no preeminence above a beast: for all [is] vanity. 

{3:20} Allgo unto one place; all are of the dust, and all turn to dust again.

{3:21} Who knoweth the spirit of man that goeth upward, and the spiritof the beast that goeth downward to the earth? 

{3:22} Wherefore Iperceive that [there is] nothing better, than that a man should rejoicein his own works; for that [is] his portion: for who shall bring him tosee what shall be after him?   

{4:1} So I returned, and considered all the oppressions that aredone under the sun: and behold the tears of [such as were] oppressed,and they had no comforter; and on the side of their oppressors [therewas] power; but they had no comforter. 

{4:2} Wherefore I praised thedead which are already dead more than the living which are yet alive.

{4:3} Yea, better [is he] than both they, which hath not yet been, whohath not seen the evil work that is done under the sun.   

{4:4} Again, I considered all travail, and every right work, thatfor this a man is envied of his neighbour. This [is] also vanity andvexation of spirit. 

{4:5} The fool foldeth his hands together, andeateth his own flesh. 

{4:6} Better [is] an handful [with] quietness,than both the hands full [with] travail and vexation of spirit.   

{4:7} Then I returned, and I saw vanity under the sun. 

{4:8} Thereis one [alone,] and [there is] not a second; yea, he hath neither childnor brother: yet [is there] no end of all his labour; neither is hiseye satisfied with riches; neither [saith he,] For whom do I labour,and bereave my soul of good? This [is] also vanity, yea, it [is] a soretravail.   

{4:9} Two [are] better than one; because they have a good reward fortheir labour. 

{4:10} For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow:but woe to him [that is] alone when he falleth; for [he hath] notanother to help him up. 

{4:11} Again, if two lie together, then theyhave heat: but how can one be warm [alone? ]

{4:12} And if one prevailagainst him, two shall withstand him; and a threefold cord is notquickly broken.   

{4:13} Better [is] a poor and a wise child than an old and foolishking, who will no more be admonished. 

{4:14} For out of prison hecometh to reign; whereas also [he that is] born in his kingdom becomethpoor. 

{4:15} I considered all the living which walk under the sun, withthe second child that shall stand up in his stead. 

{4:16} [There is] noend of all the people, [even] of all that have been before them: theyalso that come after shall not rejoice in him. Surely this also [is]vanity and vexation of spirit.   

{5:1} Keep thy foot when thou goest to the house of God, and be moreready to hear, than to give the sacrifice of fools: for they considernot that they do evil. 

{5:2} Be not rash with thy mouth, and let notthine heart be hasty to utter [any] thing before God: for God [is] inheaven, and thou upon earth: therefore let thy words be few. 

{5:3} Fora dream cometh through the multitude of business; and a fool's voice[is known] by multitude of words. 

{5:4} When thou vowest a vow untoGod, defer not to pay it; for [he hath] no pleasure in fools: pay thatwhich thou hast vowed. 

{5:5} Better [is it] that thou shouldest notvow, than that thou shouldest vow and not pay. 

{5:6} Suffer not thymouth to cause thy flesh to sin; neither say thou before the angel,that it [was] an error: wherefore should God be angry at thy voice, anddestroy the work of thine hands? 

{5:7} For in the multitude of dreamsand many words [there are] also [divers] vanities: but fear thou God.   

{5:8} If thou seest the oppression of the poor, and violentperverting of judgment and justice in a province, marvel not at thematter: for [he that is] higher than the highest regardeth; and [therebe] higher than they.   

{5:9} Moreover the profit of the earth is for all: the king[himself] is served by the field. 

{5:10} He that loveth silver shallnot be satisfied with silver; nor he that loveth abundance withincrease: this [is] also vanity. 

{5:11} When goods increase, they areincreased that eat them: and what good [is there] to the ownersthereof, saving the beholding [of them] with their eyes? 

{5:12} Thesleep of a labouring man [is] sweet, whether he eat little or much: butthe abundance of the rich will not suffer him to sleep. 

{5:13} There isa sore evil [which] I have seen under the sun, [namely,] riches keptfor the owners thereof to their hurt. 

{5:14} But those riches perish byevil travail: and he begetteth a son, and [there is] nothing in hishand. 

{5:15} As he came forth of his mother's womb, naked shall hereturn to go as he came, and shall take nothing of his labour, which hemay carry away in his hand. 

{5:16} And this also [is] a sore evil,[that] in all points as he came, so shall he go: and what profit hathhe that hath laboured for the wind? 

{5:17} All his days also he eatethin darkness, and [he hath] much sorrow and wrath with his sickness.   

{5:18} Behold [that] which I have seen: [it is] good and comely [forone] to eat and to drink, and to enjoy the good of all his labour thathe taketh under the sun all the days of his life, which God giveth him:for it [is] his portion. 

{5:19} Every man also to whom God hath givenriches and wealth, and hath given him power to eat thereof, and to takehis portion, and to rejoice in his labour; this [is] the gift of God.

{5:20} For he shall not much remember the days of his life; because Godanswereth [him] in the joy of his heart.   

{6:1} There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, and it [is]common among men: 

{6:2} A man to whom God hath given riches, wealth,and honour, so that he wanteth nothing for his soul of all that hedesireth, yet God giveth him not power to eat thereof, but a strangereateth it: this [is] vanity, and it [is] an evil disease.   

{6:3} If a man beget an hundred [children,] and live many years, sothat the days of his years be many, and his soul be not filled withgood, and also [that] he have no burial; I say, [that] an untimelybirth [is] better than he. 

{6:4} For he cometh in with vanity, anddeparteth in darkness, and his name shall be covered with darkness.

{6:5} Moreover he hath not seen the sun, nor known [any thing:] thishath more rest than the other.   

{6:6} Yea, though he live a thousand years twice [told,] yet hath heseen no good: do not all go to one place? 

{6:7} All the labour of man[is] for his mouth, and yet the appetite is not filled. 

{6:8} For whathath the wise more than the fool? what hath the poor, that knoweth towalk before the living?   

{6:9} Better [is] the sight of the eyes than the wandering of thedesire: this [is] also vanity and vexation of spirit. 

{6:10} That whichhath been is named already, and it is known that it [is] man: neithermay he contend with him that is mightier than he.   

{6:11} Seeing there be many things that increase vanity, what [is]man the better? 

{6:12} For who knoweth what [is] good for man in [this]life, all the days of his vain life which he spendeth as a shadow? forwho can tell a man what shall be after him under the sun?   

{7:1} A good name [is] better than precious ointment; and the day ofdeath than the day of one's birth.   

{7:2} [It is] better to go to the house of mourning, than to go tothe house of feasting: for that is the end of all men; and the livingwill lay [it] to his heart. 

{7:3} Sorrow [is] better than laughter: forby the sadness of the countenance the heart is made better. 

{7:4} Theheart of the wise [is] in the house of mourning; but the heart of fools[is] in the house of mirth. 

{7:5} [It is] better to hear the rebuke ofthe wise, than for a man to hear the song of fools. 

{7:6} For as thecrackling of thorns under a pot, so [is] the laughter of the fool: thisalso [is] vanity.   

{7:7} Surely oppression maketh a wise man mad; and a gift destroyeththe heart. 

{7:8} Better [is] the end of a thing than the beginningthereof: [and] the patient in spirit [is] better than the proud inspirit. 

{7:9} Be not hasty in thy spirit to be angry: for anger restethin the bosom of fools. 

{7:10} Say not thou, What is [the cause] thatthe former days were better than these? for thou dost not enquirewisely concerning this.   

{7:11} Wisdom [is] good with an inheritance: and [by it there is]profit to them that see the sun. 

{7:12} For wisdom [is] a defence,[and] money [is] a defence: but the excellency of knowledge [is, that]wisdom giveth life to them that have it. 

{7:13} Consider the work ofGod: for who can make [that] straight, which he hath made crooked?

{7:14} In the day of prosperity be joyful, but in the day of adversityconsider: God also hath set the one over against the other, to the endthat man should find nothing after him. 

{7:15} All [things] have I seenin the days of my vanity: there is a just [man] that perisheth in hisrighteousness, and there is a wicked [man] that prolongeth [his life]in his wickedness. 

{7:16} Be not righteous over much; neither makethyself over wise: why shouldest thou destroy thyself? 

{7:17} Be notover much wicked, neither be thou foolish: why shouldest thou diebefore thy time? 

{7:18} [It is] good that thou shouldest take hold ofthis; yea, also from this withdraw not thine hand: for he that fearethGod shall come forth of them all. 

{7:19} Wisdom strengtheneth the wisemore than ten mighty [men] which are in the city. 

{7:20} For [there is]not a just man upon earth, that doeth good, and sinneth not. 

{7:21}Also take no heed unto all words that are spoken; lest thou hear thyservant curse thee: 

{7:22} For oftentimes also thine own heart knoweththat thou thyself likewise hast cursed others.   

{7:23} All this have I proved by wisdom: I said, I will be wise; butit [was] far from me. 

{7:24} That which is far off, and exceeding deep,who can find it out? 

{7:25} I applied mine heart to know, and tosearch, and to seek out wisdom, and the reason [of things,] and to knowthe wickedness of folly, even of foolishness [and] madness: 

{7:26} AndI find more bitter than death the woman, whose heart [is] snares andnets, [and] her hands [as] bands: whoso pleaseth God shall escape fromher; but the sinner shall be taken by her. 

{7:27} Behold, this have Ifound, saith the preacher, [counting] one by one, to find out theaccount: 

{7:28} Which yet my soul seeketh, but I find not: one manamong a thousand have I found; but a woman among all those have I notfound. 

{7:29} Lo, this only have I found, that God hath made manupright; but they have sought out many inventions.   

{8:1} Who [is] as the wise [man?] and who knoweth the interpretationof a thing? a man's wisdom maketh his face to shine, and the boldnessof his face shall be changed. 

{8:2} I [counsel thee] to keep the king'scommandment, and [that] in regard of the oath of God. 

{8:3} Be nothasty to go out of his sight: stand not in an evil thing; for he doethwhatsoever pleaseth him. 

{8:4} Where the word of a king [is, there is]power: and who may say unto him, What doest thou? 

{8:5} Whoso keepeththe commandment shall feel no evil thing: and a wise man's heartdiscerneth both time and judgment.   

{8:6} Because to every purpose there is time and judgment, thereforethe misery of man [is] great upon him. 

{8:7} For he knoweth not thatwhich shall be: for who can tell him when it shall be? 

{8:8} [There is]no man that hath power over the spirit to retain the spirit; neither[hath he] power in the day of death: and [there is] no discharge in[that] war; neither shall wickedness deliver those that are given toit. 

{8:9} All this have I seen, and applied my heart unto every workthat is done under the sun: [there is] a time wherein one man rulethover another to his own hurt. 

{8:10} And so I saw the wicked buried,who had come and gone from the place of the holy, and they wereforgotten in the city where they had so done: this [is] also vanity.

{8:11} Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily,therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil.   

{8:12} Though a sinner do evil an hundred times, and his [days] beprolonged, yet surely I know that it shall be well with them that fearGod, which fear before him: 

{8:13} But it shall not be well with thewicked, neither shall he prolong [his] days, [which are] as a shadow;because he feareth not before God. 

{8:14} There is a vanity which isdone upon the earth; that there be just [men,] unto whom it happenethaccording to the work of the wicked; again, there be wicked [men,] towhom it happeneth according to the work of the righteous: I said thatthis also [is] vanity. 

{8:15} Then I commended mirth, because a manhath no better thing under the sun, than to eat, and to drink, and tobe merry: for that shall abide with him of his labour the days of hislife, which God giveth him under the sun.   

{8:16} When I applied mine heart to know wisdom, and to see thebusiness that is done upon the earth: (for also [there is that] neitherday nor night seeth sleep with his eyes:) 

{8:17} Then I beheld all thework of God, that a man cannot find out the work that is done under thesun: because though a man labour to seek [it] out, yet he shall notfind [it;] yea further; though a wise [man] think to know [it,] yetshall he not be able to find [it.]   

{9:1} For all this I considered in my heart even to declare allthis, that the righteous, and the wise, and their works, are in thehand of God: no man knoweth either love or hatred [by] all [that is]before them. 

{9:2} All [things come] alike to all: [there is] one eventto the righteous, and to the wicked; to the good and to the clean, andto the unclean; to him that sacrificeth, and to him that sacrificethnot: as [is] the good, so [is] the sinner; [and] he that sweareth, as[he] that feareth an oath. 

{9:3} This [is] an evil among all [things]that are done under the sun, that [there is] one event unto all: yea,also the heart of the sons of men is full of evil, and madness is intheir heart while they live, and after that [they go] to the dead.   

{9:4} For to him that is joined to all the living there is hope: fora living dog is better than a dead lion. 

{9:5} For the living know thatthey shall die: but the dead know not any thing, neither have they anymore a reward; for the memory of them is forgotten. 

{9:6} Also theirlove, and their hatred, and their envy, is now perished; neither havethey any more a portion for ever in any [thing] that is done under thesun.   

{9:7} Go thy way, eat thy bread with joy, and drink thy wine with amerry heart; for God now accepteth thy works. 

{9:8} Let thy garments bealways white; and let thy head lack no ointment. 

{9:9} Live joyfullywith the wife whom thou lovest all the days of the life of thy vanity,which he hath given thee under the sun, all the days of thy vanity: forthat [is] thy portion in [this] life, and in thy labour which thoutakest under the sun. 

{9:10} Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do [it]with thy might; for [there is] no work, nor device, nor knowledge, norwisdom, in the grave, whither thou goest.   

{9:11} I returned, and saw under the sun, that the race [is] not tothe swift, nor the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the wise,nor yet riches to men of understanding, nor yet favour to men of skill;but time and chance happeneth to them all. 

{9:12} For man also knowethnot his time: as the fishes that are taken in an evil net, and as thebirds that are caught in the snare; so [are] the sons of men snared inan evil time, when it falleth suddenly upon them.   

{9:13} This wisdom have I seen also under the sun, and it [seemed]great unto me: 

{9:14} [There was] a little city, and few men within it;and there came a great king against it, and besieged it, and builtgreat bulwarks against it: 

{9:15} Now there was found in it a poor wiseman, and he by his wisdom delivered the city; yet no man rememberedthat same poor man. 

{9:16} Then said I, Wisdom [is] better thanstrength: nevertheless the poor man's wisdom [is] despised, and hiswords are not heard. 

{9:17} The words of wise [men are] heard in quietmore than the cry of him that ruleth among fools. 

{9:18} Wisdom [is]better than weapons of war: but one sinner destroyeth much good.   

{10:1} Dead flies cause the ointment of the apothecary to send fortha stinking savour: [so doth] a little folly him that is in reputationfor wisdom [and] honour. 

{10:2} A wise man's heart [is] at his righthand; but a fool's heart at his left. 

{10:3} Yea also, when he that isa fool walketh by the way, his wisdom faileth [him,] and he saith toevery one [that] he [is] a fool. 

{10:4} If the spirit of the ruler riseup against thee, leave not thy place; for yielding pacifieth greatoffences. 

{10:5} There is an evil [which] I have seen under the sun, asan error [which] proceedeth from the ruler: 

{10:6} Folly is set ingreat dignity, and the rich sit in low place. 

{10:7} I have seenservants upon horses, and princes walking as servants upon the earth.

{10:8} He that diggeth a pit shall fall into it; and whoso breaketh anhedge, a serpent shall bite him. 

{10:9} Whoso removeth stones shall behurt therewith; [and] he that cleaveth wood shall be endangeredthereby. 

{10:10} If the iron be blunt, and he do not whet the edge,then must he put to more strength: but wisdom [is] profitable todirect. 

{10:11} Surely the serpent will bite without enchantment; and ababbler is no better. 

{10:12} The words of a wise man's mouth [are]gracious; but the lips of a fool will swallow up himself. 

{10:13} Thebeginning of the words of his mouth [is] foolishness: and the end ofhis talk [is] mischievous madness. 

{10:14} A fool also is full ofwords: a man cannot tell what shall be; and what shall be after him,who can tell him? 

{10:15} The labour of the foolish wearieth every oneof them, because he knoweth not how to go to the city.   

{10:16} Woe to thee, O land, when thy king [is] a child, and thyprinces eat in the morning! 

{10:17} Blessed [art] thou, O land, whenthy king [is] the son of nobles, and thy princes eat in due season, forstrength, and not for drunkenness!   

{10:18} By much slothfulness the building decayeth; and throughidleness of the hands the house droppeth through.   

{10:19} A feast is made for laughter, and wine maketh merry: butmoney answereth all [things.]   

{10:20} Curse not the king, no not in thy thought; and curse not therich in thy bedchamber: for a bird of the air shall carry the voice,and that which hath wings shall tell the matter.   

{11:1} Cast thy bread upon the waters: for thou shalt find it aftermany days. 

{11:2} Give a portion to seven, and also to eight; for thouknowest not what evil shall be upon the earth. 

{11:3} If the clouds befull of rain, they empty [themselves] upon the earth: and if the treefall toward the south, or toward the north, in the place where the treefalleth, there it shall be. 

{11:4} He that observeth the wind shall notsow; and he that regardeth the clouds shall not reap. 

{11:5} As thouknowest not what [is] the way of the spirit, [nor] how the bones [dogrow] in the womb of her that is with child: even so thou knowest notthe works of God who maketh all. 

{11:6} In the morning sow thy seed,and in the evening withhold not thine hand: for thou knowest notwhether shall prosper, either this or that, or whether they both [shallbe] alike good.   

{11:7} Truly the light [is] sweet, and a pleasant [thing it is] forthe eyes to behold the sun: 

{11:8} But if a man live many years, [and]rejoice in them all; yet let him remember the days of darkness; forthey shall be many. All that cometh [is] vanity.   

{11:9} Rejoice, O young man, in thy youth; and let thy heart cheerthee in the days of thy youth, and walk in the ways of thine heart, andin the sight of thine eyes: but know thou, that for all these [things]God will bring thee into judgment. 

{11:10} Therefore remove sorrow fromthy heart, and put away evil from thy flesh: for childhood and youth[are] vanity.   

{12:1} Remember now thy Creator in the days of thy youth, while theevil days come not, nor the years draw nigh, when thou shalt say, Ihave no pleasure in them; 

{12:2} While the sun, or the light, or themoon, or the stars, be not darkened, nor the clouds return after therain: 

{12:3} In the day when the keepers of the house shall tremble,and the strong men shall bow themselves, and the grinders cease becausethey are few, and those that look out of the windows be darkened,

{12:4} And the doors shall be shut in the streets, when the sound ofthe grinding is low, and he shall rise up at the voice of the bird, andall the daughters of musick shall be brought low; 

{12:5} Also [when]they shall be afraid of [that which is] high, and fears [shall be] inthe way, and the almond tree shall flourish, and the grasshopper shallbe a burden, and desire shall fail: because man goeth to his long home,and the mourners go about the streets: 

{12:6} Or ever the silver cordbe loosed, or the golden bowl be broken, or the pitcher be broken atthe fountain, or the wheel broken at the cistern. 

{12:7} Then shall thedust return to the earth as it was: and the spirit shall return untoGod who gave it.   

{12:8} Vanity of vanities, saith the preacher; all [is] vanity.

{12:9} And moreover, because the preacher was wise, he still taught thepeople knowledge; yea, he gave good heed, and sought out, [and] set inorder many proverbs. 

{12:10} The preacher sought to find out acceptablewords: and [that which was] written [was] upright, [even] words oftruth. 

{12:11} The words of the wise [are] as goads, and as nailsfastened by the masters of assemblies, [which] are given from oneshepherd. 

{12:12} And further, by these, my son, be admonished: ofmaking many books [there is] no end; and much study [is] a weariness ofthe flesh.   

{12:13} Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God,and keep his commandments: for this [is] the whole [duty] of man.

{12:14} For God shall bring every work into judgment, with every secretthing, whether [it be] good, or whether [it be] evil.
