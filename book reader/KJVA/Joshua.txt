{The Book of Joshua   

{1:1} Now after the death of Moses the servant of the LORD it cameto pass, that the LORD spake unto Joshua the son of Nun, Moses'minister, saying, 

{1:2} Moses my servant is dead; now therefore arise,go over this Jordan, thou, and all this people, unto the land which Ido give to them, [even] to the children of Israel. 

{1:3} Every placethat the sole of your foot shall tread upon, that have I given untoyou, as I said unto Moses. 

{1:4} From the wilderness and this Lebanoneven unto the great river, the river Euphrates, all the land of theHittites, and unto the great sea toward the going down of the sun,shall be your coast. 

{1:5} There shall not any man be able to standbefore thee all the days of thy life: as I was with Moses, [so] I willbe with thee: I will not fail thee, nor forsake thee. 

{1:6} Be strongand of a good courage: for unto this people shalt thou divide for aninheritance the land, which I sware unto their fathers to give them.

{1:7} Only be thou strong and very courageous, that thou mayest observeto do according to all the law, which Moses my servant commanded thee:turn not from it [to] the right hand or [to] the left, that thou mayestprosper whithersoever thou goest. 

{1:8} This book of the law shall notdepart out of thy mouth; but thou shalt meditate therein day and night,that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is writtentherein: for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous, and then thoushalt have good success. 

{1:9} Have not I commanded thee? Be strong andof a good courage; be not afraid, neither be thou dismayed: for theLORD thy God [is] with thee whithersoever thou goest.   

{1:10} Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people, saying,

{1:11} Pass through the host, and command the people, saying, Prepareyou victuals; for within three days ye shall pass over this Jordan, togo in to possess the land, which the LORD your God giveth you topossess it.   

{1:12} And to the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to half thetribe of Manasseh, spake Joshua, saying, 

{1:13} Remember the word whichMoses the servant of the LORD commanded you, saying, The LORD your Godhath given you rest, and hath given you this land. 

{1:14} Your wives,your little ones, and your cattle, shall remain in the land which Mosesgave you on this side Jordan; but ye shall pass before your brethrenarmed, all the mighty men of valour, and help them; 

{1:15} Until theLORD have given your brethren rest, as [he hath given] you, and theyalso have possessed the land which the LORD your God giveth them: thenye shall return unto the land of your possession, and enjoy it, whichMoses the LORD'S servant gave you on this side Jordan toward thesunrising.   

{1:16} And they answered Joshua, saying, All that thou commandest uswe will do, and whithersoever thou sendest us, we will go. 

{1:17}According as we hearkened unto Moses in all things, so will we hearkenunto thee: only the LORD thy God be with thee, as he was with Moses.

{1:18} Whosoever [he be] that doth rebel against thy commandment, andwill not hearken unto thy words in all that thou commandest him, heshall be put to death: only be strong and of a good courage.   

{2:1} And Joshua the son of Nun sent out of Shittim two men to spysecretly, saying, Go view the land, even Jericho. And they went, andcame into an harlot's house, named Rahab, and lodged there. 

{2:2} Andit was told the king of Jericho, saying, Behold, there came men inhither to night of the children of Israel to search out the country.

{2:3} And the king of Jericho sent unto Rahab, saying, Bring forth themen that are come to thee, which are entered into thine house: for theybe come to search out all the country. 

{2:4} And the woman took the twomen, and hid them, and said thus, There came men unto me, but I wistnot whence they [were: ]

{2:5} And it came to pass [about the time] ofshutting of the gate, when it was dark, that the men went out: whitherthe men went I wot not: pursue after them quickly; for ye shallovertake them. 

{2:6} But she had brought them up to the roof of thehouse, and hid them with the stalks of flax, which she had laid inorder upon the roof. 

{2:7} And the men pursued after them the way toJordan unto the fords: and as soon as they which pursued after themwere gone out, they shut the gate.   

{2:8} And before they were laid down, she came up unto them upon theroof; 

{2:9} And she said unto the men, I know that the LORD hath givenyou the land, and that your terror is fallen upon us, and that all theinhabitants of the land faint because of you. 

{2:10} For we have heardhow the LORD dried up the water of the Red sea for you, when ye cameout of Egypt; and what ye did unto the two kings of the Amorites, that[were] on the other side Jordan, Sihon and Og, whom ye utterlydestroyed. 

{2:11} And as soon as we had heard [these things,] ourhearts did melt, neither did there remain any more courage in any man,because of you: for the LORD your God, he [is] God in heaven above, andin earth beneath. 

{2:12} Now therefore, I pray you, swear unto me bythe LORD, since I have shewed you kindness, that ye will also shewkindness unto my father's house, and give me a true token: 

{2:13} And[that] ye will save alive my father, and my mother, and my brethren,and my sisters, and all that they have, and deliver our lives fromdeath. 

{2:14} And the men answered her, Our life for yours, if ye utternot this our business. And it shall be, when the LORD hath given us theland, that we will deal kindly and truly with thee. 

{2:15} Then she letthem down by a cord through the window: for her house [was] upon thetown wall, and she dwelt upon the wall. 

{2:16} And she said unto them,Get you to the mountain, lest the pursuers meet you; and hideyourselves there three days, until the pursuers be returned: andafterward may ye go your way. 

{2:17} And the men said unto her, We[will be] blameless of this thine oath which thou hast made us swear.

{2:18} Behold, [when] we come into the land, thou shalt bind this lineof scarlet thread in the window which thou didst let us down by: andthou shalt bring thy father, and thy mother, and thy brethren, and allthy father's household, home unto thee. 

{2:19} And it shall be, [that]whosoever shall go out of the doors of thy house into the street, hisblood [shall be] upon his head, and we [will be] guiltless: andwhosoever shall be with thee in the house, his blood [shall be] on ourhead, if [any] hand be upon him. 

{2:20} And if thou utter this ourbusiness, then we will be quit of thine oath which thou hast made us toswear. 

{2:21} And she said, According unto your words, so [be] it. Andshe sent them away, and they departed: and she bound the scarlet linein the window. 

{2:22} And they went, and came unto the mountain, andabode there three days, until the pursuers were returned: and thepursuers sought [them] throughout all the way, but found [them] not.   

{2:23} So the two men returned, and descended from the mountain, andpassed over, and came to Joshua the son of Nun, and told him all[things] that befell them: 

{2:24} And they said unto Joshua, Truly theLORD hath delivered into our hands all the land; for even all theinhabitants of the country do faint because of us.   

{3:1} And Joshua rose early in the morning; and they removed fromShittim, and came to Jordan, he and all the children of Israel, andlodged there before they passed over. 

{3:2} And it came to pass afterthree days, that the officers went through the host; 

{3:3} And theycommanded the people, saying, When ye see the ark of the covenant ofthe LORD your God, and the priests the Levites bearing it, then yeshall remove from your place, and go after it. 

{3:4} Yet there shall bea space between you and it, about two thousand cubits by measure: comenot near unto it, that ye may know the way by which ye must go: for yehave not passed this [way] heretofore. 

{3:5} And Joshua said unto thepeople, Sanctify yourselves: for to morrow the LORD will do wondersamong you. 

{3:6} And Joshua spake unto the priests, saying, Take up theark of the covenant, and pass over before the people. And they took upthe ark of the covenant, and went before the people.   

{3:7} And the LORD said unto Joshua, This day will I begin tomagnify thee in the sight of all Israel, that they may know that, as Iwas with Moses, so I will be with thee. 

{3:8} And thou shalt commandthe priests that bear the ark of the covenant, saying, When ye are cometo the brink of the water of Jordan, ye shall stand still in Jordan.   

{3:9} And Joshua said unto the children of Israel, Come hither, andhear the words of the LORD your God. 

{3:10} And Joshua said, Hereby yeshall know that the living God [is] among you, and [that] he willwithout fail drive out from before you the Canaanites, and theHittites, and the Hivites, and the Perizzites, and the Girgashites, andthe Amorites, and the Jebusites. 

{3:11} Behold, the ark of the covenantof the Lord of all the earth passeth over before you into Jordan.

{3:12} Now therefore take you twelve men out of the tribes of Israel,out of every tribe a man. 

{3:13} And it shall come to pass, as soon asthe soles of the feet of the priests that bear the ark of the LORD, theLord of all the earth, shall rest in the waters of Jordan, [that] thewaters of Jordan shall be cut off [from] the waters that come down fromabove; and they shall stand upon an heap.   

{3:14} And it came to pass, when the people removed from theirtents, to pass over Jordan, and the priests bearing the ark of thecovenant before the people; 

{3:15} And as they that bare the ark werecome unto Jordan, and the feet of the priests that bare the ark weredipped in the brim of the water, (for Jordan overfloweth all his banksall the time of harvest,) 

{3:16} That the waters which came down fromabove stood [and] rose up upon an heap very far from the city Adam,that [is] beside Zaretan: and those that came down toward the sea ofthe plain, [even] the salt sea, failed, [and] were cut off: and thepeople passed over right against Jericho. 

{3:17} And the priests thatbare the ark of the covenant of the LORD stood firm on dry ground inthe midst of Jordan, and all the Israelites passed over on dry ground,until all the people were passed clean over Jordan.   

{4:1} And it came to pass, when all the people were clean passedover Jordan, that the LORD spake unto Joshua, saying, 

{4:2} Take youtwelve men out of the people, out of every tribe a man, 

{4:3} Andcommand ye them, saying, Take you hence out of the midst of Jordan, outof the place where the priests' feet stood firm, twelve stones, and yeshall carry them over with you, and leave them in the lodging place,where ye shall lodge this night. 

{4:4} Then Joshua called the twelvemen, whom he had prepared of the children of Israel, out of every tribea man: 

{4:5} And Joshua said unto them, Pass over before the ark of theLORD your God into the midst of Jordan, and take ye up every man of youa stone upon his shoulder, according unto the number of the tribes ofthe children of Israel: 

{4:6} That this may be a sign among you, [that]when your children ask [their fathers] in time to come, saying, What[mean] ye by these stones? 

{4:7} Then ye shall answer them, That thewaters of Jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of theLORD; when it passed over Jordan, the waters of Jordan were cut off:and these stones shall be for a memorial unto the children of Israelfor ever. 

{4:8} And the children of Israel did so as Joshua commanded,and took up twelve stones out of the midst of Jordan, as the LORD spakeunto Joshua, according to the number of the tribes of the children ofIsrael, and carried them over with them unto the place where theylodged, and laid them down there. 

{4:9} And Joshua set up twelve stonesin the midst of Jordan, in the place where the feet of the priestswhich bare the ark of the covenant stood: and they are there unto thisday.   

{4:10} For the priests which bare the ark stood in the midst ofJordan, until every thing was finished that the LORD commanded Joshuato speak unto the people, according to all that Moses commanded Joshua:and the people hasted and passed over. 

{4:11} And it came to pass, whenall the people were clean passed over, that the ark of the LORD passedover, and the priests, in the presence of the people. 

{4:12} And thechildren of Reuben, and the children of Gad, and half the tribe ofManasseh, passed over armed before the children of Israel, as Mosesspake unto them: 

{4:13} About forty thousand prepared for war passedover before the LORD unto battle, to the plains of Jericho.   

{4:14} On that day the LORD magnified Joshua in the sight of allIsrael; and they feared him, as they feared Moses, all the days of hislife. 

{4:15} And the LORD spake unto Joshua, saying, 

{4:16} Command thepriests that bear the ark of the testimony, that they come up out ofJordan. 

{4:17} Joshua therefore commanded the priests, saying, Come yeup out of Jordan. 

{4:18} And it came to pass, when the priests thatbare the ark of the covenant of the LORD were come up out of the midstof Jordan, [and] the soles of the priests' feet were lifted up unto thedry land, that the waters of Jordan returned unto their place, andflowed over all his banks, as [they did] before.   

{4:19} And the people came up out of Jordan on the tenth [day] ofthe first month, and encamped in Gilgal, in the east border of Jericho.

{4:20} And those twelve stones, which they took out of Jordan, didJoshua pitch in Gilgal. 

{4:21} And he spake unto the children ofIsrael, saying, When your children shall ask their fathers in time tocome, saying, What [mean] these stones? 

{4:22} Then ye shall let yourchildren know, saying, Israel came over this Jordan on dry land. 

{4:23}For the LORD your God dried up the waters of Jordan from before you,until ye were passed over, as the LORD your God did to the Red sea,which he dried up from before us, until we were gone over: 

{4:24} Thatall the people of the earth might know the hand of the LORD, that it[is] mighty: that ye might fear the LORD your God for ever.   

{5:1} And it came to pass, when all the kings of the Amorites, which[were] on the side of Jordan westward, and all the kings of theCanaanites, which [were] by the sea, heard that the LORD had dried upthe waters of Jordan from before the children of Israel, until we werepassed over, that their heart melted, neither was there spirit in themany more, because of the children of Israel.   

{5:2} At that time the LORD said unto Joshua, Make thee sharpknives, and circumcise again the children of Israel the second time.

{5:3} And Joshua made him sharp knives, and circumcised the children ofIsrael at the hill of the foreskins. 

{5:4} And this [is] the cause whyJoshua did circumcise: All the people that came out of Egypt, [thatwere] males, [even] all the men of war, died in the wilderness by theway, after they came out of Egypt. 

{5:5} Now all the people that cameout were circumcised: but all the people [that were] born in thewilderness by the way as they came forth out of Egypt, [them] they hadnot circumcised. 

{5:6} For the children of Israel walked forty years inthe wilderness, till all the people [that were] men of war, which cameout of Egypt, were consumed, because they obeyed not the voice of theLORD: unto whom the LORD sware that he would not shew them the land,which the LORD sware unto their fathers that he would give us, a landthat floweth with milk and honey. 

{5:7} And their children, [whom] heraised up in their stead, them Joshua circumcised: for they wereuncircumcised, because they had not circumcised them by the way. 

{5:8}And it came to pass, when they had done circumcising all the people,that they abode in their places in the camp, till they were whole.

{5:9} And the LORD said unto Joshua, This day have I rolled away thereproach of Egypt from off you. Wherefore the name of the place iscalled Gilgal unto this day.   

{5:10} And the children of Israel encamped in Gilgal, and kept thepassover on the fourteenth day of the month at even in the plains ofJericho. 

{5:11} And they did eat of the old corn of the land on themorrow after the passover, unleavened cakes, and parched [corn] in theselfsame day.   

{5:12} And the manna ceased on the morrow after they had eaten ofthe old corn of the land; neither had the children of Israel manna anymore; but they did eat of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year.   

{5:13} And it came to pass, when Joshua was by Jericho, that helifted up his eyes and looked, and, behold, there stood a man overagainst him with his sword drawn in his hand: and Joshua went unto him,and said unto him, [Art] thou for us, or for our adversaries?   

{5:14} And he said, Nay; but [as] captain of the host of the LORD amI now come. And Joshua fell on his face to the earth, and did worship,and said unto him, What saith my lord unto his servant? 

{5:15} And thecaptain of the LORD'S host said unto Joshua, Loose thy shoe from offthy foot; for the place whereon thou standest [is] holy. And Joshua didso.   

{6:1} Now Jericho was straitly shut up because of the children ofIsrael: none went out, and none came in. 

{6:2} And the LORD said untoJoshua, See, I have given into thine hand Jericho, and the kingthereof, [and] the mighty men of valour. 

{6:3} And ye shall compass thecity, all [ye] men of war, [and] go round about the city once. Thusshalt thou do six days. 

{6:4} And seven priests shall bear before theark seven trumpets of rams horns: and the seventh day ye shall compassthe city seven times, and the priests shall blow with the trumpets.

{6:5} And it shall come to pass, that when they make a long [blast]with the ram's horn, [and] when ye hear the sound of the trumpet, allthe people shall shout with a great shout; and the wall of the cityshall fall down flat, and the people shall ascend up every man straightbefore him.   

{6:6} And Joshua the son of Nun called the priests, and said untothem, Take up the ark of the covenant, and let seven priests bear seventrumpets of rams' horns before the ark of the LORD. 

{6:7} And he saidunto the people, Pass on, and compass the city, and let him that isarmed pass on before the ark of the LORD.   

{6:8} And it came to pass, when Joshua had spoken unto the people,that the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams' horns passedon before the LORD, and blew with the trumpets: and the ark of thecovenant of the LORD followed them.   

{6:9} And the armed men went before the priests that blew with thetrumpets, and the rereward came after the ark, [the priests] going on,and blowing with the trumpets. 

{6:10} And Joshua had commanded thepeople, saying, Ye shall not shout, nor make any noise with your voice,neither shall [any] word proceed out of your mouth, until the day I bidyou shout; then shall ye shout. 

{6:11} So the ark of the LORD compassedthe city, going about [it] once: and they came into the camp, andlodged in the camp.   

{6:12} And Joshua rose early in the morning, and the priests took upthe ark of the LORD. 

{6:13} And seven priests bearing seven trumpets oframs' horns before the ark of the LORD went on continually, and blewwith the trumpets: and the armed men went before them; but the rerewardcame after the ark of the LORD, [the priests] going on, and blowingwith the trumpets. 

{6:14} And the second day they compassed the cityonce, and returned into the camp: so they did six days. 

{6:15} And itcame to pass on the seventh day, that they rose early about the dawningof the day, and compassed the city after the same manner seven times:only on that day they compassed the city seven times. 

{6:16} And itcame to pass at the seventh time, when the priests blew with thetrumpets, Joshua said unto the people, Shout; for the LORD hath givenyou the city.   

{6:17} And the city shall be accursed, [even] it, and all that [are]therein, to the LORD: only Rahab the harlot shall live, she and allthat [are] with her in the house, because she hid the messengers thatwe sent. 

{6:18} And ye, in any wise keep [yourselves] from the accursedthing, lest ye make [yourselves] accursed, when ye take of the accursedthing, and make the camp of Israel a curse, and trouble it. 

{6:19} Butall the silver, and gold, and vessels of brass and iron, [are]consecrated unto the LORD: they shall come into the treasury of theLORD. 

{6:20} So the people shouted when [the priests] blew with thetrumpets: and it came to pass, when the people heard the sound of thetrumpet, and the people shouted with a great shout, that the wall felldown flat, so that the people went up into the city, every man straightbefore him, and they took the city. 

{6:21} And they utterly destroyedall that [was] in the city, both man and woman, young and old, and ox,and sheep, and ass, with the edge of the sword. 

{6:22} But Joshua hadsaid unto the two men that had spied out the country, Go into theharlot's house, and bring out thence the woman, and all that she hath,as ye sware unto her. 

{6:23} And the young men that were spies went in,and brought Rahab, and her father, and her mother, and her brethren,and all that she had; and they brought out all her kindred, and leftthem without the camp of Israel. 

{6:24} And they burnt the city withfire, and all that [was] therein: only the silver, and the gold, andthe vessels of brass and of iron, they put into the treasury of thehouse of the LORD. 

{6:25} And Joshua saved Rahab the harlot alive, andher father's household, and all that she had; and she dwelleth inIsrael [even] unto this day; because she hid the messengers, whichJoshua sent to spy out Jericho. 

{6:26} And Joshua adjured [them] atthat time, saying, Cursed [be] the man before the LORD, that riseth upand buildeth this city Jericho: he shall lay the foundation thereof inhis firstborn, and in his youngest [son] shall he set up the gates ofit. 

{6:27} So the LORD was with Joshua; and his fame was [noised]throughout all the country.   

{7:1} But the children of Israel committed a trespass in theaccursed thing: for Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the sonof Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took of the accursed thing: and theanger of the LORD was kindled against the children of Israel. 

{7:2} AndJoshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which [is] beside Beth-aven, on theeast side of Bethel, and spake unto them, saying, Go up and view thecountry. And the men went up and viewed Ai. 

{7:3} And they returned toJoshua, and said unto him, Let not all the people go up; but let abouttwo or three thousand men go up and smite Ai; [and] make not all thepeople to labour thither; for they [are but] few. 

{7:4} So there wentup thither of the people about three thousand men: and they fled beforethe men of Ai. 

{7:5} And the men of Ai smote of them about thirty andsix men: for they chased them [from] before the gate [even] untoShebarim, and smote them in the going down: wherefore the hearts of thepeople melted, and became as water.   

{7:6} And Joshua rent his clothes, and fell to the earth upon hisface before the ark of the LORD until the eventide, he and the eldersof Israel, and put dust upon their heads. 

{7:7} And Joshua said, Alas,O Lord GOD, wherefore hast thou at all brought this people over Jordan,to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us? would toGod we had been content, and dwelt on the other side Jordan! 

{7:8} OLord, what shall I say, when Israel turneth their backs before theirenemies! 

{7:9} For the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the landshall hear [of it,] and shall environ us round, and cut off our namefrom the earth: and what wilt thou do unto thy great name? 

{7:10} Andthe LORD said unto Joshua, Get thee up; wherefore liest thou thus uponthy face? 

{7:11} Israel hath sinned, and they have also transgressed mycovenant which I commanded them: for they have even taken of theaccursed thing, and have also stolen, and dissembled also, and theyhave put [it] even among their own stuff. 

{7:12} Therefore the childrenof Israel could not stand before their enemies, [but] turned [their]backs before their enemies, because they were accursed: neither will Ibe with you any more, except ye destroy the accursed from among you.

{7:13} Up, sanctify the people, and say, Sanctify yourselves against tomorrow: for thus saith the LORD God of Israel, [There is] an accursedthing in the midst of thee, O Israel: thou canst not stand before thineenemies, until ye take away the accursed thing from among you. 

{7:14}In the morning therefore ye shall be brought according to your tribes:and it shall be, [that] the tribe which the LORD taketh shall comeaccording to the families [thereof;] and the family which the LORDshall take shall come by households; and the household which the LORDshall take shall come man by man. 

{7:15} And it shall be, [that] hethat is taken with the accursed thing shall be burnt with fire, he andall that he hath: because he hath transgressed the covenant of theLORD, and because he hath wrought folly in Israel.   

{7:16} So Joshua rose up early in the morning, and brought Israel bytheir tribes; and the tribe of Judah was taken: 

{7:17} And he broughtthe family of Judah; and he took the family of the Zarhites: and hebrought the family of the Zarhites man by man; and Zabdi was taken:

{7:18} And he brought his household man by man; and Achan, the son ofCarmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, wastaken. 

{7:19} And Joshua said unto Achan, My son, give, I pray thee,glory to the LORD God of Israel, and make confession unto him; and tellme now what thou hast done; hide [it] not from me. 

{7:20} And Achananswered Joshua, and said, Indeed I have sinned against the LORD God ofIsrael, and thus and thus have I done: 

{7:21} When I saw among thespoils a goodly Babylonish garment, and two hundred shekels of silver,and a wedge of gold of fifty shekels weight, then I coveted them, andtook them; and, behold, they [are] hid in the earth in the midst of mytent, and the silver under it.   

{7:22} So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran unto the tent; and,behold, [it was] hid in his tent, and the silver under it. 

{7:23} Andthey took them out of the midst of the tent, and brought them untoJoshua, and unto all the children of Israel, and laid them out beforethe LORD. 

{7:24} And Joshua, and all Israel with him, took Achan theson of Zerah, and the silver, and the garment, and the wedge of gold,and his sons, and his daughters, and his oxen, and his asses, and hissheep, and his tent, and all that he had: and they brought them untothe valley of Achor. 

{7:25} And Joshua said, Why hast thou troubled us?the LORD shall trouble thee this day. And all Israel stoned him withstones, and burned them with fire, after they had stoned them withstones. 

{7:26} And they raised over him a great heap of stones untothis day. So the LORD turned from the fierceness of his anger.Wherefore the name of that place was called, The valley of Achor, untothis day.   

{8:1} And the LORD said unto Joshua, Fear not, neither be thoudismayed: take all the people of war with thee, and arise, go up to Ai:see, I have given into thy hand the king of Ai, and his people, and hiscity, and his land: 

{8:2} And thou shalt do to Ai and her king as thoudidst unto Jericho and her king: only the spoil thereof, and the cattlethereof, shall ye take for a prey unto yourselves: lay thee an ambushfor the city behind it.   

{8:3} So Joshua arose, and all the people of war, to go up againstAi: and Joshua chose out thirty thousand mighty men of valour, and sentthem away by night. 

{8:4} And he commanded them, saying, Behold, yeshall lie in wait against the city, [even] behind the city: go not veryfar from the city, but be ye all ready: 

{8:5} And I, and all the peoplethat [are] with me, will approach unto the city: and it shall come topass, when they come out against us, as at the first, that we will fleebefore them, 

{8:6} (For they will come out after us) till we have drawnthem from the city; for they will say, They flee before us, as at thefirst: therefore we will flee before them. 

{8:7} Then ye shall rise upfrom the ambush, and seize upon the city: for the LORD your God willdeliver it into your hand. 

{8:8} And it shall be, when ye have takenthe city, [that] ye shall set the city on fire: according to thecommandment of the LORD shall ye do. See, I have commanded you. 

{8:9}Joshua therefore sent them forth: and they went to lie in ambush, andabode between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of Ai: but Joshua lodgedthat night among the people. 

{8:10} And Joshua rose up early in themorning, and numbered the people, and went up, he and the elders ofIsrael, before the people to Ai. 

{8:11} And all the people, [even thepeople] of war that [were] with him, went up, and drew nigh, and camebefore the city, and pitched on the north side of Ai: now [there was] avalley between them and Ai. 

{8:12} And he took about five thousand men,and set them to lie in ambush between Bethel and Ai, on the west sideof the city. 

{8:13} And when they had set the people, [even] all thehost that [was] on the north of the city, and their liers in wait onthe west of the city, Joshua went that night into the midst of thevalley.   

{8:14} And it came to pass, when the king of Ai saw [it,] that theyhasted and rose up early, and the men of the city went out againstIsrael to battle, he and all his people, at a time appointed, beforethe plain; but he wist not that [there were] liers in ambush againsthim behind the city. 

{8:15} And Joshua and all Israel made as if theywere beaten before them, and fled by the way of the wilderness. 

{8:16}And all the people that [were] in Ai were called together to pursueafter them: and they pursued after Joshua, and were drawn away from thecity. 

{8:17} And there was not a man left in Ai or Bethel, that wentnot out after Israel: and they left the city open, and pursued afterIsrael. 

{8:18} And the LORD said unto Joshua, Stretch out the spearthat [is] in thy hand toward Ai; for I will give it into thine hand.And Joshua stretched out the spear that [he had] in his hand toward thecity. 

{8:19} And the ambush arose quickly out of their place, and theyran as soon as he had stretched out his hand: and they entered into thecity, and took it, and hasted and set the city on fire. 

{8:20} And whenthe men of Ai looked behind them, they saw, and, behold, the smoke ofthe city ascended up to heaven, and they had no power to flee this wayor that way: and the people that fled to the wilderness turned backupon the pursuers. 

{8:21} And when Joshua and all Israel saw that theambush had taken the city, and that the smoke of the city ascended,then they turned again, and slew the men of Ai. 

{8:22} And the otherissued out of the city against them; so they were in the midst ofIsrael, some on this side, and some on that side: and they smote them,so that they let none of them remain or escape. 

{8:23} And the king ofAi they took alive, and brought him to Joshua. 

{8:24} And it came topass, when Israel had made an end of slaying all the inhabitants of Aiin the field, in the wilderness wherein they chased them, and when theywere all fallen on the edge of the sword, until they were consumed,that all the Israelites returned unto Ai, and smote it with the edge ofthe sword. 

{8:25} And [so] it was, [that] all that fell that day, bothof men and women, [were] twelve thousand, [even] all the men of Ai.

{8:26} For Joshua drew not his hand back, wherewith he stretched outthe spear, until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai.

{8:27} Only the cattle and the spoil of that city Israel took for aprey unto themselves, according unto the word of the LORD which hecommanded Joshua. 

{8:28} And Joshua burnt Ai, and made it an heap forever, [even] a desolation unto this day. 

{8:29} And the king of Ai hehanged on a tree until eventide: and as soon as the sun was down,Joshua commanded that they should take his carcase down from the tree,and cast it at the entering of the gate of the city, and raise thereona great heap of stones, [that remaineth] unto this day.   

{8:30} Then Joshua built an altar unto the LORD God of Israel inmount Ebal, 

{8:31} As Moses the servant of the LORD commanded thechildren of Israel, as it is written in the book of the law of Moses,an altar of whole stones, over which no man hath lift up [any] iron:and they offered thereon burnt offerings unto the LORD, and sacrificedpeace offerings.   

{8:32} And he wrote there upon the stones a copy of the law ofMoses, which he wrote in the presence of the children of Israel. 

{8:33}And all Israel, and their elders, and officers, and their judges, stoodon this side the ark and on that side before the priests the Levites,which bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD, as well the stranger,as he that was born among them; half of them over against mountGerizim, and half of them over against mount Ebal; as Moses the servantof the LORD had commanded before, that they should bless the people ofIsrael. 

{8:34} And afterward he read all the words of the law, theblessings and cursings, according to all that is written in the book ofthe law. 

{8:35} There was not a word of all that Moses commanded, whichJoshua read not before all the congregation of Israel, with the women,and the little ones, and the strangers that were conversant among them.   

{9:1} And it came to pass, when all the kings which [were] on thisside Jordan, in the hills, and in the valleys, and in all the coasts ofthe great sea over against Lebanon, the Hittite, and the Amorite, theCanaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite, heard [thereof;]

{9:2} That they gathered themselves together, to fight with Joshua andwith Israel, with one accord.   

{9:3} And when the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua had doneunto Jericho and to Ai, 

{9:4} They did work wilily, and went and madeas if they had been ambassadors, and took old sacks upon their asses,and wine bottles, old, and rent, and bound up; 

{9:5} And old shoes andclouted upon their feet, and old garments upon them; and all the breadof their provision was dry [and] mouldy. 

{9:6} And they went to Joshuaunto the camp at Gilgal, and said unto him, and to the men of Israel,We be come from a far country: now therefore make ye a league with us.

{9:7} And the men of Israel said unto the Hivites, Peradventure yedwell among us; and how shall we make a league with you? 

{9:8} And theysaid unto Joshua, We [are] thy servants. And Joshua said unto them, Who[are] ye? and from whence come ye? 

{9:9} And they said unto him, From avery far country thy servants are come because of the name of the LORDthy God: for we have heard the fame of him, and all that he did inEgypt, 

{9:10} And all that he did to the two kings of the Amorites,that [were] beyond Jordan, to Sihon king of Heshbon, and to Og king ofBashan, which [was] at Ashtaroth. 

{9:11} Wherefore our elders and allthe inhabitants of our country spake to us, saying, Take victuals withyou for the journey, and go to meet them, and say unto them, We [are]your servants: therefore now make ye a league with us. 

{9:12} This ourbread we took hot [for] our provision out of our houses on the day wecame forth to go unto you; but now, behold, it is dry, and it ismouldy: 

{9:13} And these bottles of wine, which we filled, [were] new;and, behold, they be rent: and these our garments and our shoes arebecome old by reason of the very long journey. 

{9:14} And the men tookof their victuals, and asked not [counsel] at the mouth of the LORD.

{9:15} And Joshua made peace with them, and made a league with them, tolet them live: and the princes of the congregation sware unto them.   

{9:16} And it came to pass at the end of three days after they hadmade a league with them, that they heard that they [were] theirneighbours, and [that] they dwelt among them. 

{9:17} And the childrenof Israel journeyed, and came unto their cities on the third day. Nowtheir cities [were] Gibeon, and Chephirah, and Beeroth, andKirjath-jearim. 

{9:18} And the children of Israel smote them not,because the princes of the congregation had sworn unto them by the LORDGod of Israel. And all the congregation murmured against the princes.

{9:19} But all the princes said unto all the congregation, We havesworn unto them by the LORD God of Israel: now therefore we may nottouch them. 

{9:20} This we will do to them; we will even let them live,lest wrath be upon us, because of the oath which we sware unto them.

{9:21} And the princes said unto them, Let them live; but let them behewers of wood and drawers of water unto all the congregation; as theprinces had promised them.   

{9:22} And Joshua called for them, and he spake unto them, saying,Wherefore have ye beguiled us, saying, We [are] very far from you; whenye dwell among us? 

{9:23} Now therefore ye [are] cursed, and thereshall none of you be freed from being bondmen, and hewers of wood anddrawers of water for the house of my God. 

{9:24} And they answeredJoshua, and said, Because it was certainly told thy servants, how thatthe LORD thy God commanded his servant Moses to give you all the land,and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land from before you,therefore we were sore afraid of our lives because of you, and havedone this thing. 

{9:25} And now, behold, we [are] in thine hand: as itseemeth good and right unto thee to do unto us, do. 

{9:26} And so didhe unto them, and delivered them out of the hand of the children ofIsrael, that they slew them not. 

{9:27} And Joshua made them that dayhewers of wood and drawers of water for the congregation, and for thealtar of the LORD, even unto this day, in the place which he shouldchoose.   

{10:1} Now it came to pass, when Adoni-zedek king of Jerusalem hadheard how Joshua had taken Ai, and had utterly destroyed it; as he haddone to Jericho and her king, so he had done to Ai and her king; andhow the inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace with Israel, and wereamong them; 

{10:2} That they feared greatly, because Gibeon [was] agreat city, as one of the royal cities, and because it [was] greaterthan Ai, and all the men thereof [were] mighty. 

{10:3} WhereforeAdoni-zedek king of Jerusalem sent unto Hoham king of Hebron, and untoPiram king of Jarmuth, and unto Japhia king of Lachish, and unto Debirking of Eglon, saying, 

{10:4} Come up unto me, and help me, that we maysmite Gibeon: for it hath made peace with Joshua and with the childrenof Israel. 

{10:5} Therefore the five kings of the Amorites, the king ofJerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king ofLachish, the king of Eglon, gathered themselves together, and went up,they and all their hosts, and encamped before Gibeon, and made waragainst it.   

{10:6} And the men of Gibeon sent unto Joshua to the camp to Gilgal,saying, Slack not thy hand from thy servants; come up to us quickly,and save us, and help us: for all the kings of the Amorites that dwellin the mountains are gathered together against us. 

{10:7} So Joshuaascended from Gilgal, he, and all the people of war with him, and allthe mighty men of valour.   

{10:8} And the LORD said unto Joshua, Fear them not: for I havedelivered them into thine hand; there shall not a man of them standbefore thee. 

{10:9} Joshua therefore came unto them suddenly, [and]went up from Gilgal all night. 

{10:10} And the LORD discomfited thembefore Israel, and slew them with a great slaughter at Gibeon, andchased them along the way that goeth up to Beth-horon, and smote themto Azekah, and unto Makkedah. 

{10:11} And it came to pass, as they fledfrom before Israel, [and] were in the going down to Beth-horon, thatthe LORD cast down great stones from heaven upon them unto Azekah, andthey died: [they were] more which died with hailstones than they whomthe children of Israel slew with the sword.   

{10:12} Then spake Joshua to the LORD in the day when the LORDdelivered up the Amorites before the children of Israel, and he said inthe sight of Israel, Sun, stand thou still upon Gibeon; and thou, Moon,in the valley of Ajalon. 

{10:13} And the sun stood still, and the moonstayed, until the people had avenged themselves upon their enemies.[Is] not this written in the book of Jasher? So the sun stood still inthe midst of heaven, and hasted not to go down about a whole day.

{10:14} And there was no day like that before it or after it, that theLORD hearkened unto the voice of a man: for the LORD fought for Israel.   

{10:15} And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, unto the campto Gilgal. 

{10:16} But these five kings fled, and hid themselves in acave at Makkedah. 

{10:17} And it was told Joshua, saying, The fivekings are found hid in a cave at Makkedah. 

{10:18} And Joshua said,Roll great stones upon the mouth of the cave, and set men by it for tokeep them: 

{10:19} And stay ye not, [but] pursue after your enemies,and smite the hindmost of them; suffer them not to enter into theircities: for the LORD your God hath delivered them into your hand.

{10:20} And it came to pass, when Joshua and the children of Israel hadmade an end of slaying them with a very great slaughter, till they wereconsumed, that the rest [which] remained of them entered into fencedcities. 

{10:21} And all the people returned to the camp to Joshua atMakkedah in peace: none moved his tongue against any of the children ofIsrael. 

{10:22} Then said Joshua, Open the mouth of the cave, and bringout those five kings unto me out of the cave. 

{10:23} And they did so,and brought forth those five kings unto him out of the cave, the kingof Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king ofLachish, [and] the king of Eglon. 

{10:24} And it came to pass, whenthey brought out those kings unto Joshua, that Joshua called for allthe men of Israel, and said unto the captains of the men of war whichwent with him, Come near, put your feet upon the necks of these kings.And they came near, and put their feet upon the necks of them. 

{10:25}And Joshua said unto them, Fear not, nor be dismayed, be strong and ofgood courage: for thus shall the LORD do to all your enemies againstwhom ye fight. 

{10:26} And afterward Joshua smote them, and slew them,and hanged them on five trees: and they were hanging upon the treesuntil the evening. 

{10:27} And it came to pass at the time of the goingdown of the sun, [that] Joshua commanded, and they took them down offthe trees, and cast them into the cave wherein they had been hid, andlaid great stones in the cave's mouth, [which remain] until this veryday.   

{10:28} And that day Joshua took Makkedah, and smote it with theedge of the sword, and the king thereof he utterly destroyed, them, andall the souls [that were] therein; he let none remain: and he did tothe king of Makkedah as he did unto the king of Jericho. 

{10:29} ThenJoshua passed from Makkedah, and all Israel with him, unto Libnah, andfought against Libnah: 

{10:30} And the LORD delivered it also, and theking thereof, into the hand of Israel; and he smote it with the edge ofthe sword, and all the souls that [were] therein; he let none remain init; but did unto the king thereof as he did unto the king of Jericho.   

{10:31} And Joshua passed from Libnah, and all Israel with him, untoLachish, and encamped against it, and fought against it: 

{10:32} Andthe LORD delivered Lachish into the hand of Israel, which took it onthe second day, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and all thesouls that [were] therein, according to all that he had done to Libnah.   

{10:33} Then Horam king of Gezer came up to help Lachish; and Joshuasmote him and his people, until he had left him none remaining.   

{10:34} And from Lachish Joshua passed unto Eglon, and all Israelwith him; and they encamped against it, and fought against it: 

{10:35}And they took it on that day, and smote it with the edge of the sword,and all the souls that [were] therein he utterly destroyed that day,according to all that he had done to Lachish. 

{10:36} And Joshua wentup from Eglon, and all Israel with him, unto Hebron; and they foughtagainst it: 

{10:37} And they took it, and smote it with the edge of thesword, and the king thereof, and all the cities thereof, and all thesouls that [were] therein; he left none remaining, according to allthat he had done to Eglon; but destroyed it utterly, and all the soulsthat [were] therein.   

{10:38} And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to Debir; andfought against it: 

{10:39} And he took it, and the king thereof, andall the cities thereof; and they smote them with the edge of the sword,and utterly destroyed all the souls that [were] therein; he left noneremaining: as he had done to Hebron, so he did to Debir, and to theking thereof; as he had done also to Libnah, and to her king.   

{10:40} So Joshua smote all the country of the hills, and of thesouth, and of the vale, and of the springs, and all their kings: heleft none remaining, but utterly destroyed all that breathed, as theLORD God of Israel commanded. 

{10:41} And Joshua smote them fromKadesh-barnea even unto Gaza, and all the country of Goshen, even untoGibeon. 

{10:42} And all these kings and their land did Joshua take atone time, because the LORD God of Israel fought for Israel. 

{10:43} AndJoshua returned, and all Israel with him, unto the camp to Gilgal.   

{11:1} And it came to pass, when Jabin king of Hazor had heard[those things,] that he sent to Jobab king of Madon, and to the king ofShimron, and to the king of Achshaph, 

{11:2} And to the kings that[were] on the north of the mountains, and of the plains south ofChinneroth, and in the valley, and in the borders of Dor on the west,

{11:3} [And to] the Canaanite on the east and on the west, and [to] theAmorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Jebusite in themountains, and [to] the Hivite under Hermon in the land of Mizpeh.

{11:4} And they went out, they and all their hosts with them, muchpeople, even as the sand that [is] upon the sea shore in multitude,with horses and chariots very many. 

{11:5} And when all these kingswere met together, they came and pitched together at the waters ofMerom, to fight against Israel.   

{11:6} And the LORD said unto Joshua, Be not afraid because of them:for to morrow about this time will I deliver them up all slain beforeIsrael: thou shalt hough their horses, and burn their chariots withfire. 

{11:7} So Joshua came, and all the people of war with him,against them by the waters of Merom suddenly; and they fell upon them.

{11:8} And the LORD delivered them into the hand of Israel, who smotethem, and chased them unto great Zidon, and unto Misrephoth-maim, andunto the valley of Mizpeh eastward; and they smote them, until theyleft them none remaining. 

{11:9} And Joshua did unto them as the LORDbade him: he houghed their horses, and burnt their chariots with fire.   

{11:10} And Joshua at that time turned back, and took Hazor, andsmote the king thereof with the sword: for Hazor beforetime was thehead of all those kingdoms. 

{11:11} And they smote all the souls that[were] therein with the edge of the sword, utterly destroying [them:]there was not any left to breathe: and he burnt Hazor with fire.

{11:12} And all the cities of those kings, and all the kings of them,did Joshua take, and smote them with the edge of the sword, [and] heutterly destroyed them, as Moses the servant of the LORD commanded.

{11:13} But [as for] the cities that stood still in their strength,Israel burned none of them, save Hazor only; [that] did Joshua burn.

{11:14} And all the spoil of these cities, and the cattle, the childrenof Israel took for a prey unto themselves; but every man they smotewith the edge of the sword, until they had destroyed them, neither leftthey any to breathe.   

{11:15} As the LORD commanded Moses his servant, so did Mosescommand Joshua, and so did Joshua; he left nothing undone of all thatthe LORD commanded Moses. 

{11:16} So Joshua took all that land, thehills, and all the south country, and all the land of Goshen, and thevalley, and the plain, and the mountain of Israel, and the valley ofthe same; 

{11:17} [Even] from the mount Halak, that goeth up to Seir,even unto Baal-gad in the valley of Lebanon under mount Hermon: and alltheir kings he took, and smote them, and slew them. 

{11:18} Joshua madewar a long time with all those kings. 

{11:19} There was not a city thatmade peace with the children of Israel, save the Hivites theinhabitants of Gibeon: all [other] they took in battle. 

{11:20} For itwas of the LORD to harden their hearts, that they should come againstIsrael in battle, that he might destroy them utterly, [and] that theymight have no favour, but that he might destroy them, as the LORDcommanded Moses.   

{11:21} And at that time came Joshua, and cut off the Anakims fromthe mountains, from Hebron, from Debir, from Anab, and from all themountains of Judah, and from all the mountains of Israel: Joshuadestroyed them utterly with their cities. 

{11:22} There was none of theAnakims left in the land of the children of Israel: only in Gaza, inGath, and in Ashdod, there remained. 

{11:23} So Joshua took the wholeland, according to all that the LORD said unto Moses; and Joshua gaveit for an inheritance unto Israel according to their divisions by theirtribes. And the land rested from war.   

{12:1} Now these [are] the kings of the land, which the children ofIsrael smote, and possessed their land on the other side Jordan towardthe rising of the sun, from the river Arnon unto mount Hermon, and allthe plain on the east: 

{12:2} Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt inHeshbon, [and] ruled from Aroer, which [is] upon the bank of the riverArnon, and from the middle of the river, and from half Gilead, evenunto the river Jabbok, [which is] the border of the children of Ammon;

{12:3} And from the plain to the sea of Chinneroth on the east, andunto the sea of the plain, [even] the salt sea on the east, the way toBeth-jeshimoth; and from the south, under Ashdoth-pisgah:   

{12:4} And the coast of Og king of Bashan, [which was] of theremnant of the giants, that dwelt at Ashtaroth and at Edrei, 

{12:5} Andreigned in mount Hermon, and in Salcah, and in all Bashan, unto theborder of the Geshurites and the Maachathites, and half Gilead, theborder of Sihon king of Heshbon. 

{12:6} Them did Moses the servant ofthe LORD and the children of Israel smite: and Moses the servant of theLORD gave it [for] a possession unto the Reubenites, and the Gadites,and the half tribe of Manasseh.   

{12:7} And these [are] the kings of the country which Joshua and thechildren of Israel smote on this side Jordan on the west, from Baal-gadin the valley of Lebanon even unto the mount Halak, that goeth up toSeir; which Joshua gave unto the tribes of Israel [for] a possessionaccording to their divisions; 

{12:8} In the mountains, and in thevalleys, and in the plains, and in the springs, and in the wilderness,and in the south country; the Hittites, the Amorites, and theCanaanites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites:   

{12:9} The king of Jericho, one; the king of Ai, which [is] besideBethel, one; 

{12:10} The king of Jerusalem, one; the king of Hebron,one; 

{12:11} The king of Jarmuth, one; the king of Lachish, one;

{12:12} The king of Eglon, one; the king of Gezer, one; 

{12:13} Theking of Debir, one; the king of Geder, one; 

{12:14} The king of Hormah,one; the king of Arad, one; 

{12:15} The king of Libnah, one; the kingof Adullam, one; 

{12:16} The king of Makkedah, one; the king of Bethel,one; 

{12:17} The king of Tappuah, one; the king of Hepher, one; 

{12:18}The king of Aphek, one; the king of Lasharon, one; 

{12:19} The king ofMadon, one; the king of Hazor, one; 

{12:20} The king of Shimron-meron,one; the king of Achshaph, one; 

{12:21} The king of Taanach, one; theking of Megiddo, one; 

{12:22} The king of Kedesh, one; the king ofJokneam of Carmel, one; 

{12:23} The king of Dor in the coast of Dor,one; the king of the nations of Gilgal, one; 

{12:24} The king ofTirzah, one: all the kings thirty and one.   

{13:1} Now Joshua was old [and] stricken in years; and the LORD saidunto him, Thou art old [and] stricken in years, and there remaineth yetvery much land to be possessed. 

{13:2} This [is] the land that yetremaineth: all the borders of the Philistines, and all Geshuri, 

{13:3}From Sihor, which [is] before Egypt, even unto the borders of Ekronnorthward, [which] is counted to the Canaanite: five lords of thePhilistines; the Gazathites, and the Ashdothites, the Eshkalonites, theGittites, and the Ekronites; also the Avites: 

{13:4} From the south,all the land of the Canaanites, and Mearah that [is] beside theSidonians, unto Aphek, to the borders of the Amorites: 

{13:5} And theland of the Giblites, and all Lebanon, toward the sunrising, fromBaal-gad under mount Hermon unto the entering into Hamath. 

{13:6} Allthe inhabitants of the hill country from Lebanon unto Misrephoth-maim,[and] all the Sidonians, them will I drive out from before the childrenof Israel: only divide thou it by lot unto the Israelites for aninheritance, as I have commanded thee. 

{13:7} Now therefore divide thisland for an inheritance unto the nine tribes, and the half tribe ofManasseh, 

{13:8} With whom the Reubenites and the Gadites have receivedtheir inheritance, which Moses gave them, beyond Jordan eastward,[even] as Moses the servant of the LORD gave them; 

{13:9} From Aroer,that [is] upon the bank of the river Arnon, and the city that [is] inthe midst of the river, and all the plain of Medeba unto Dibon; 

{13:10}And all the cities of Sihon king of the Amorites, which reigned inHeshbon, unto the border of the children of Ammon; 

{13:11} And Gilead,and the border of the Geshurites and Maachathites, and all mountHermon, and all Bashan unto Salcah; 

{13:12} All the kingdom of Og inBashan, which reigned in Ashtaroth and in Edrei, who remained of theremnant of the giants: for these did Moses smite, and cast them out.

{13:13} Nevertheless the children of Israel expelled not theGeshurites, nor the Maachathites: but the Geshurites and theMaachathites dwell among the Israelites until this day. 

{13:14} Onlyunto the tribe of Levi he gave none inheritance; the sacrifices of theLORD God of Israel made by fire [are] their inheritance, as he saidunto them.   

{13:15} And Moses gave unto the tribe of the children of Reuben[inheritance] according to their families. 

{13:16} And their coast wasfrom Aroer, that [is] on the bank of the river Arnon, and the city that[is] in the midst of the river, and all the plain by Medeba; 

{13:17}Heshbon, and all her cities that [are] in the plain; Dibon, and Bamoth-baal, and Beth-baal-meon, 

{13:18} And Jahaza, and Kedemoth, andMephaath, 

{13:19} And Kirjathaim, and Sibmah, and Zareth-shahar in themount of the valley, 

{13:20} And Beth- peor, and Ashdoth-pisgah, andBeth-jeshimoth, 

{13:21} And all the cities of the plain, and all thekingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites, which reigned in Heshbon, whomMoses smote with the princes of Midian, Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, andHur, and Reba, [which were] dukes of Sihon, dwelling in the country.   

{13:22} Balaam also the son of Beor, the soothsayer, did thechildren of Israel slay with the sword among them that were slain bythem. 

{13:23} And the border of the children of Reuben was Jordan, andthe border [thereof.] This [was] the inheritance of the children ofReuben after their families, the cities and the villages thereof.

{13:24} And Moses gave [inheritance] unto the tribe of Gad, [even] untothe children of Gad according to their families. 

{13:25} And theircoast was Jazer, and all the cities of Gilead, and half the land of thechildren of Ammon, unto Aroer that [is] before Rabbah; 

{13:26} And fromHeshbon unto Ramath-mizpeh, and Betonim; and from Mahanaim unto theborder of Debir; 

{13:27} And in the valley, Beth-aram, and Beth-nimrah,and Succoth, and Zaphon, the rest of the kingdom of Sihon king ofHeshbon, Jordan and [his] border, [even] unto the edge of the sea ofChinnereth on the other side Jordan eastward. 

{13:28} This [is] theinheritance of the children of Gad after their families, the cities,and their villages.   

{13:29} And Moses gave [inheritance] unto the half tribe ofManasseh: and [this] was [the possession] of the half tribe of thechildren of Manasseh by their families. 

{13:30} And their coast wasfrom Mahanaim, all Bashan, all the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, andall the towns of Jair, which are in Bashan, threescore cities: 

{13:31}And half Gilead, and Ashtaroth, and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Ogin Bashan, [were pertaining] unto the children of Machir the son ofManasseh, even to the one half of the children of Machir by theirfamilies. 

{13:32} These [are the countries] which Moses did distributefor inheritance in the plains of Moab, on the other side Jordan, byJericho, eastward. 

{13:33} But unto the tribe of Levi Moses gave not[any] inheritance: the LORD God of Israel [was] their inheritance, ashe said unto them.   

{14:1} And these [are the countries] which the children of Israelinherited in the land of Canaan, which Eleazar the priest, and Joshuathe son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers of the tribes of thechildren of Israel, distributed for inheritance to them. 

{14:2} By lot[was] their inheritance, as the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses,for the nine tribes, and [for] the half tribe. 

{14:3} For Moses hadgiven the inheritance of two tribes and an half tribe on the other sideJordan: but unto the Levites he gave none inheritance among them.

{14:4} For the children of Joseph were two tribes, Manasseh andEphraim: therefore they gave no part unto the Levites in the land, savecities to dwell [in,] with their suburbs for their cattle and for theirsubstance. 

{14:5} As the LORD commanded Moses, so the children ofIsrael did, and they divided the land.   

{14:6} Then the children of Judah came unto Joshua in Gilgal: andCaleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite said unto him, Thou knowest thething that the LORD said unto Moses the man of God concerning me andthee in Kadesh-barnea. 

{14:7} Forty years old [was] I when Moses theservant of the LORD sent me from Kadesh-barnea to espy out the land;and I brought him word again as [it was] in mine heart. 

{14:8}Nevertheless my brethren that went up with me made the heart of thepeople melt: but I wholly followed the LORD my God. 

{14:9} And Mosessware on that day, saying, Surely the land whereon thy feet havetrodden shall be thine inheritance, and thy children's for ever,because thou hast wholly followed the LORD my God. 

{14:10} And now,behold, the LORD hath kept me alive, as he said, these forty and fiveyears, even since the LORD spake this word unto Moses, while [thechildren of] Israel wandered in the wilderness: and now, lo, I [am]this day fourscore and five years old. 

{14:11} As yet I [am as] strongthis day as [I was] in the day that Moses sent me: as my strength [was]then, even so [is] my strength now, for war, both to go out, and tocome in. 

{14:12} Now therefore give me this mountain, whereof the LORDspake in that day; for thou heardest in that day how the Anakims [were]there, and [that] the cities [were] great [and] fenced: if so be theLORD [will be] with me, then I shall be able to drive them out, as theLORD said. 

{14:13} And Joshua blessed him, and gave unto Caleb the sonof Jephunneh Hebron for an inheritance. 

{14:14} Hebron therefore becamethe inheritance of Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite unto thisday, because that he wholly followed the LORD God of Israel. 

{14:15}And the name of Hebron before [was] Kirjath-arba; [which Arba was] agreat man among the Anakims. And the land had rest from war.   

{15:1} [This] then was the lot of the tribe of the children of Judahby their families; [even] to the border of Edom the wilderness of Zinsouthward [was] the uttermost part of the south coast. 

{15:2} And theirsouth border was from the shore of the salt sea, from the bay thatlooketh southward: 

{15:3} And it went out to the south side toMaaleh-acrabbim, and passed along to Zin, and ascended up on the southside unto Kadesh-barnea, and passed along to Hezron, and went up toAdar, and fetched a compass to Karkaa: 

{15:4} [From thence] it passedtoward Azmon, and went out unto the river of Egypt; and the goings outof that coast were at the sea: this shall be your south coast. 

{15:5}And the east border [was] the salt sea, [even] unto the end of Jordan.And [their] border in the north quarter [was] from the bay of the seaat the uttermost part of Jordan: 

{15:6} And the border went up toBeth-hogla, and passed along by the north of Beth-arabah; and theborder went up to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben: 

{15:7} And theborder went up toward Debir from the valley of Achor, and so northward,looking toward Gilgal, [that is] before the going up to Adummim, which[is] on the south side of the river: and the border passed toward thewaters of En-shemesh, and the goings out thereof were at En-rogel:

{15:8} And the border went up by the valley of the son of Hinnom untothe south side of the Jebusite; the same [is] Jerusalem: and the borderwent up to the top of the mountain that [lieth] before the valley ofHinnom westward, which [is] at the end of the valley of the giantsnorthward: 

{15:9} And the border was drawn from the top of the hillunto the fountain of the water of Nephtoah, and went out to the citiesof mount Ephron; and the border was drawn to Baalah, which [is]Kirjath-jearim: 

{15:10} And the border compassed from Baalah westwardunto mount Seir, and passed along unto the side of mount Jearim, which[is] Chesalon, on the north side, and went down to Beth- shemesh, andpassed on to Timnah: 

{15:11} And the border went out unto the side ofEkron northward: and the border was drawn to Shicron, and passed alongto mount Baalah, and went out unto Jabneel; and the goings out of theborder were at the sea. 

{15:12} And the west border [was] to the greatsea, and the coast [thereof.] This [is] the coast of the children ofJudah round about according to their families.   

{15:13} And unto Caleb the son of Jephunneh he gave a part among thechildren of Judah, according to the commandment of the LORD to Joshua,[even] the city of Arba the father of Anak, which [city is] Hebron.

{15:14} And Caleb drove thence the three sons of Anak, Sheshai, andAhiman, and Talmai, the children of Anak. 

{15:15} And he went up thenceto the inhabitants of Debir: and the name of Debir before [was]Kirjath- sepher.   

{15:16} And Caleb said, He that smiteth Kirjath-sepher, and takethit, to him will I give Achsah my daughter to wife. 

{15:17} And Othnielthe son of Kenaz, the brother of Caleb, took it: and he gave him Achsahhis daughter to wife. 

{15:18} And it came to pass, as she came [untohim,] that she moved him to ask of her father a field: and she lightedoff [her] ass; and Caleb said unto her, What wouldest thou? 

{15:19} Whoanswered, Give me a blessing; for thou hast given me a south land; giveme also springs of water. And he gave her the upper springs, and thenether springs. 

{15:20} This [is] the inheritance of the tribe of thechildren of Judah according to their families. 

{15:21} And theuttermost cities of the tribe of the children of Judah toward the coastof Edom southward were Kabzeel, and Eder, and Jagur, 

{15:22} And Kinah,and Dimonah, and Adadah, 

{15:23} And Kedesh, and Hazor, and Ithnan,

{15:33} [And] in the valley, Eshtaol, and Zoreah, and Ashnah,

{15:34} And Zanoah, and En- gannim, Tappuah, and Enam, 

{15:35} Jarmuth,and Adullam, Socoh, and Azekah, 

{15:36} And Sharaim, and Adithaim, andGederah, and Gederothaim; fourteen cities with their villages:

{15:38} And Dilean, and Mizpeh,and Joktheel, 

{15:39} Lachish, and Bozkath, and Eglon, 

{15:40} AndCabbon, and Lahmam, and Kithlish, 

{15:41} And Gederoth, Beth-dagon, andNaamah, and Makkedah; sixteen cities with their villages: 

{15:42}Libnah, and Ether, and Ashan, 

{15:43} And Jiphtah, and Ashnah, andNezib, 

{15:44} And Keilah, and Achzib, and Mareshah; nine cities withtheir villages: 

{15:45} Ekron, with her towns and her villages: 

{15:46}From Ekron even unto the sea, all that [lay] near Ashdod, with theirvillages: 

{15:47} Ashdod with her towns and her villages, Gaza with hertowns and her villages, unto the river of Egypt, and the great sea, andthe border [thereof:]   

{15:48} And in the mountains, Shamir, and Jattir, and Socoh, 

{15:49}And Dannah, and Kirjath-sannah, which [is] Debir, 

{15:50} And Anab, andEshtemoh, and Anim, 

{15:51} And Goshen, and Holon, and Giloh; elevencities with their villages: 

{15:52} Arab, and Dumah, and Eshean,

{15:53} And Janum, and Beth-tappuah, and Aphekah, 

{15:54} And Humtah,and Kirjath-arba, which [is] Hebron, and Zior; nine cities with theirvillages: 

{15:55} Maon, Carmel, and Ziph, and Juttah, 

{15:56} AndJezreel, and Jokdeam, and Zanoah, 

{15:57} Cain, Gibeah, and Timnah; tencities with their villages: 

{15:58} Halhul, Beth-zur, and Gedor,

{15:59} And Maarath, and Beth-anoth, and Eltekon; six cities with theirvillages: 

{15:60} Kirjath- baal, which [is] Kirjath-jearim, and Rabbah;two cities with their villages: 

{15:61} In the wilderness, Beth-arabah,Middin, and Secacah, 

{15:62} And Nibshan, and the city of Salt, andEn-gedi; six cities with their villages. 

{15:63} As for the Jebusitesthe inhabitants of Jerusalem, the children of Judah could not drivethem out: but the Jebusites dwell with the children of Judah atJerusalem unto this day.   

{16:1} And the lot of the children of Joseph fell from Jordan byJericho, unto the water of Jericho on the east, to the wilderness thatgoeth up from Jericho throughout mount Bethel, 

{16:2} And goeth outfrom Bethel to Luz, and passeth along unto the borders of Archi toAtaroth, 

{16:3} And goeth down westward to the coast of Japhleti, untothe coast of Beth-horon the nether, and to Gezer: and the goings outthereof are at the sea. 

{16:4} So the children of Joseph, Manasseh andEphraim, took their inheritance.   

{16:5} And the border of the children of Ephraim according to theirfamilies was [thus:] even the border of their inheritance on the eastside was Ataroth-addar, unto Beth-horon the upper; 

{16:6} And theborder went out toward the sea to Michmethah on the north side; and theborder went about eastward unto Taanath-shiloh, and passed by it on theeast to Janohah; 

{16:7} And it went down from Janohah to Ataroth, andto Naarath, and came to Jericho, and went out at Jordan. 

{16:8} Theborder went out from Tappuah westward unto the river Kanah; and thegoings out thereof were at the sea. This [is] the inheritance of thetribe of the children of Ephraim by their families. 

{16:9} And theseparate cities for the children of Ephraim [were] among theinheritance of the children of Manasseh, all the cities with theirvillages. 

{16:10} And they drave not out the Canaanites that dwelt inGezer: but the Canaanites dwell among the Ephraimites unto this day,and serve under tribute.   

{17:1} There was also a lot for the tribe of Manasseh; for he [was]the firstborn of Joseph; [to wit,] for Machir the firstborn ofManasseh, the father of Gilead: because he was a man of war, thereforehe had Gilead and Bashan. 

{17:2} There was also [a lot] for the rest ofthe children of Manasseh by their families; for the children ofAbiezer, and for the children of Helek, and for the children of Asriel,and for the children of Shechem, and for the children of Hepher, andfor the children of Shemida: these [were] the male children of Manassehthe son of Joseph by their families.   

{17:3} But Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the sonof Machir, the son of Manasseh, had no sons, but daughters: and these[are] the names of his daughters, Mahlah, and Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, andTirzah. 

{17:4} And they came near before Eleazar the priest, and beforeJoshua the son of Nun, and before the princes, saying, The LORDcommanded Moses to give us an inheritance among our brethren. Thereforeaccording to the commandment of the LORD he gave them an inheritanceamong the brethren of their father. 

{17:5} And there fell ten portionsto Manasseh, beside the land of Gilead and Bashan, which [were] on theother side Jordan; 

{17:6} Because the daughters of Manasseh had aninheritance among his sons: and the rest of Manasseh's sons had theland of Gilead.   

{17:7} And the coast of Manasseh was from Asher to Michmethah, that[lieth] before Shechem; and the border went along on the right handunto the inhabitants of En- tappuah. 

{17:8} [Now] Manasseh had the landof Tappuah: but Tappuah on the border of Manasseh [belonged] to thechildren of Ephraim; 

{17:9} And the coast descended unto the riverKanah, southward of the river: these cities of Ephraim [are] among thecities of Manasseh: the coast of Manasseh also [was] on the north sideof the river, and the outgoings of it were at the sea: 

{17:10}Southward [it was] Ephraim's, and northward [it was] Manasseh's, andthe sea is his border; and they met together in Asher on the north, andin Issachar on the east. 

{17:11} And Manasseh had in Issachar and inAsher Beth-shean and her towns, and Ibleam and her towns, and theinhabitants of Dor and her towns, and the inhabitants of Endor and hertowns, and the inhabitants of Taanach and her towns, and theinhabitants of Megiddo and her towns, [even] three countries. 

{17:12}Yet the children of Manasseh could not drive out [the inhabitants of]those cities; but the Canaanites would dwell in that land. 

{17:13} Yetit came to pass, when the children of Israel were waxen strong, thatthey put the Canaanites to tribute; but did not utterly drive them out.

{17:14} And the children of Joseph spake unto Joshua, saying, Why hastthou given me [but] one lot and one portion to inherit, seeing I [am] agreat people, forasmuch as the LORD hath blessed me hitherto? 

{17:15}And Joshua answered them, If thou [be] a great people, [then] get theeup to the wood [country,] and cut down for thyself there in the land ofthe Perizzites and of the giants, if mount Ephraim be too narrow forthee. 

{17:16} And the children of Joseph said, The hill is not enoughfor us: and all the Canaanites that dwell in the land of the valleyhave chariots of iron, [both they] who [are] of Beth-shean and hertowns, and [they] who [are] of the valley of Jezreel. 

{17:17} AndJoshua spake unto the house of Joseph, [even] to Ephraim and toManasseh, saying, Thou [art] a great people, and hast great power: thoushalt not have one lot [only: ]

{17:18} But the mountain shall be thine;for it [is] a wood, and thou shalt cut it down: and the outgoings of itshall be thine: for thou shalt drive out the Canaanites, though theyhave iron chariots, [and] though they [be] strong.   

{18:1} And the whole congregation of the children of Israelassembled together at Shiloh, and set up the tabernacle of thecongregation there. And the land was subdued before them. 

{18:2} Andthere remained among the children of Israel seven tribes, which had notyet received their inheritance. 

{18:3} And Joshua said unto thechildren of Israel, How long [are] ye slack to go to possess the land,which the LORD God of your fathers hath given you? 

{18:4} Give out fromamong you three men for [each] tribe: and I will send them, and theyshall rise, and go through the land, and describe it according to theinheritance of them; and they shall come [again] to me. 

{18:5} And theyshall divide it into seven parts: Judah shall abide in their coast onthe south, and the house of Joseph shall abide in their coasts on thenorth. 

{18:6} Ye shall therefore describe the land [into] seven parts,and bring [the description] hither to me, that I may cast lots for youhere before the LORD our God. 

{18:7} But the Levites have no part amongyou; for the priesthood of the LORD is their inheritance: and Gad, andReuben, and half the tribe of Manasseh, have received their inheritancebeyond Jordan on the east, which Moses the servant of the LORD gavethem.   

{18:8} And the men arose, and went away: and Joshua charged themthat went to describe the land, saying, Go and walk through the land,and describe it, and come again to me, that I may here cast lots foryou before the LORD in Shiloh. 

{18:9} And the men went and passedthrough the land, and described it by cities into seven parts in abook, and came [again] to Joshua to the host at Shiloh.   

{18:10} And Joshua cast lots for them in Shiloh before the LORD: andthere Joshua divided the land unto the children of Israel according totheir divisions.   

{18:11} And the lot of the tribe of the children of Benjamin came upaccording to their families: and the coast of their lot came forthbetween the children of Judah and the children of Joseph. 

{18:12} Andtheir border on the north side was from Jordan; and the border went upto the side of Jericho on the north side, and went up through themountains westward; and the goings out thereof were at the wildernessof Beth-aven. 

{18:13} And the border went over from thence toward Luz,to the side of Luz, which is Bethel, southward; and the borderdescended to Ataroth-adar, near the hill that [lieth] on the south sideof the nether Beth-horon. 

{18:14} And the border was drawn [thence,]and compassed the corner of the sea southward, from the hill that[lieth] before Beth- horon southward; and the goings out thereof wereat Kirjath-baal, which [is] Kirjath- jearim, a city of the children ofJudah: this [was] the west quarter. 

{18:15} And the south quarter [was]from the end of Kirjath-jearim, and the border went out on the west,and went out to the well of waters of Nephtoah: 

{18:16} And the bordercame down to the end of the mountain that [lieth] before the valley ofthe son of Hinnom, [and] which [is] in the valley of the giants on thenorth, and descended to the valley of Hinnom, to the side of Jebusi onthe south, and descended to En-rogel, 

{18:17} And was drawn from thenorth, and went forth to En-shemesh, and went forth toward Geliloth,which [is] over against the going up of Adummim, and descended to thestone of Bohan the son of Reuben, 

{18:18} And passed along toward theside over against Arabah northward, and went down unto Arabah: 

{18:19}And the border passed along to the side of Beth-hoglah northward: andthe outgoings of the border were at the north bay of the salt sea atthe south end of Jordan: this [was] the south coast. 

{18:20} And Jordanwas the border of it on the east side. This [was] the inheritance ofthe children of Benjamin, by the coasts thereof round about, accordingto their families. 

{18:21} Now the cities of the tribe of the childrenof Benjamin according to their families were Jericho, and Beth-hoglah,and the valley of Keziz, 

{18:22} And Beth-arabah, and Zemaraim, andBethel, 

{18:23} And Avim, and Parah, and Ophrah, 

{18:24} AndChephar-haammonai, and Ophni, and Gaba; twelve cities with theirvillages: 

{18:25} Gibeon, and Ramah, and Beeroth, 

{18:26} And Mizpeh,and Chephirah, and Mozah, 

{18:27} And Rekem, and Irpeel, and Taralah,

{18:28} And Zelah, Eleph, and Jebusi, which [is] Jerusalem, Gibeath,[and] Kirjath; fourteen cities with their villages. This [is] theinheritance of the children of Benjamin according to their families.   

{19:1} And the second lot came forth to Simeon, [even] for the tribeof the children of Simeon according to their families: and theirinheritance was within the inheritance of the children of Judah. 

{19:2}And they had in their inheritance Beer-sheba, or Sheba, and Moladah,

{19:3} And Hazar-shual, and Balah, and Azem, 

{19:4} And Eltolad, andBethul, and Hormah, 

{19:5} And Ziklag, and Beth-marcaboth, andHazar-susah, 

{19:6} And Beth-lebaoth, and Sharuhen; thirteen cities andtheir villages: 

{19:7} Ain, Remmon, and Ether, and Ashan; four citiesand their villages: 

{19:8} And all the villages that [were] round aboutthese cities to Baalath-beer, Ramath of the south. This is theinheritance of the tribe of the children of Simeon according to theirfamilies. 

{19:9} Out of the portion of the children of Judah [was] theinheritance of the children of Simeon: for the part of the children ofJudah was too much for them: therefore the children of Simeon had theirinheritance within the inheritance of them.   

{19:10} And the third lot came up for the children of Zebulunaccording to their families: and the border of their inheritance wasunto Sarid: 

{19:11} And their border went up toward the sea, andMaralah, and reached to Dabbasheth, and reached to the river that [is]before Jokneam; 

{19:12} And turned from Sarid eastward toward thesunrising unto the border of Chisloth-tabor, and then goeth out todaberath, and goeth up to Japhia, 

{19:13} And from thence passeth onalong on the east to Gittah-hepher, to Ittah-kazin, and goeth out toRemmon-methoar to Neah; 

{19:14} And the border compasseth it on thenorth side to Hannathon: and the outgoings thereof are in the valley ofJiphthah-el: 

{19:15} And Kattath, and Nahallal, and Shimron, andIdalah, and Bethlehem: twelve cities with their villages. 

{19:16} Thisis the inheritance of the children of Zebulun according to theirfamilies, these cities with their villages.   

{19:17} [And] the fourth lot came out to Issachar, for the childrenof Issachar according to their families. 

{19:18} And their border wastoward Jezreel, and Chesulloth, and Shunem,

{19:20} And Rabbith, and Kishion, and Abez,

{19:21} And Remeth, and En-gannim, and En-haddah, and Beth-pazzez;

{19:22} And the coast reacheth to Tabor, and Shahazimah, andBeth-shemesh; and the outgoings of their border were at Jordan: sixteencities with their villages. 

{19:23} This is the inheritance of thetribe of the children of Issachar according to their families, thecities and their villages.   

{19:24} And the fifth lot came out for the tribe of the children ofAsher according to their families. 

{19:25} And their border wasHelkath, and Hali, and Beten, and Achshaph, 

{19:26} And Alammelech, andAmad, and Misheal; and reacheth to Carmel westward, and to Shihor-libnath; 

{19:27} And turneth toward the sunrising to Beth-dagon, andreacheth to Zebulun, and to the valley of Jiphthah-el toward the northside of Beth-emek, and Neiel, and goeth out to Cabul on the left hand,

{19:28} And Hebron, and Rehob, and Hammon, and Kanah, [even] unto greatZidon; 

{19:29} And [then] the coast turneth to Ramah, and to the strongcity Tyre; and the coast turneth to Hosah; and the outgoings thereofare at the sea from the coast to Achzib: 

{19:30} Ummah also, and Aphek,and Rehob: twenty and two cities with their villages. 

{19:31} This [is]the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Asher according totheir families, these cities with their villages.   

{19:32} The sixth lot came out to the children of Naphtali, [even]for the children of Naphtali according to their families. 

{19:33} Andtheir coast was from Heleph, from Allon to Zaanannim, and Adami, Nekeb,and Jabneel, unto Lakum; and the outgoings thereof were at Jordan:

{19:34} And [then] the coast turneth westward to Aznoth-tabor, andgoeth out from thence to Hukkok, and reacheth to Zebulun on the southside, and reacheth to Asher on the west side, and to Judah upon Jordantoward the sunrising. 

{19:35} And the fenced cities [are] Ziddim, Zer,and Hammath, Rakkath, and Chinnereth, 

{19:36} And Adamah, and Ramah,and Hazor, 

{19:37} And Kedesh, and Edrei, and En-hazor,

{19:45} AndJehud, and Bene- berak, and Gath-rimmon, 

{19:46} And Me-jarkon, andRakkon, with the border before Japho. 

{19:47} And the coast of thechildren of Dan went out [too little] for them: therefore the childrenof Dan went up to fight against Leshem, and took it, and smote it withthe edge of the sword, and possessed it, and dwelt therein, and calledLeshem, Dan, after the name of Dan their father. 

{19:48} This [is] theinheritance of the tribe of the children of Dan according to theirfamilies, these cities with their villages.   

{19:49} When they had made an end of dividing the land forinheritance by their coasts, the children of Israel gave an inheritanceto Joshua the son of Nun among them: 

{19:50} According to the word ofthe LORD they gave him the city which he asked, [even] Timnath-serah inmount Ephraim: and he built the city, and dwelt therein. 

{19:51} These[are] the inheritances which Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son ofNun, and the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the children ofIsrael, divided for an inheritance by lot in Shiloh before the LORD, atthe door of the tabernacle of the congregation. So they made an end ofdividing the country.   

{20:1} The LORD also spake unto Joshua, saying, 

{20:2} Speak to thechildren of Israel, saying, Appoint out for you cities of refuge,whereof I spake unto you by the hand of Moses: 

{20:3} That the slayerthat killeth [any] person unawares [and] unwittingly may flee thither:and they shall be your refuge from the avenger of blood. 

{20:4} Andwhen he that doth flee unto one of those cities shall stand at theentering of the gate of the city, and shall declare his cause in theears of the elders of that city, they shall take him into the city untothem, and give him a place, that he may dwell among them. 

{20:5} And ifthe avenger of blood pursue after him, then they shall not deliver theslayer up into his hand; because he smote his neighbour unwittingly,and hated him not beforetime. 

{20:6} And he shall dwell in that city,until he stand before the congregation for judgment, [and] until thedeath of the high priest that shall be in those days: then shall theslayer return, and come unto his own city, and unto his own house, untothe city from whence he fled.   

{20:7} And they appointed Kedesh in Galilee in mount Naphtali, andShechem in mount Ephraim, and Kirjath-arba, which [is] Hebron, in themountain of Judah. 

{20:8} And on the other side Jordan by Jerichoeastward, they assigned Bezer in the wilderness upon the plain out ofthe tribe of Reuben, and Ramoth in Gilead out of the tribe of Gad, andGolan in Bashan out of the tribe of Manasseh. 

{20:9} These were thecities appointed for all the children of Israel, and for the strangerthat sojourneth among them, that whosoever killeth [any] person atunawares might flee thither, and not die by the hand of the avenger ofblood, until he stood before the congregation.   

{21:1} Then came near the heads of the fathers of the Levites untoEleazar the priest, and unto Joshua the son of Nun, and unto the headsof the fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel; 

{21:2} And theyspake unto them at Shiloh in the land of Canaan, saying, The LORDcommanded by the hand of Moses to give us cities to dwell in, with thesuburbs thereof for our cattle. 

{21:3} And the children of Israel gaveunto the Levites out of their inheritance, at the commandment of theLORD, these cities and their suburbs. 

{21:4} And the lot came out forthe families of the Kohathites: and the children of Aaron the priest,[which were] of the Levites, had by lot out of the tribe of Judah, andout of the tribe of Simeon, and out of the tribe of Benjamin, thirteencities. 

{21:5} And the rest of the children of Kohath [had] by lot outof the families of the tribe of Ephraim, and out of the tribe of Dan,and out of the half tribe of Manasseh, ten cities. 

{21:6} And thechildren of Gershon [had] by lot out of the families of the tribe ofIssachar, and out of the tribe of Asher, and out of the tribe ofNaphtali, and out of the half tribe of Manasseh in Bashan, thirteencities. 

{21:7} The children of Merari by their families [had] out ofthe tribe of Reuben, and out of the tribe of Gad, and out of the tribeof Zebulun, twelve cities. 

{21:8} And the children of Israel gave bylot unto the Levites these cities with their suburbs, as the LORDcommanded by the hand of Moses.   

{21:9} And they gave out of the tribe of the children of Judah, andout of the tribe of the children of Simeon, these cities which are[here] mentioned by name, 

{21:10} Which the children of Aaron, [being]of the families of the Kohathites, [who were] of the children of Levi,had: for theirs was the first lot. 

{21:11} And they gave them the cityof Arba the father of Anak, which [city is] Hebron, in the hill[country] of Judah, with the suburbs thereof round about it. 

{21:12}But the fields of the city, and the villages thereof, gave they toCaleb the son of Jephunneh for his possession.   

{21:13} Thus they gave to the children of Aaron the priest Hebronwith her suburbs, [to be] a city of refuge for the slayer; and Libnahwith her suburbs, 

{21:14} And Jattir with her suburbs, and Eshtemoawith her suburbs, 

{21:15} And Holon with her suburbs, and Debir withher suburbs, 

{21:16} And Ain with her suburbs, and Juttah with hersuburbs, [and] Beth-shemesh with her suburbs; nine cities out of thosetwo tribes. 

{21:17} And out of the tribe of Benjamin, Gibeon with hersuburbs, Geba with her suburbs, 

{21:18} Anathoth with her suburbs, andAlmon with her suburbs; four cities. 

{21:19} All the cities of thechildren of Aaron, the priests, [were] thirteen cities with theirsuburbs.   

{21:20} And the families of the children of Kohath, the Leviteswhich remained of the children of Kohath, even they had the cities oftheir lot out of the tribe of Ephraim. 

{21:21} For they gave themShechem with her suburbs in mount Ephraim, [to be] a city of refuge forthe slayer; and Gezer with her suburbs, 

{21:22} And Kibzaim with hersuburbs, and Beth-horon with her suburbs; four cities. 

{21:23} And outof the tribe of Dan, Eltekeh with her suburbs, Gibbethon with hersuburbs, 

{21:24} Aijalon with her suburbs, Gath- rimmon with hersuburbs; four cities. 

{21:25} And out of the half tribe of Manasseh,Tanach with her suburbs, and Gath-rimmon with her suburbs; two cities.

{21:26} All the cities [were] ten with their suburbs for the familiesof the children of Kohath that remained.   

{21:27} And unto the children of Gershon, of the families of theLevites, out of the [other] half tribe of Manasseh [they gave] Golan inBashan with her suburbs, [to be] a city of refuge for the slayer; andBeesh-terah with her suburbs; two cities. 

{21:28} And out of the tribeof Issachar, Kishon with her suburbs, Dabareh with her suburbs, 

{21:29}Jarmuth with her suburbs, En-gannim with her suburbs; four cities.

{21:30} And out of the tribe of Asher, Mishal with her suburbs, Abdonwith her suburbs, 

{21:31} Helkath with her suburbs, and Rehob with hersuburbs; four cities. 

{21:32} And out of the tribe of Naphtali, Kedeshin Galilee with her suburbs, [to be] a city of refuge for the slayer;and Hammoth-dor with her suburbs, and Kartan with her suburbs; threecities. 

{21:33} All the cities of the Gershonites according to theirfamilies [were] thirteen cities with their suburbs.   

{21:34} And unto the families of the children of Merari, the rest ofthe Levites, out of the tribe of Zebulun, Jokneam with her suburbs, andKartah with her suburbs, 

{21:35} Dimnah with her suburbs, Nahalal withher suburbs; four cities. 

{21:36} And out of the tribe of Reuben, Bezerwith her suburbs, and Jahazah with her suburbs, 

{21:37} Kedemoth withher suburbs, and Mephaath with her suburbs; four cities. 

{21:38} Andout of the tribe of Gad, Ramoth in Gilead with her suburbs, [to be] acity of refuge for the slayer; and Mahanaim with her suburbs, 

{21:39}Heshbon with her suburbs, Jazer with her suburbs; four cities in all.

{21:40} So all the cities for the children of Merari by their families,which were remaining of the families of the Levites, were by their lottwelve cities. 

{21:41} All the cities of the Levites within thepossession of the children of Israel [were] forty and eight cities withtheir suburbs. 

{21:42} These cities were every one with their suburbsround about them: thus [were] all these cities.   

{21:43} And the LORD gave unto Israel all the land which he sware togive unto their fathers; and they possessed it, and dwelt therein.

{21:44} And the LORD gave them rest round about, according to all thathe sware unto their fathers: and there stood not a man of all theirenemies before them; the LORD delivered all their enemies into theirhand. 

{21:45} There failed not ought of any good thing which the LORDhad spoken unto the house of Israel; all came to pass. 

{22:1} ThenJoshua called the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half tribe ofManasseh, 

{22:2} And said unto them, Ye have kept all that Moses theservant of the LORD commanded you, and have obeyed my voice in all thatI commanded you: 

{22:3} Ye have not left your brethren these many daysunto this day, but have kept the charge of the commandment of the LORDyour God. 

{22:4} And now the LORD your God hath given rest unto yourbrethren, as he promised them: therefore now return ye, and get youunto your tents, [and] unto the land of your possession, which Mosesthe servant of the LORD gave you on the other side Jordan. 

{22:5} Buttake diligent heed to do the commandment and the law, which Moses theservant of the LORD charged you, to love the LORD your God, and to walkin all his ways, and to keep his commandments, and to cleave unto him,and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul. 

{22:6} SoJoshua blessed them, and sent them away: and they went unto their tents.   

{22:7} Now to the [one] half of the tribe of Manasseh Moses hadgiven [possession] in Bashan: but unto the [other] half thereof gaveJoshua among their brethren on this side Jordan westward. And whenJoshua sent them away also unto their tents, then he blessed them,

{22:8} And he spake unto them, saying, Return with much riches untoyour tents, and with very much cattle, with silver, and with gold, andwith brass, and with iron, and with very much raiment: divide the spoilof your enemies with your brethren.   

{22:9} And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and thehalf tribe of Manasseh returned, and departed from the children ofIsrael out of Shiloh, which [is] in the land of Canaan, to go unto thecountry of Gilead, to the land of their possession, whereof they werepossessed, according to the word of the LORD by the hand of Moses.   

{22:10} And when they came unto the borders of Jordan, that [are] inthe land of Canaan, the children of Reuben and the children of Gad andthe half tribe of Manasseh built there an altar by Jordan, a greataltar to see to.   

{22:11} And the children of Israel heard say, Behold, the childrenof Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh havebuilt an altar over against the land of Canaan, in the borders ofJordan, at the passage of the children of Israel. 

{22:12} And when thechildren of Israel heard [of it,] the whole congregation of thechildren of Israel gathered themselves together at Shiloh, to go up towar against them. 

{22:13} And the children of Israel sent unto thechildren of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the half tribeof Manasseh, into the land of Gilead, Phinehas the son of Eleazar thepriest, 

{22:14} And with him ten princes, of each chief house a princethroughout all the tribes of Israel; and each one [was] an head of thehouse of their fathers among the thousands of Israel.   

{22:15} And they came unto the children of Reuben, and to thechildren of Gad, and to the half tribe of Manasseh, unto the land ofGilead, and they spake with them, saying, 

{22:16} Thus saith the wholecongregation of the LORD, What trespass [is] this that ye havecommitted against the God of Israel, to turn away this day fromfollowing the LORD, in that ye have builded you an altar, that ye mightrebel this day against the LORD? 

{22:17} [Is] the iniquity of Peor toolittle for us, from which we are not cleansed until this day, althoughthere was a plague in the congregation of the LORD, 

{22:18} But that yemust turn away this day from following the LORD? and it will be,[seeing] ye rebel to day against the LORD, that to morrow he will bewroth with the whole congregation of Israel. 

{22:19} Notwithstanding,if the land of your possession [be] unclean, [then] pass ye over untothe land of the possession of the LORD, wherein the LORD'S tabernacledwelleth, and take possession among us: but rebel not against the LORD,nor rebel against us, in building you an altar beside the altar of theLORD our God. 

{22:20} Did not Achan the son of Zerah commit a trespassin the accursed thing, and wrath fell on all the congregation ofIsrael? and that man perished not alone in his iniquity.   

{22:21} Then the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and thehalf tribe of Manasseh answered, and said unto the heads of thethousands of Israel, 

{22:22} The LORD God of gods, the LORD God ofgods, he knoweth, and Israel he shall know; if [it be] in rebellion, orif in transgression against the LORD, (save us not this day,) 

{22:23}That we have built us an altar to turn from following the LORD, or ifto offer thereon burnt offering or meat offering, or if to offer peaceofferings thereon, let the LORD himself require it; 

{22:24} And if wehave not [rather] done it for fear of [this] thing, saying, In time tocome your children might speak unto our children, saying, What have yeto do with the LORD God of Israel? 

{22:25} For the LORD hath madeJordan a border between us and you, ye children of Reuben and childrenof Gad; ye have no part in the LORD: so shall your children make ourchildren cease from fearing the LORD. 

{22:26} Therefore we said, Let usnow prepare to build us an altar, not for burnt offering, nor forsacrifice: 

{22:27} But [that] it [may be] a witness between us, andyou, and our generations after us, that we might do the service of theLORD before him with our burnt offerings, and with our sacrifices, andwith our peace offerings; that your children may not say to ourchildren in time to come, Ye have no part in the LORD. 

{22:28}Therefore said we, that it shall be, when they should so say to us orto our generations in time to come, that we may say [again,] Behold thepattern of the altar of the LORD, which our fathers made, not for burntofferings, nor for sacrifices; but it [is] a witness between us andyou. 

{22:29} God forbid that we should rebel against the LORD, and turnthis day from following the LORD, to build an altar for burntofferings, for meat offerings, or for sacrifices, beside the altar ofthe LORD our God that [is] before his tabernacle.   

{22:30} And when Phinehas the priest, and the princes of thecongregation and heads of the thousands of Israel which [were] withhim, heard the words that the children of Reuben and the children ofGad and the children of Manasseh spake, it pleased them. 

{22:31} AndPhinehas the son of Eleazar the priest said unto the children ofReuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the children of Manasseh,This day we perceive that the LORD [is] among us, because ye have notcommitted this trespass against the LORD: now ye have delivered thechildren of Israel out of the hand of the LORD.   

{22:32} And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, and the princes,returned from the children of Reuben, and from the children of Gad, outof the land of Gilead, unto the land of Canaan, to the children ofIsrael, and brought them word again. 

{22:33} And the thing pleased thechildren of Israel; and the children of Israel blessed God, and did notintend to go up against them in battle, to destroy the land wherein thechildren of Reuben and Gad dwelt. 

{22:34} And the children of Reubenand the children of Gad called the altar [Ed:] for it [shall be] awitness between us that the LORD [is] God.   

{23:1} And it came to pass a long time after that the LORD had givenrest unto Israel from all their enemies round about, that Joshua waxedold [and] stricken in age. 

{23:2} And Joshua called for all Israel,[and] for their elders, and for their heads, and for their judges, andfor their officers, and said unto them, I am old [and] stricken in age:

{23:3} And ye have seen all that the LORD your God hath done unto allthese nations because of you; for the LORD your God [is] he that hathfought for you. 

{23:4} Behold, I have divided unto you by lot thesenations that remain, to be an inheritance for your tribes, from Jordan,with all the nations that I have cut off, even unto the great seawestward. 

{23:5} And the LORD your God, he shall expel them from beforeyou, and drive them from out of your sight; and ye shall possess theirland, as the LORD your God hath promised unto you. 

{23:6} Be yetherefore very courageous to keep and to do all that is written in thebook of the law of Moses, that ye turn not aside therefrom [to] theright hand or [to] the left; 

{23:7} That ye come not among thesenations, these that remain among you; neither make mention of the namesof their gods, nor cause to swear [by them,] neither serve them, norbow yourselves unto them: 

{23:8} But cleave unto the LORD your God, asye have done unto this day. 

{23:9} For the LORD hath driven out frombefore you great nations and strong: but [as for] you, no man hath beenable to stand before you unto this day. 

{23:10} One man of you shallchase a thousand: for the LORD your God, he [it is] that fighteth foryou, as he hath promised you. 

{23:11} Take good heed therefore untoyourselves, that ye love the LORD your God. 

{23:12} Else if ye do inany wise go back, and cleave unto the remnant of these nations, [even]these that remain among you, and shall make marriages with them, and goin unto them, and they to you: 

{23:13} Know for a certainty that theLORD your God will no more drive out [any of] these nations from beforeyou; but they shall be snares and traps unto you, and scourges in yoursides, and thorns in your eyes, until ye perish from off this good landwhich the LORD your God hath given you. 

{23:14} And, behold, this day I[am] going the way of all the earth: and ye know in all your hearts andin all your souls, that not one thing hath failed of all the goodthings which the LORD your God spake concerning you; all are come topass unto you, [and] not one thing hath failed thereof. 

{23:15}Therefore it shall come to pass, [that] as all good things are comeupon you, which the LORD your God promised you; so shall the LORD bringupon you all evil things, until he have destroyed you from off thisgood land which the LORD your God hath given you. 

{23:16} When ye havetransgressed the covenant of the LORD your God, which he commanded you,and have gone and served other gods, and bowed yourselves to them; thenshall the anger of the LORD be kindled against you, and ye shall perishquickly from off the good land which he hath given unto you.   

{24:1} And Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to Shechem, andcalled for the elders of Israel, and for their heads, and for theirjudges, and for their officers; and they presented themselves beforeGod. 

{24:2} And Joshua said unto all the people, Thus saith the LORDGod of Israel, Your fathers dwelt on the other side of the flood in oldtime, [even] Terah, the father of Abraham, and the father of Nachor:and they served other gods. 

{24:3} And I took your father Abraham fromthe other side of the flood, and led him throughout all the land ofCanaan, and multiplied his seed, and gave him Isaac. 

{24:4} And I gaveunto Isaac Jacob and Esau: and I gave unto Esau mount Seir, to possessit; but Jacob and his children went down into Egypt. 

{24:5} I sentMoses also and Aaron, and I plagued Egypt, according to that which Idid among them: and afterward I brought you out. 

{24:6} And I broughtyour fathers out of Egypt: and ye came unto the sea; and the Egyptianspursued after your fathers with chariots and horsemen unto the Red sea.

{24:7} And when they cried unto the LORD, he put darkness between youand the Egyptians, and brought the sea upon them, and covered them; andyour eyes have seen what I have done in Egypt: and ye dwelt in thewilderness a long season. 

{24:8} And I brought you into the land of theAmorites, which dwelt on the other side Jordan; and they fought withyou: and I gave them into your hand, that ye might possess their land;and I destroyed them from before you. 

{24:9} Then Balak the son ofZippor, king of Moab, arose and warred against Israel, and sent andcalled Balaam the son of Beor to curse you: 

{24:10} But I would nothearken unto Balaam; therefore he blessed you still: so I delivered youout of his hand. 

{24:11} And ye went over Jordan, and came untoJericho: and the men of Jericho fought against you, the Amorites, andthe Perizzites, and the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and theGirgashites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites; and I delivered them intoyour hand. 

{24:12} And I sent the hornet before you, which drave themout from before you, [even] the two kings of the Amorites; [but] notwith thy sword, nor with thy bow. 

{24:13} And I have given you a landfor which ye did not labour, and cities which ye built not, and yedwell in them; of the vineyards and oliveyards which ye planted not doye eat.   

{24:14} Now therefore fear the LORD, and serve him in sincerity andin truth: and put away the gods which your fathers served on the otherside of the flood, and in Egypt; and serve ye the LORD. 

{24:15} And ifit seem evil unto you to serve the LORD, choose you this day whom yewill serve; whether the gods which your fathers served that [were] onthe other side of the flood, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose landye dwell: but as for me and my house, we will serve the LORD. 

{24:16}And the people answered and said, God forbid that we should forsake theLORD, to serve other gods; 

{24:17} For the LORD our God, he [it is]that brought us up and our fathers out of the land of Egypt, from thehouse of bondage, and which did those great signs in our sight, andpreserved us in all the way wherein we went, and among all the peoplethrough whom we passed: 

{24:18} And the LORD drave out from before usall the people, even the Amorites which dwelt in the land: [therefore]will we also serve the LORD; for he [is] our God. 

{24:19} And Joshuasaid unto the people, Ye cannot serve the LORD: for he [is] an holyGod; he [is] a jealous God; he will not forgive your transgressions noryour sins. 

{24:20} If ye forsake the LORD, and serve strange gods, thenhe will turn and do you hurt, and consume you, after that he hath doneyou good. 

{24:21} And the people said unto Joshua, Nay; but we willserve the LORD. 

{24:22} And Joshua said unto the people, Ye [are]witnesses against yourselves that ye have chosen you the LORD, to servehim. And they said, [We are] witnesses. 

{24:23} Now therefore put away,[said he,] the strange gods which [are] among you, and incline yourheart unto the LORD God of Israel. 

{24:24} And the people said untoJoshua, The LORD our God will we serve, and his voice will we obey.

{24:25} So Joshua made a covenant with the people that day, and setthem a statute and an ordinance in Shechem.   

{24:26} And Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of God,and took a great stone, and set it up there under an oak, that [was] bythe sanctuary of the LORD. 

{24:27} And Joshua said unto all the people,Behold, this stone shall be a witness unto us; for it hath heard allthe words of the LORD which he spake unto us: it shall be therefore awitness unto you, lest ye deny your God. 

{24:28} So Joshua let thepeople depart, every man unto his inheritance.   

{24:29} And it came to pass after these things, that Joshua the sonof Nun, the servant of the LORD, died, [being] an hundred and ten yearsold. 

{24:30} And they buried him in the border of his inheritance inTimnath-serah, which [is] in mount Ephraim, on the north side of thehill of Gaash. 

{24:31} And Israel served the LORD all the days ofJoshua, and all the days of the elders that overlived Joshua, and whichhad known all the works of the LORD, that he had done for Israel.   

{24:32} And the bones of Joseph, which the children of Israelbrought up out of Egypt, buried they in Shechem, in a parcel of groundwhich Jacob bought of the sons of Hamor the father of Shechem for anhundred pieces of silver: and it became the inheritance of the childrenof Joseph. 

{24:33} And Eleazar the son of Aaron died; and they buriedhim in a hill [that pertained to] Phinehas his son, which was given himin mount Ephraim.
