{Amos   

{1:1} The words of Amos, who was among the herdmen of Tekoa, whichhe saw concerning Israel in the days of Uzziah king of Judah, and inthe days of Jeroboam the son of Joash king of Israel, two years beforethe earthquake. 

{1:2} And he said, The LORD will roar from Zion, andutter his voice from Jerusalem; and the habitations of the shepherdsshall mourn, and the top of Carmel shall wither. 

{1:3} Thus saith theLORD; For three transgressions of Damascus, and for four, I will notturn away [the punishment] thereof; because they have threshed Gileadwith threshing instruments of iron: 

{1:4} But I will send a fire intothe house of Hazael, which shall devour the palaces of Ben-hadad. 

{1:5}I will break also the bar of Damascus, and cut off the inhabitant fromthe plain of Aven, and him that holdeth the sceptre from the house ofEden: and the people of Syria shall go into captivity unto Kir, saiththe LORD.   

{1:6} Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Gaza, and forfour, I will not turn away [the punishment] thereof; because theycarried away captive the whole captivity, to deliver [them] up to Edom:

{1:7} But I will send a fire on the wall of Gaza, which shall devourthe palaces thereof: 

{1:8} And I will cut off the inhabitant fromAshdod, and him that holdeth the sceptre from Ashkelon, and I will turnmine hand against Ekron: and the remnant of the Philistines shallperish, saith the Lord GOD.   

{1:9} Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Tyrus, andfor four, I will not turn away [the punishment] thereof; because theydelivered up the whole captivity to Edom, and remembered not thebrotherly covenant: 

{1:10} But I will send a fire on the wall of Tyrus,which shall devour the palaces thereof.   

{1:11} Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Edom, andfor four, I will not turn away [the punishment] thereof; because he didpursue his brother with the sword, and did cast off all pity, and hisanger did tear perpetually, and he kept his wrath for ever: 

{1:12} ButI will send a fire upon Teman, which shall devour the palaces of Bozrah.   

{1:13} Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of the childrenof Ammon, and for four, I will not turn away [the punishment] thereof;because they have ripped up the women with child of Gilead, that theymight enlarge their border: 

{1:14} But I will kindle a fire in the wallof Rabbah, and it shall devour the palaces thereof, with shouting inthe day of battle, with a tempest in the day of the whirlwind: 

{1:15}And their king shall go into captivity, he and his princes together,saith the LORD.   

{2:1} Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Moab, and forfour, I will not turn away [the punishment] thereof; because he burnedthe bones of the king of Edom into lime: 

{2:2} But I will send a fireupon Moab, and it shall devour the palaces of Kirioth: and Moab shalldie with tumult, with shouting, [and] with the sound of the trumpet:

{2:3} And I will cut off the judge from the midst thereof, and willslay all the princes thereof with him, saith the LORD.   

{2:4} Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Judah, andfor four, I will not turn away [the punishment] thereof; because theyhave despised the law of the LORD, and have not kept his commandments,and their lies caused them to err, after the which their fathers havewalked: 

{2:5} But I will send a fire upon Judah, and it shall devourthe palaces of Jerusalem.   

{2:6} Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Israel, andfor four, I will not turn away [the punishment] thereof; because theysold the righteous for silver, and the poor for a pair of shoes; 

{2:7}That pant after the dust of the earth on the head of the poor, and turnaside the way of the meek: and a man and his father will go in unto the[same] maid, to profane my holy name: 

{2:8} And they lay [themselves]down upon clothes laid to pledge by every altar, and they drink thewine of the condemned in the house of their god.   

{2:9} Yet destroyed I the Amorite before them, whose height [was]like the height of the cedars, and he [was] strong as the oaks; yet Idestroyed his fruit from above, and his roots from beneath. 

{2:10} AlsoI brought you up from the land of Egypt, and led you forty yearsthrough the wilderness, to possess the land of the Amorite. 

{2:11} AndI raised up of your sons for prophets, and of your young men forNazarites. [Is it] not even thus, O ye children of Israel? saith theLORD. 

{2:12} But ye gave the Nazarites wine to drink; and commanded theprophets, saying, Prophesy not. 

{2:13} Behold, I am pressed under you,as a cart is pressed [that is] full of sheaves. 

{2:14} Therefore theflight shall perish from the swift, and the strong shall not strengthenhis force, neither shall the mighty deliver himself: 

{2:15} Neithershall he stand that handleth the bow; and [he that is] swift of footshall not deliver [himself:] neither shall he that rideth the horsedeliver himself. 

{2:16} And [he that is] courageous among the mightyshall flee away naked in that day, saith the LORD.   

{3:1} Hear this word that the LORD hath spoken against you, Ochildren of Israel, against the whole family which I brought up fromthe land of Egypt, saying, 

{3:2} You only have I known of all thefamilies of the earth: therefore I will punish you for all youriniquities. 

{3:3} Can two walk together, except they be agreed? 

{3:4}Will a lion roar in the forest, when he hath no prey? will a young lioncry out of his den, if he have taken nothing? 

{3:5} Can a bird fall ina snare upon the earth, where no gin [is] for him? shall [one] take upa snare from the earth, and have taken nothing at all? 

{3:6} Shall atrumpet be blown in the city, and the people not be afraid? shall therebe evil in a city, and the LORD hath not done [it? ]

{3:7} Surely theLord GOD will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto his servantsthe prophets. 

{3:8} The lion hath roared, who will not fear? the LordGOD hath spoken, who can but prophesy?   

{3:9} Publish in the palaces at Ashdod, and in the palaces in theland of Egypt, and say, Assemble yourselves upon the mountains ofSamaria, and behold the great tumults in the midst thereof, and theoppressed in the midst thereof. 

{3:10} For they know not to do right,saith the LORD, who store up violence and robbery in their palaces.

{3:11} Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; An adversary [there shall be]even round about the land; and he shall bring down thy strength fromthee, and thy palaces shall be spoiled. 

{3:12} Thus saith the LORD; Asthe shepherd taketh out of the mouth of the lion two legs, or a pieceof an ear; so shall the children of Israel be taken out that dwell inSamaria in the corner of a bed, and in Damascus [in] a couch. 

{3:13}Hear ye, and testify in the house of Jacob, saith the Lord GOD, the Godof hosts, 

{3:14} That in the day that I shall visit the transgressionsof Israel upon him I will also visit the altars of Bethel: and thehorns of the altar shall be cut off, and fall to the ground. 

{3:15} AndI will smite the winter house with the summer house; and the houses ofivory shall perish, and the great houses shall have an end, saith theLORD.   

{4:1} Hear this word, ye kine of Bashan, that [are] in the mountainof Samaria, which oppress the poor, which crush the needy, which say totheir masters, Bring, and let us drink. 

{4:2} The Lord GOD hath swornby his holiness, that, lo, the days shall come upon you, that he willtake you away with hooks, and your posterity with fishhooks. 

{4:3} Andye shall go out at the breaches, every [cow at that which is] beforeher; and ye shall cast [them] into the palace, saith the LORD.   

{4:4} Come to Bethel, and transgress; at Gilgal multiplytransgression; and bring your sacrifices every morning, [and] yourtithes after three years: 

{4:5} And offer a sacrifice of thanksgivingwith leaven, and proclaim [and] publish the free offerings: for thisliketh you, O ye children of Israel, saith the Lord GOD.   

{4:6} And I also have given you cleanness of teeth in all yourcities, and want of bread in all your places: yet have ye not returnedunto me, saith the LORD. 

{4:7} And also I have withholden the rain fromyou, when [there were] yet three months to the harvest: and I caused itto rain upon one city, and caused it not to rain upon another city: onepiece was rained upon, and the piece whereupon it rained not withered.

{4:8} So two [or] three cities wandered unto one city, to drink water;but they were not satisfied: yet have ye not returned unto me, saiththe LORD. 

{4:9} I have smitten you with blasting and mildew: when yourgardens and your vineyards and your fig trees and your olive treesincreased, the palmerworm devoured [them:] yet have ye not returnedunto me, saith the LORD. 

{4:10} I have sent among you the pestilenceafter the manner of Egypt: your young men have I slain with the sword,and have taken away your horses; and I have made the stink of yourcamps to come up unto your nostrils: yet have ye not returned unto me,saith the LORD. 

{4:11} I have overthrown [some] of you, as Godoverthrew Sodom and Gomorrah, and ye were as a firebrand plucked out ofthe burning: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the LORD. 

{4:12}Therefore thus will I do unto thee, O Israel: [and] because I will dothis unto thee, prepare to meet thy God, O Israel. 

{4:13} For, lo, hethat formeth the mountains, and createth the wind, and declareth untoman what [is] his thought, that maketh the morning darkness, andtreadeth upon the high places of the earth, The LORD, The God of hosts,[is] his name.   

{5:1} Hear ye this word which I take up against you, [even] alamentation, O house of Israel. 

{5:2} The virgin of Israel is fallen;she shall no more rise: she is forsaken upon her land; [there is] noneto raise her up. 

{5:3} For thus saith the Lord GOD; The city that wentout [by] a thousand shall leave an hundred, and that which went forth[by] an hundred shall leave ten, to the house of Israel.   

{5:4} For thus saith the LORD unto the house of Israel, Seek ye me,and ye shall live: 

{5:5} But seek not Bethel, nor enter into Gilgal,and pass not to Beer-sheba: for Gilgal shall surely go into captivity,and Bethel shall come to nought. 

{5:6} Seek the LORD, and ye shalllive; lest he break out like fire in the house of Joseph, and devour[it,] and [there be] none to quench [it] in Bethel. 

{5:7} Ye who turnjudgment to wormwood, and leave off righteousness in the earth, 

{5:8}[Seek him] that maketh the seven stars and Orion, and turneth theshadow of death into the morning, and maketh the day dark with night:that calleth for the waters of the sea, and poureth them out upon theface of the earth: The LORD [is] his name: 

{5:9} That strengtheneth thespoiled against the strong, so that the spoiled shall come against thefortress. 

{5:10} They hate him that rebuketh in the gate, and theyabhor him that speaketh uprightly. 

{5:11} Forasmuch therefore as yourtreading [is] upon the poor, and ye take from him burdens of wheat: yehave built houses of hewn stone, but ye shall not dwell in them; yehave planted pleasant vineyards, but ye shall not drink wine of them.

{5:12} For I know your manifold transgressions and your mighty sins:they afflict the just, they take a bribe, and they turn aside the poorin the gate [from their right. ]

{5:13} Therefore the prudent shall keepsilence in that time; for it [is] an evil time. 

{5:14} Seek good, andnot evil, that ye may live: and so the LORD, the God of hosts, shall bewith you, as ye have spoken. 

{5:15} Hate the evil, and love the good,and establish judgment in the gate: it may be that the LORD God ofhosts will be gracious unto the remnant of Joseph. 

{5:16} Therefore theLORD, the God of hosts, the Lord, saith thus; Wailing [shall be] in allstreets; and they shall say in all the highways, Alas! alas! and theyshall call the husbandman to mourning, and such as are skilful oflamentation to wailing. 

{5:17} And in all vineyards [shall be] wailing:for I will pass through thee, saith the LORD. 

{5:18} Woe unto you thatdesire the day of the LORD! to what end [is] it for you? the day of theLORD [is] darkness, and not light. 

{5:19} As if a man did flee from alion, and a bear met him; or went into the house, and leaned his handon the wall, and a serpent bit him. 

{5:20} [Shall] not the day of theLORD [be] darkness, and not light? even very dark, and no brightness init?   

{5:21} I hate, I despise your feast days, and I will not smell inyour solemn assemblies. 

{5:22} Though ye offer me burnt offerings andyour meat offerings, I will not accept [them:] neither will I regardthe peace offerings of your fat beasts. 

{5:23} Take thou away from methe noise of thy songs; for I will not hear the melody of thy viols.

{5:24} But let judgment run down as waters, and righteousness as amighty stream. 

{5:25} Have ye offered unto me sacrifices and offeringsin the wilderness forty years, O house of Israel? 

{5:26} But ye haveborne the tabernacle of your Moloch and Chiun your images, the star ofyour god, which ye made to yourselves. 

{5:27} Therefore will I causeyou to go into captivity beyond Damascus, saith the LORD, whose name[is] The God of hosts.   

{6:1} Woe to them [that are] at ease in Zion, and trust in themountain of Samaria, [which are] named chief of the nations, to whomthe house of Israel came! 

{6:2} Pass ye unto Calneh, and see; and fromthence go ye to Hamath the great: then go down to Gath of thePhilistines: [be they] better than these kingdoms? or their bordergreater than your border? 

{6:3} Ye that put far away the evil day, andcause the seat of violence to come near; 

{6:4} That lie upon beds ofivory, and stretch themselves upon their couches, and eat the lambs outof the flock, and the calves out of the midst of the stall; 

{6:5} Thatchant to the sound of the viol, [and] invent to themselves instrumentsof musick, like David; 

{6:6} That drink wine in bowls, and anointthemselves with the chief ointments: but they are not grieved for theaffliction of Joseph.   

{6:7} Therefore now shall they go captive with the first that gocaptive, and the banquet of them that stretched themselves shall beremoved. 

{6:8} The Lord GOD hath sworn by himself, saith the LORD theGod of hosts, I abhor the excellency of Jacob, and hate his palaces:therefore will I deliver up the city with all that is therein. 

{6:9}And it shall come to pass, if there remain ten men in one house, thatthey shall die. 

{6:10} And a man's uncle shall take him up, and he thatburneth him, to bring out the bones out of the house, and shall sayunto him that [is] by the sides of the house, [Is there] yet [any] withthee? and he shall say, No. Then shall he say, Hold thy tongue: for wemay not make mention of the name of the LORD. 

{6:11} For, behold, theLORD commandeth, and he will smite the great house with breaches, andthe little house with clefts.   

{6:12} Shall horses run upon the rock? will [one] plow [there] withoxen? for ye have turned judgment into gall, and the fruit ofrighteousness into hemlock: 

{6:13} Ye which rejoice in a thing ofnought, which say, Have we not taken to us horns by our own strength?

{6:14} But, behold, I will raise up against you a nation, O house ofIsrael, saith the LORD the God of hosts; and they shall afflict youfrom the entering in of Hemath unto the river of the wilderness.   

{7:1} Thus hath the Lord GOD shewed unto me; and, behold, he formedgrasshoppers in the beginning of the shooting up of the latter growth;and, lo, [it was] the latter growth after the king's mowings. 

{7:2} Andit came to pass, [that] when they had made an end of eating the grassof the land, then I said, O Lord GOD, forgive, I beseech thee: by whomshall Jacob arise? for he [is] small. 

{7:3} The LORD repented for this:It shall not be, saith the LORD.   

{7:4} Thus hath the Lord GOD shewed unto me: and, behold, the LordGOD called to contend by fire, and it devoured the great deep, and dideat up a part. 

{7:5} Then said I, O Lord GOD, cease, I beseech thee: bywhom shall Jacob arise? for he [is] small. 

{7:6} The LORD repented forthis: This also shall not be, saith the Lord GOD.   

{7:7} Thus he shewed me: and, behold, the Lord stood upon a wall[made] by a plumbline, with a plumbline in his hand. 

{7:8} And the LORDsaid unto me, Amos, what seest thou? And I said, A plumbline. Then saidthe Lord, Behold, I will set a plumbline in the midst of my peopleIsrael: I will not again pass by them any more: 

{7:9} And the highplaces of Isaac shall be desolate, and the sanctuaries of Israel shallbe laid waste; and I will rise against the house of Jeroboam with thesword.   

{7:10} Then Amaziah the priest of Bethel sent to Jeroboam king ofIsrael, saying, Amos hath conspired against thee in the midst of thehouse of Israel: the land is not able to bear all his words. 

{7:11} Forthus Amos saith, Jeroboam shall die by the sword, and Israel shallsurely be led away captive out of their own land. 

{7:12} Also Amaziahsaid unto Amos, O thou seer, go, flee thee away into the land of Judah,and there eat bread, and prophesy there: 

{7:13} But prophesy not againany more at Bethel: for it [is] the king's chapel, and it [is] theking's court.   

{7:14} Then answered Amos, and said to Amaziah, I [was] no prophet,neither [was] I a prophet's son; but I [was] an herdman, and a gathererof sycomore fruit: 

{7:15} And the LORD took me as I followed the flock,and the LORD said unto me, Go, prophesy unto my people Israel.   

{7:16} Now therefore hear thou the word of the LORD: Thou sayest,Prophesy not against Israel, and drop not [thy word] against the houseof Isaac. 

{7:17} Therefore thus saith the LORD; Thy wife shall be anharlot in the city, and thy sons and thy daughters shall fall by thesword, and thy land shall be divided by line; and thou shalt die in apolluted land: and Israel shall surely go into captivity forth of hisland.   

{8:1} Thus hath the Lord GOD shewed unto me: and behold a basket ofsummer fruit. 

{8:2} And he said, Amos, what seest thou? And I said, Abasket of summer fruit. Then said the LORD unto me, The end is comeupon my people of Israel; I will not again pass by them any more. 

{8:3}And the songs of the temple shall be howlings in that day, saith theLord GOD: [there shall be] many dead bodies in every place; they shallcast [them] forth with silence.   

{8:4} Hear this, O ye that swallow up the needy, even to make thepoor of the land to fail, 

{8:5} Saying, When will the new moon be gone,that we may sell corn? and the sabbath, that we may set forth wheat,making the ephah small, and the shekel great, and falsifying thebalances by deceit? 

{8:6} That we may buy the poor for silver, and theneedy for a pair of shoes; [yea,] and sell the refuse of the wheat?

{8:7} The LORD hath sworn by the excellency of Jacob, Surely I willnever forget any of their works. 

{8:8} Shall not the land tremble forthis, and every one mourn that dwelleth therein? and it shall rise upwholly as a flood; and it shall be cast out and drowned, as [by] theflood of Egypt. 

{8:9} And it shall come to pass in that day, saith theLord GOD, that I will cause the sun to go down at noon, and I willdarken the earth in the clear day: 

{8:10} And I will turn your feastsinto mourning, and all your songs into lamentation; and I will bring upsackcloth upon all loins, and baldness upon every head; and I will makeit as the mourning of an only [son,] and the end thereof as a bitterday.   

{8:11} Behold, the days come, saith the Lord GOD, that I will send afamine in the land, not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for water, butof hearing the words of the LORD: 

{8:12} And they shall wander from seato sea, and from the north even to the east, they shall run to and froto seek the word of the LORD, and shall not find [it. ]

{8:13} In thatday shall the fair virgins and young men faint for thirst. 

{8:14} Theythat swear by the sin of Samaria, and say, Thy god, O Dan, liveth; and,The manner of Beer-sheba liveth; even they shall fall, and never riseup again.   

{9:1} I saw the LORD standing upon the altar: and he said, Smite thelintel of the door, that the posts may shake: and cut them in the head,all of them; and I will slay the last of them with the sword: he thatfleeth of them shall not flee away, and he that escapeth of them shallnot be delivered. 

{9:2} Though they dig into hell, thence shall minehand take them; though they climb up to heaven, thence will I bringthem down: 

{9:3} And though they hide themselves in the top of Carmel,I will search and take them out thence; and though they be hid from mysight in the bottom of the sea, thence will I command the serpent, andhe shall bite them: 

{9:4} And though they go into captivity beforetheir enemies, thence will I command the sword, and it shall slay them:and I will set mine eyes upon them for evil, and not for good. 

{9:5}And the Lord GOD of hosts [is] he that toucheth the land, and it shallmelt, and all that dwell therein shall mourn: and it shall rise upwholly like a flood; and shall be drowned, as [by] the flood of Egypt.

{9:6} [It is] he that buildeth his stories in the heaven, and hathfounded his troop in the earth; he that calleth for the waters of thesea, and poureth them out upon the face of the earth: The LORD [is] hisname. 

{9:7} [Are] ye not as children of the Ethiopians unto me, Ochildren of Israel? saith the LORD. Have not I brought up Israel out ofthe land of Egypt? and the Philistines from Caphtor, and the Syriansfrom Kir? 

{9:8} Behold, the eyes of the Lord GOD [are] upon the sinfulkingdom, and I will destroy it from off the face of the earth; savingthat I will not utterly destroy the house of Jacob, saith the LORD.

{9:9} For, lo, I will command, and I will sift the house of Israelamong all nations, like as [corn] is sifted in a sieve, yet shall notthe least grain fall upon the earth. 

{9:10} All the sinners of mypeople shall die by the sword, which say, The evil shall not overtakenor prevent us.   

{9:11} In that day will I raise up the tabernacle of David that isfallen, and close up the breaches thereof; and I will raise up hisruins, and I will build it as in the days of old: 

{9:12} That they maypossess the remnant of Edom, and of all the heathen, which are calledby my name, saith the LORD that doeth this. 

{9:13} Behold, the dayscome, saith the LORD, that the plowman shall overtake the reaper, andthe treader of grapes him that soweth seed; and the mountains shalldrop sweet wine, and all the hills shall melt. 

{9:14} And I will bringagain the captivity of my people of Israel, and they shall build thewaste cities, and inhabit [them;] and they shall plant vineyards, anddrink the wine thereof; they shall also make gardens, and eat the fruitof them. 

{9:15} And I will plant them upon their land, and they shallno more be pulled up out of their land which I have given them, saiththe LORD thy God.
