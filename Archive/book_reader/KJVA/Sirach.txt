{The Wisdom of Jesus the Son of Sirach,or Ecclesiasticus   A Prologue made by an uncertain Author   This Jesus was the son of Sirach, and grandchild to Jesus of thesame name with him: this man therefore lived in the latter times, afterthe people had been led away captive, and called home a again, andalmost after all the prophets. Now his grandfather Jesus, as he himselfwitnesseth, was a man of great diligence and wisdom among the Hebrews,who did not only gather the grave and short sentences of wise men, thathad been before him, but himself also uttered some of his own, full ofmuch understanding and wisdom. When as therefore the first Jesus died,leaving this book almost perfected, Sirach his son receiving it afterhim left it to his own son Jesus, who, having gotten it into his hands,compiled it all orderly into one volume, and called it Wisdom,intituling it both by his own name, his father's name, and hisgrandfather's; alluring the hearer by the very name of Wisdom to have agreater love to the study of this book. It containeth therefore wisesayings, dark sentences, and parables, and certain particular ancientgodly stories of men that pleased God; also his prayer and song;moreover, what benefits God had vouchsafed his people, and what plagueshe had heaped upon their enemies. This Jesus did imitate Solomon, andwas no less famous for wisdom and learning, both being indeed a man ofgreat learning, and so reputed also.   The Prologue of the Wisdom of Jesus the Son of Sirach.   Whereas many and great things have been delivered unto us by the lawand the prophets, and by others that have followed their steps, for thewhich things Israel ought to be commended for learning and wisdom; andwhereof not only the readers must needs become skilful themselves, butalso they that desire to learn be able to profit them which arewithout, both by speaking and writing: my grandfather Jesus, when hehad much given himself to the reading of the law, and the prophets, andother books of our fathers, and had gotten therein good judgment, wasdrawn on also himself to write something pertaining to learning andwisdom; to the intent that those which are desirous to learn, and areaddicted to these things, might profit much more in living according tothe law. Wherefore let me intreat you to read it with favour andattention, and to pardon us, wherein we may seem to come short of somewords, which we have laboured to interpret. For the same things utteredin Hebrew, and translated into another tongue, have not the same forcein them: and not only these things, but the law itself, and theprophets, and the rest of the books, have no small difference, whenthey are spoken in their own language. For in the eight and thirtiethyear coming into Egypt, when Euergetes was king, and continuing theresome time, I found a book of no small learning: therefore I thought itmost necessary for me to bestow some diligence and travail to interpretit; using great watchfulness and skill in that space to bring the bookto an end, and set it forth for them also, which in a strange countryare willing to learn, being prepared before in manners to live afterthe law.   

{1:1} All wisdom cometh from the Lord, and is with him for ever.   

{1:2} Who can number the sand of the sea, and the drops of rain, andthe days of eternity?   

{1:3} Who can find out the height of heaven, and the breadth of theearth, and the deep, and wisdom?   

{1:4} Wisdom hath been created before all things, and theunderstanding of prudence from everlasting.   

{1:5} The word of God most high is the fountain of wisdom; and herways are everlasting commandments.   

{1:6} To whom hath the root of wisdom been revealed? or who hathknown her wise counsels?   

{1:7} [Unto whom hath the knowledge of wisdom been made manifest?and who hath understood her great experience?]   

{1:8} There is one wise and greatly to be feared, the Lord sittingupon his throne.   

{1:9} He created her, and saw her, and numbered her, and poured herout upon all his works.   

{1:10} She is with all flesh according to his gift, and he hathgiven her to them that love him.   

{1:11} The fear of the Lord is honour, and glory, and gladness, anda crown of rejoicing.   

{1:12} The fear of the Lord maketh a merry heart, and giveth joy,and gladness, and a long life.   

{1:13} Whoso feareth the Lord, it shall go well with him at thelast, and he shall find favour in the day of his death.   

{1:14} To fear the Lord is the beginning of wisdom: and it wascreated with the faithful in the womb.   

{1:15} She hath built an everlasting foundation with men, and sheshall continue with their seed.   

{1:16} To fear the Lord is fulness of wisdom, and filleth men withher fruits.   

{1:17} She filleth all their house with things desirable, and thegarners with her increase.   

{1:18} The fear of the Lord is a crown of wisdom, making peace andperfect health to flourish; both which are the gifts of God: and itenlargeth their rejoicing that love him.   

{1:19} Wisdom raineth down skill and knowledge of understandingstanding, and exalteth them to honour that hold her fast.   

{1:20} The root of wisdom is to fear the Lord, and the branchesthereof are long life.   

{1:21} The fear of the Lord driveth away sins: and where it ispresent, it turneth away wrath.   

{1:22} A furious man cannot be justified; for the sway of his furyshall be his destruction.   

{1:23} A patient man will tear for a time, and afterward joy shallspring up unto him.   

{1:24} He will hide his words for a time, and the lips of many shalldeclare his wisdom.   

{1:25} The parables of knowledge are in the treasures of wisdom: butgodliness is an abomination to a sinner.   

{1:26} If thou desire wisdom, keep the commandments, and the Lordshall give her unto thee.   

{1:27} For the fear of the Lord is wisdom and instruction: and faithand meekness are his delight.   

{1:28} Distrust not the fear of the Lord when thou art poor: andcome not unto him with a double heart.   

{1:29} Be not an hypocrite in the sight of men, and take good heedwhat thou speakest.   

{1:30} Exalt not thyself, lest thou fall, and bring dishonour uponthy soul, and so God discover thy secrets, and cast thee down in themidst of the congregation, because thou camest not in truth to the fearof the Lord, but thy heart is full of deceit.   

{2:1} My son, if thou come to serve the Lord, prepare thy soul fortemptation.   

{2:2} Set thy heart aright, and constantly endure, and make nothaste in time of trouble.   

{2:3} Cleave unto him, and depart not away, that thou mayest beincreased at thy last end.   

{2:4} Whatsoever is brought upon thee take cheerfully, and bepatient when thou art changed to a low estate.   

{2:5} For gold is tried in the fire, and acceptable men in thefurnace of adversity.   

{2:6} Believe in him, and he will help thee; order thy way aright,and trust in him.   

{2:7} Ye that fear the Lord, wait for his mercy; and go not aside,lest ye fall.   

{2:8} Ye that fear the Lord, believe him; and your reward shall notfail.   

{2:9} Ye that fear the Lord, hope for good, and for everlasting joyand mercy.   

{2:10} Look at the generations of old, and see; did ever any trustin the Lord, and was confounded? or did any abide in his fear, and wasforsaken? or whom did he ever despise, that called upon him?   

{2:11} For the Lord is full of compassion and mercy, longsuffering,and very pitiful, and forgiveth sins, and saveth in time of affliction.   

{2:12} Woe be to fearful hearts, and faint hands, and the sinnerthat goeth two ways!   

{2:13} Woe unto him that is fainthearted! for he believeth not;therefore shall he not be defended.   

{2:14} Woe unto you that have lost patience! and what will ye dowhen the Lord shall visit you?   

{2:15} They that fear the Lord will not disobey his Word; and theythat love him will keep his ways.   

{2:16} They that fear the Lord will seek that which is well,pleasing unto him; and they that love him shall be filled with the law.   

{2:17} They that fear the Lord will prepare their hearts, and humbletheir souls in his sight,   

{2:18} Saying, We will fall into the hands of the Lord, and not intothe hands of men: for as his majesty is, so is his mercy.   

{3:1} Hear me your father, O children, and do thereafter, that yemay be safe.   

{3:2} For the Lord hath given the father honour over the children,and hath confirmed the authority of the mother over the sons.   

{3:3} Whoso honoureth his father maketh an atonement for his sins:   

{3:4} And he that honoureth his mother is as one that layeth uptreasure.   

{3:5} Whoso honoureth his father shall have joy of his own children;and when he maketh his prayer, he shall be heard.   

{3:6} He that honoureth his father shall have a long life; and hethat is obedient unto the Lord shall be a comfort to his mother.   

{3:7} He that feareth the Lord will honour his father, and will doservice unto his parents, as to his masters.   

{3:8} Honour thy father and mother both in word and deed, that ablessing may come upon thee from them.   

{3:9} For the blessing of the father establisheth the houses ofchildren; but the curse of the mother rooteth out foundations.   

{3:10} Glory not in the dishonour of thy father; for thy father'sdishonour is no glory unto thee.   

{3:11} For the glory of a man is from the honour of his father; anda mother in dishonour is a reproach to the children.   

{3:12} My son, help thy father in his age, and grieve him not aslong as he liveth.   

{3:13} And if his understanding fail, have patience with him; anddespise him not when thou art in thy full strength.   

{3:14} For the relieving of thy father shall not be forgotten: andinstead of sins it shall be added to build thee up.   

{3:15} In the day of thine affliction it shall be remembered; thysins also shall melt away, as the ice in the fair warm weather.   

{3:16} He that forsaketh his father is as a blasphemer; and he thatangereth his mother is cursed: of God.   

{3:17} My son, go on with thy business in meekness; so shalt thou bebeloved of him that is approved.   

{3:18} The greater thou art, the more humble thyself, and thou shaltfind favour before the Lord.   

{3:19} Many are in high place, and of renown: but mysteries arerevealed unto the meek.   

{3:20} For the power of the Lord is great, and he is honoured of thelowly.   

{3:21} Seek not out things that are too hard for thee, neithersearch the things that are above thy strength.   

{3:22} But what is commanded thee, think thereupon with reverence,for it is not needful for thee to see with thine eyes the things thatare in secret.   

{3:23} Be not curious in unnecessary matters: for more things areshewed unto thee than men understand.   

{3:24} For many are deceived by their own vain opinion; and an evilsuspicion hath overthrown their judgment.   

{3:25} Without eyes thou shalt want light: profess not the knowledgetherefore that thou hast not.   

{3:26} A stubborn heart shall fare evil at the last; and he thatloveth danger shall perish therein.   

{3:27} An obstinate heart shall be laden with sorrows; and thewicked man shall heap sin upon sin.   

{3:28} In the punishment of the proud there is no remedy; for theplant of wickedness hath taken root in him.   

{3:29} The heart of the prudent will understand a parable; and anattentive ear is the desire of a wise man.   

{3:30} Water will quench a flaming fire; and alms maketh anatonement for sins.   

{3:31} And he that requiteth good turns is mindful of that which maycome hereafter; and when he falleth, he shall find a stay.   

{4:1} My son, defraud not the poor of his living, and make not theneedy eyes to wait long.   

{4:2} Make not an hungry soul sorrowful; neither provoke a man inhis distress.   

{4:3} Add not more trouble to an heart that is vexed; and defer notto give to him that is in need.   

{4:4} Reject not the supplication of the afflicted; neither turnaway thy face from a poor man.   

{4:5} Turn not away thine eye from the needy, and give him noneoccasion to curse thee:   

{4:6} For if he curse thee in the bitterness of his soul, his prayershall be heard of him that made him.   

{4:7} Get thyself the love of the congregation, and bow thy head toa great man.   

{4:8} Let it not grieve thee to bow down thine ear to the poor, andgive him a friendly answer with meekness.   

{4:9} Deliver him that suffereth wrong from the hand of theoppressor; and be not fainthearted when thou sittest in judgment.   

{4:10} Be as a father unto the fatherless, and instead of an husbandunto their mother: so shalt thou be as the son of the most High, and heshall love thee more than thy mother doth.   

{4:11} Wisdom exalteth her children, and layeth hold of them thatseek her.   

{4:12} He that loveth her loveth life; and they that seek to herearly shall be filled with joy.   

{4:13} He that holdeth her fast shall inherit glory; and wheresoevershe entereth, the Lord will bless.   

{4:14} They that serve her shall minister to the Holy One: and themthat love her the Lord doth love.   

{4:15} Whoso giveth ear unto her shall judge the nations: and hethat attendeth unto her shall dwell securely.   

{4:16} If a man commit himself unto her, he shall inherit her; andhis generation shall hold her in possession.   

{4:17} For at the first she will walk with him by crooked ways, andbring fear and dread upon him, and torment him with her discipline,until she may trust his soul, and try him by her laws.   

{4:18} Then will she return the straight way unto him, and comforthim, and shew him her secrets.   

{4:19} But if he go wrong, she will forsake him, and give him overto his own ruin.   

{4:20} Observe the opportunity, and beware of evil; and be notashamed when it concerneth thy soul.   

{4:21} For there is a shame that bringeth sin; and there is a shamewhich is glory and grace.   

{4:22} Accept no person against thy soul, and let not the reverenceof any man cause thee to fall.   

{4:23} And refrain not to speak, when there is occasion to do good,and hide not thy wisdom in her beauty.   

{4:24} For by speech wisdom shall be known: and learning by the wordof the tongue.   

{4:25} In no wise speak against the truth; but be abashed of theerror of thine ignorance.   

{4:26} Be not ashamed to confess thy sins; and force not the courseof the river.   

{4:27} Make not thyself an underling to a foolish man; neitheraccept the person of the mighty.   

{4:28} Strive for the truth unto death, and the Lord shall fight forthee.   

{4:29} Be not hasty in thy tongue, and in thy deeds slack and remiss.   

{4:30} Be not as a lion in thy house, nor frantick among thyservants.   

{4:31} Let not thine hand be stretched out to receive, and shut whenthou shouldest repay.   

{5:1} Set thy heart upon thy goods; and say not, I have enough formy life.   

{5:2} Follow not thine own mind and thy strength, to walk in theways of thy heart:   

{5:3} And say not, Who shall controul me for my works? for the Lordwill surely revenge thy pride.   

{5:4} Say not, I have sinned, and what harm hath happened unto me?for the Lord is longsuffering, he will in no wise let thee go.   

{5:5} Concerning propitiation, be not without fear to add sin untosin:   

{5:6} And say not His mercy is great; he will be pacified for themultitude of my sins: for mercy and wrath come from him, and hisindignation resteth upon sinners.   

{5:7} Make no tarrying to turn to the Lord, and put not off from dayto day: for suddenly shall the wrath of the Lord come forth, and in thysecurity thou shalt be destroyed, and perish in the day of vengeance.   

{5:8} Set not thine heart upon goods unjustly gotten, for they shallnot profit thee in the day of calamity.   

{5:9} Winnow not with every wind, and go not into every way: for sodoth the sinner that hath a double tongue.   

{5:10} Be stedfast in thy understanding; and let thy word be thesame.   

{5:11} Be swift to hear; and let thy life be sincere; and withpatience give answer.   

{5:12} If thou hast understanding, answer thy neighbour; if not, laythy hand upon thy mouth.   

{5:13} Honour and shame is in talk: and the tongue of man is hisfall.   

{5:14} Be not called a whisperer, and lie not in wait with thytongue: for a foul shame is upon the thief, and an evil condemnationupon the double tongue.   

{5:15} Be not ignorant of any thing in a great matter or a small.   

{6:1} Instead of a friend become not an enemy; for [thereby] thoushalt inherit an ill name, shame, and reproach: even so shall a sinnerthat hath a double tongue.   

{6:2} Extol not thyself in the counsel of thine own heart; that thysoul be not torn in pieces as a bull [straying alone.]   

{6:3} Thou shalt eat up thy leaves, and lose thy fruit, and leavethyself as a dry tree.   

{6:4} A wicked soul shall destroy him that hath it, and shall makehim to be laughed to scorn of his enemies.   

{6:5} Sweet language will multiply friends: and a fairspeakingtongue will increase kind greetings.   

{6:6} Be in peace with many: nevertheless have but one counsellor ofa thousand.   

{6:7} If thou wouldest get a friend, prove him first and be nothasty to credit him.   

{6:8} For some man is a friend for his own occasion, and will notabide in the day of thy trouble.   

{6:9} And there is a friend, who being turned to enmity, and strifewill discover thy reproach.   

{6:10} Again, some friend is a companion at the table, and will notcontinue in the day of thy affliction.   

{6:11} But in thy prosperity he will be as thyself, and will be boldover thy servants.   

{6:12} If thou be brought low, he will be against thee, and willhide himself from thy face.   

{6:13} Separate thyself from thine enemies, and take heed of thyfriends.   

{6:14} A faithfull friend is a strong defence: and he that hathfound such an one hath found a treasure.   

{6:15} Nothing doth countervail a faithful friend, and hisexcellency is invaluable.   

{6:16} A faithful friend is the medicine of life; and they that fearthe Lord shall find him.   

{6:17} Whoso feareth the Lord shall direct his friendship aright:for as he is, so shall his neighbour be also.   

{6:18} My son, gather instruction from thy youth up: so shalt thoufind wisdom till thine old age.   

{6:19} Come unto her as one that ploweth and soweth, and wait forher good fruits: for thou shalt not toil much in labouring about her,but thou shalt eat of her fruits right soon.   

{6:20} She is very unpleasant to the unlearned: he that is withoutunderstanding will not remain with her.   

{6:21} She will lie upon him as a mighty stone of trial; and he willcast her from him ere it be long.   

{6:22} For wisdom is according to her name, and she is not manifestunto many.   

{6:23} Give ear, my son, receive my advice, and refuse not mycounsel,   

{6:24} And put thy feet into her fetters, and thy neck into herchain.   

{6:25} Bow down thy shoulder, and bear her, and be not grieved withher bonds.   

{6:26} Come unto her with thy whole heart, and keep her ways withall thy power.   

{6:27} Search, and seek, and she shall be made known unto thee: andwhen thou hast got hold of her, let her not go.   

{6:28} For at the last thou shalt find her rest, and that shall beturned to thy joy.   

{6:29} Then shall her fetters be a strong defence for thee, and herchains a robe of glory.   

{6:30} For there is a golden ornament upon her, and her bands arepurple lace.   

{6:31} Thou shalt put her on as a robe of honour, and shalt put herabout thee as a crown of joy.   

{6:32} My son, if thou wilt, thou shalt be taught: and if thou wiltapply thy mind, thou shalt be prudent.   

{6:33} If thou love to hear, thou shalt receive understanding: andif thou bow thine ear, thou shalt be wise,   

{6:34} Stand in the multitude of the elders; and cleave unto himthat is wise.   

{6:35} Be willing to hear every godly discourse; and let not theparables of understanding escape thee.   

{6:36} And if thou seest a man of understanding, get thee betimesunto him, and let thy foot wear the steps of his door.   

{6:37} Let thy mind be upon the ordinances of the Lord and meditatecontinually in his commandments: he shall establish thine heart, andgive thee wisdom at thine owns desire.   

{7:1} Do no evil, so shall no harm come unto thee.   

{7:2} Depart from the unjust, and iniquity shall turn away from thee.   

{7:3} My son, sow not upon the furrows of unrighteousness, and thoushalt not reap them sevenfold.   

{7:4} Seek not of the Lord preeminence, neither of the king the seatof honour.   

{7:5} justify not thyself before the Lord; and boast not of thywisdom before the king.   

{7:6} Seek not to be judge, being not able to take away iniquity;lest at any time thou fear the person of the mighty, an stumblingblockin the way of thy uprightness.   

{7:7} Offend not against the multitude of a city, and then thoushalt not cast thyself down among the people.   

{7:8} Bind not one sin upon another; for in one thou shalt not beunpunished.   

{7:9} Say not, God will look upon the multitude of my oblations, andwhen I offer to the most high God, he will accept it.   

{7:10} Be not fainthearted when thou makest thy prayer, and neglectnot to give alms.   

{7:11} Laugh no man to scorn in the bitterness of his soul: forthere is one which humbleth and exalteth.   

{7:12} Devise not a lie against thy brother; neither do the like tothy friend.   

{7:13} Use not to make any manner of lie: for the custom thereof isnot good.   

{7:14} Use not many words in a multitude of elders, and make notmuch babbling when thou prayest.   

{7:15} Hate not laborious work, neither husbandry, which the mostHigh hath ordained.   

{7:16} Number not thyself among the multitude of sinners, butremember that wrath will not tarry long.   

{7:17} Humble thyself greatly: for the vengeance of the ungodly isfire and worms.   

{7:18} Change not a friend for any good by no means; neither afaithful brother for the gold of Ophir.   

{7:19} Forego not a wise and good woman: for her grace is above gold.   

{7:20} Whereas thy servant worketh truly, entreat him not evil. northe hireling that bestoweth himself wholly for thee.   

{7:21} Let thy soul love a good servant, and defraud him not ofliberty.   

{7:22} Hast thou cattle? have an eye to them: and if they be for thyprofit, keep them with thee.   

{7:23} Hast thou children? instruct them, and bow down their neckfrom their youth.   

{7:24} Hast thou daughters? have a care of their body, and shew notthyself cheerful toward them.   

{7:25} Marry thy daughter, and so shalt thou have performed aweighty matter: but give her to a man of understanding.   

{7:26} Hast thou a wife after thy mind? forsake her not: but givenot thyself over to a light woman.   

{7:27} Honour thy father with thy whole heart, and forget not thesorrows of thy mother.   

{7:28} Remember that thou wast begotten of them; and how canst thourecompense them the things that they have done for thee?   

{7:29} Fear the Lord with all thy soul, and reverence his priests.   

{7:30} Love him that made thee with all thy strength, and forsakenot his ministers.   

{7:31} Fear the Lord, and honor the priest; and give him hisportion, as it is commanded thee; the firstfruits, and the trespassoffering, and the gift of the shoulders, and the sacrifice ofsanctification, and the firstfruits of the holy things.   

{7:32} And stretch thine hand unto the poor, that thy blessing maybe perfected.   

{7:33} A gift hath grace in the sight of every man living; and forthe dead detain it not.   

{7:34} Fail not to be with them that weep, and mourn with them thatmourn.   

{7:35} Be not slow to visit the sick: for that shall make thee to bebeloved.   

{7:36} Whatsoever thou takest in hand, remember the end, and thoushalt never do amiss.   

{8:1} Strive not with a mighty man' lest thou fall into his hands.   

{8:2} Be not at variance with a rich man, lest he overweigh thee:for gold hath destroyed many, and perverted the hearts of kings.   

{8:3} Strive not with a man that is full of tongue, and heap notwood upon his fire.   

{8:4} Jest not with a rude man, lest thy ancestors be disgraced.   

{8:5} Reproach not a man that turneth from sin, but remember that weare all worthy of punishment.   

{8:6} Dishonour not a man in his old age: for even some of us waxold.   

{8:7} Rejoice not over thy greatest enemy being dead, but rememberthat we die all.   

{8:8} Despise not the discourse of the wise, but acquaint thyselfwith their proverbs: for of them thou shalt learn instruction, and howto serve great men with ease.   

{8:9} Miss not the discourse of the elders: for they also learned oftheir fathers, and of them thou shalt learn understanding, and to giveanswer as need requireth.   

{8:10} Kindle not the coals of a sinner, lest thou be burnt with theflame of his fire.   

{8:11} Rise not up [in anger] at the presence of an injuriousperson, lest he lie in wait to entrap thee in thy words   

{8:12} Lend not unto him that is mightier than thyself; for if thoulendest him, count it but lost.   

{8:13} Be not surety above thy power: for if thou be surety, takecare to pay it.   

{8:14} Go not to law with a judge; for they will judge for himaccording to his honour.   

{8:15} Travel not by the way with a bold fellow, lest he becomegrievous unto thee: for he will do according to his own will, and thoushalt perish with him through his folly.   

{8:16} Strive not with an angry man, and go not with him into asolitary place: for blood is as nothing in his sight, and where thereis no help, he will overthrow thee.   

{8:17} Consult not with a fool; for he cannot keep counsel.   

{8:18} Do no secret thing before a stranger; for thou knowest notwhat he will bring forth.   

{8:19} Open not thine heart to every man, lest he requite thee witha shrewd turn.   

{9:1} Be not jealous over the wife of thy bosom, and teach her notan evil lesson against thyself.   

{9:2} Give not thy soul unto a woman to set her foot upon thysubstance.   

{9:3} Meet not with an harlot, lest thou fall into her snares.   

{9:4} Use not much the company of a woman that is a singer, lestthou be taken with her attempts.   

{9:5} Gaze not on a maid, that thou fall not by those things thatare precious in her.   

{9:6} Give not thy soul unto harlots, that thou lose not thineinheritance.   

{9:7} Look not round about thee in the streets of the city, neitherwander thou in the solitary place thereof.   

{9:8} Turn away thine eye from a beautiful woman, and look not uponanother's beauty; for many have been deceived by the beauty of a woman;for herewith love is kindled as a fire.   

{9:9} Sit not at all with another man's wife, nor sit down with herin thine arms, and spend not thy money with her at the wine; lest thineheart incline unto her, and so through thy desire thou fall intodestruction.   

{9:10} Forsake not an old friend; for the new is not comparable tohim: a new friend is as new wine; when it is old, thou shalt drink itwith pleasure.   

{9:11} Envy not the glory of a sinner: for thou knowest not whatshall be his end.   

{9:12} Delight not in the thing that the ungodly have pleasure in;but remember they shall not go unpunished unto their grave.   

{9:13} Keep thee far from the man that hath power to kill; so shaltthou not doubt the fear of death: and if thou come unto him, make nofault, lest he take away thy life presently: remember that thou goestin the midst of snares, and that thou walkest upon the battlements ofthe city.   

{9:14} As near as thou canst, guess at thy neighbour, and consultwith the wise.   

{9:15} Let thy talk be with the wise, and all thy communication inthe law of the most High.   

{9:16} And let just men eat and drink with thee; and let thyglorying be in the fear of the Lord.   

{9:17} For the hand of the artificer the work shall be commended:and the wise ruler of the people for his speech.   

{9:18} A man of an ill tongue is dangerous in his city; and he thatis rash in his talk shall be hated.   

{10:1} A wise judge will instruct his people; and the government ofa prudent man is well ordered.   

{10:2} As the judge of the people is himself, so are his officers;and what manner of man the ruler of the city is, such are all they thatdwell therein.   

{10:3} An unwise king destroyeth his people; but through theprudence of them which are in authority the city shall be inhabited.   

{10:4} The power of the earth is in the hand of the Lord, and in duetime he will set over it one that is profitable.   

{10:5} In the hand of God is the prosperity of man: and upon theperson of the scribe shall he lay his honour.   

{10:6} Bear not hatred to thy neighbour for every wrong; and donothing at all by injurious practices.   

{10:7} Pride is hateful before God and man: and by both doth onecommit iniquity.   

{10:8} Because of unrighteous dealings, injuries, and riches got bydeceit, the kingdom is translated from one people to another.   

{10:9} Why is earth and ashes proud? There is not a more wickedthing than a covetous man: for such an one setteth his own soul tosale; because while he liveth he casteth away his bowels.   

{10:10} The physician cutteth off a long disease; and he that is today a king to morrow shall die.   

{10:11} For when a man is dead, he shall inherit creeping things,beasts, and worms.   

{10:12} The beginning of pride is when one departeth from God, andhis heart is turned away from his Maker.   

{10:13} For pride is the beginning of sin, and he that hath it shallpour out abomination: and therefore the Lord brought upon them strangecalamities, and overthrew them utterly.   

{10:14} The Lord hath cast down the thrones of proud princes, andset up the meek in their stead.   

{10:15} The Lord hath plucked up the roots of the proud nations, andplanted the lowly in their place.   

{10:16} The Lord overthrew countries of the heathen, and destroyedthem to the foundations of the earth.   

{10:17} He took some of them away, and destroyed them, and hath madetheir memorial to cease from the earth.   

{10:18} Pride was not made for men, nor furious anger for them thatare born of a woman.   

{10:19} They that fear the Lord are a sure seed, and they that lovehim an honourable plant: they that regard not the law are adishonourable seed; they that transgress the commandments are adeceivable seed.   

{10:20} Among brethren he that is chief is honorable; so are theythat fear the Lord in his eyes.   

{10:21} The fear of the Lord goeth before the obtaining ofauthority: but roughness and pride is the losing thereof.   

{10:22} Whether he be rich, noble, or poor, their glory is the fearof the Lord.   

{10:23} It is not meet to despise the poor man that hathunderstanding; neither is it convenient to magnify a sinful man.   

{10:24} Great men, and judges, and potentates, shall be honoured;yet is there none of them greater than he that feareth the Lord.   

{10:25} Unto the servant that is wise shall they that are free doservice: and he that hath knowledge will not grudge when he is reformed.   

{10:26} Be not overwise in doing thy business; and boast not thyselfin the time of thy distress.   

{10:27} Better is he that laboureth, and aboundeth in all things,than he that boasteth himself, and wanteth bread.   

{10:28} My son, glorify thy soul in meekness, and give it honouraccording to the dignity thereof.   

{10:29} Who will justify him that sinneth against his own soul? andwho will honour him that dishonoureth his own life?   

{10:30} The poor man is honoured for his skill, and the rich man ishonoured for his riches.   

{10:31} He that is honoured in poverty, how much more in riches? andhe that is dishonourable in riches, how much more in poverty?   

{11:1} Wisdom lifteth up the head of him that is of low degree, andmaketh him to sit among great men.   

{11:2} Commend not a man for his beauty; neither abhor a man for hisoutward appearance.   

{11:3} The bee is little among such as fly; but her fruit is thechief of sweet things.   

{11:4} Boast not of thy clothing and raiment, and exalt not thyselfin the day of honour: for the works of the Lord are wonderful, and hisworks among men are hidden.   

{11:5} Many kings have sat down upon the ground; and one that wasnever thought of hath worn the crown.   

{11:6} Many mighty men have been greatly disgraced; and thehonourable delivered into other men's hands.   

{11:7} Blame not before thou hast examined the truth: understandfirst, and then rebuke.   

{11:8} Answer not before thou hast heard the cause: neitherinterrupt men in the midst of their talk.   

{11:9} Strive not in a matter that concerneth thee not; and sit notin judgment with sinners.   

{11:10} My son, meddle not with many matters: for if thou meddlemuch, thou shalt not be innocent; and if thou follow after, thou shaltnot obtain, neither shalt thou escape by fleeing.   

{11:11} There is one that laboureth, and taketh pains, and makethhaste, and is so much the more behind.   

{11:12} Again, there is another that is slow, and hath need of help,wanting ability, and full of poverty; yet the eye of the Lord lookedupon him for good, and set him up from his low estate,   

{11:13} And lifted up his head from misery; so that many that sawfrom him is peace over all the   

{11:14} Prosperity and adversity, life and death, poverty andriches, come of the Lord.   

{11:15} Wisdom, knowledge, and understanding of the law, are of theLord: love, and the way of good works, are from him.   

{11:16} Error and darkness had their beginning together withsinners: and evil shall wax old with them that glory therein.   

{11:17} The gift of the Lord remaineth with the ungodly, and hisfavour bringeth prosperity for ever.   

{11:18} There is that waxeth rich by his wariness and pinching, andthis his the portion of his reward:   

{11:19} Whereas he saith, I have found rest, and now will eatcontinually of my goods; and yet he knoweth not what time shall comeupon him, and that he must leave those things to others, and die.   

{11:20} Be stedfast in thy covenant, and be conversant therein, andwax old in thy work.   

{11:21} Marvel not at the works of sinners; but trust in the Lord,and abide in thy labour: for it is an easy thing in the sight of theLord on the sudden to make a poor man rich.   

{11:22} The blessing of the Lord is in the reward of the godly, andsuddenly he maketh his blessing flourish.   

{11:23} Say not, What profit is there of my service? and what goodthings shall I have hereafter?   

{11:24} Again, say not, I have enough, and possess many things, andwhat evil shall I have hereafter?   

{11:25} In the day of prosperity there is a forgetfulness ofaffliction: and in the day of affliction there is no more remembranceof prosperity.   

{11:26} For it is an easy thing unto the Lord in the day of death toreward a man according to his ways.   

{11:27} The affliction of an hour maketh a man forget pleasure: andin his end his deeds shall be discovered.   

{11:28} Judge none blessed before his death: for a man shall beknown in his children.   

{11:29} Bring not every man into thine house: for the deceitful manhath many trains.   

{11:30} Like as a partridge taken [and kept] in a cage, so is theheart of the proud; and like as a spy, watcheth he for thy fall:   

{11:31} For he lieth in wait, and turneth good into evil, and inthings worthy praise will lay blame upon thee.   

{11:32} Of a spark of fire a heap of coals is kindled: and a sinfulman layeth wait for blood.   

{11:33} Take heed of a mischievous man, for he worketh wickedness;lest he bring upon thee a perpetual blot.   

{11:34} Receive a stranger into thine house, and he will disturbthee, and turn thee out of thine own.   

{12:1} When thou wilt do good know to whom thou doest it; so shaltthou be thanked for thy benefits.   

{12:2} Do good to the godly man, and thou shalt find a recompence;and if not from him, yet from the most High.   

{12:3} There can no good come to him that is always occupied inevil, nor to him that giveth no alms.   

{12:4} Give to the godly man, and help not a sinner.   

{12:5} Do well unto him that is lowly, but give not to the ungodly:hold back thy bread, and give it not unto him, lest he overmaster theethereby: for [else] thou shalt receive twice as much evil for all thegood thou shalt have done unto him.   

{12:6} For the most High hateth sinners, and will repay vengeanceunto the ungodly, and keepeth them against the mighty day of theirpunishment.   

{12:7} Give unto the good, and help not the sinner.   

{12:8} A friend cannot be known in prosperity: and an enemy cannotbe hidden in adversity.   

{12:9} In the prosperity of a man enemies will be grieved: but inhis adversity even a friend will depart.   

{12:10} Never trust thine enemy: for like as iron rusteth, so is hiswickedness.   

{12:11} Though he humble himself, and go crouching, yet take goodheed and beware of him, and thou shalt be unto him as if thou hadstwiped a lookingglass, and thou shalt know that his rust hath not beenaltogether wiped away.   

{12:12} Set him not by thee, lest, when he hath overthrown thee, hestand up in thy place; neither let him sit at thy right hand, lest heseek to take thy seat, and thou at the last remember my words, and bepricked therewith.   

{12:13} Who will pity a charmer that is bitten with a serpent, orany such as come nigh wild beasts?   

{12:14} So one that goeth to a sinner, and is defiled with him inhis sins, who will pity?   

{12:15} For a while he will abide with thee, but if thou begin tofall, he will not tarry.   

{12:16} An enemy speaketh sweetly with his lips, but in his heart heimagineth how to throw thee into a pit: he will weep with his eyes, butif he find opportunity, he will not be satisfied with blood.   

{12:17} If adversity come upon thee, thou shalt find him therefirst; and though he pretend to help thee, yet shall he undermine thee.   

{12:18} He will shake his head, and clap his hands, and whispermuch, and change his countenance.   

{13:1} He that toucheth pitch shall be defiled therewith; and hethat hath fellowship with a proud man shall be like unto him.   

{13:2} Burden not thyself above thy power while thou livest; andhave no fellowship with one that is mightier and richer than thyself:for how agree the kettle and the earthen pot together? for if the onebe smitten against the other, it shall be broken.   

{13:3} The rich man hath done wrong, and yet he threateneth withal:the poor is wronged, and he must intreat also.   

{13:4} If thou be for his profit, he will use thee: but if thou havenothing, he will forsake thee.   

{13:5} If thou have any thing, he will live with thee: yea, he willmake thee bare, and will not be sorry for it.   

{13:6} If he have need of thee, he will deceive thee, and smile uponthee, and put thee in hope; he will speak thee fair, and say, Whatwantest thou?   

{13:7} And he will shame thee by his meats, until he have drawn theedry twice or thrice, and at the last he will laugh thee to scornafterward, when he seeth thee, he will forsake thee, and shake his headat thee.   

{13:8} Beware that thou be not deceived and brought down in thyjollity.   

{13:9} If thou be invited of a mighty man, withdraw thyself, and somuch the more will he invite thee.   

{13:10} Press thou not upon him, lest thou be put back; stand notfar off, lest thou be forgotten.   

{13:11} Affect not to be made equal unto him in talk, and believenot his many words: for with much communication will he tempt thee, andsmiling upon thee will get out thy secrets:   

{13:12} But cruelly he will lay up thy words, and will not spare todo thee hurt, and to put thee in prison.   

{13:13} Observe, and take good heed, for thou walkest in peril ofthy overthrowing: when thou hearest these things, awake in thy sleep.   

{13:14} Love the Lord all thy life, and call upon him for thysalvation.   

{13:15} Every beast loveth his like, and every man loveth hisneighbor.   

{13:16} All flesh consorteth according to kind, and a man willcleave to his like.   

{13:17} What fellowship hath the wolf with the lamb? so the sinnerwith the godly.   

{13:18} What agreement is there between the hyena and a dog? andwhat peace between the rich and the poor?   

{13:19} As the wild ass is the lion's prey in the wilderness: so therich eat up the poor.   

{13:20} As the proud hate humility: so doth the rich abhor the poor.   

{13:21} A rich man beginning to fall is held up of his friends: buta poor man being down is thrust away by his friends.   

{13:22} When a rich man is fallen, he hath many helpers: he speakeththings not to be spoken, and yet men justify him: the poor man slipped,and yet they rebuked him too; he spake wisely, and could have no place.   

{13:23} When a rich man speaketh, every man holdeth his tongue, and,look, what he saith, they extol it to the clouds: but if the poor manspeak, they say, What fellow is this? and if he stumble, they will helpto overthrow him.   

{13:24} Riches are good unto him that hath no sin, and poverty isevil in the mouth of the ungodly.   

{13:25} The heart of a man changeth his countenance, whether it befor good or evil: and a merry heart maketh a cheerful countenance.   

{13:26} A cheerful countenance is a token of a heart that is inprosperity; and the finding out of parables is a wearisome labour ofthe mind.   

{14:1} Blessed is the man that hath not slipped with his mouth, andis not pricked with the multitude of sins.   

{14:2} Blessed is he whose conscience hath not condemned him, andwho is not fallen from his hope in the Lord.   

{14:3} Riches are not comely for a niggard: and what should anenvious man do with money?   

{14:4} He that gathereth by defrauding his own soul gathereth forothers, that shall spend his goods riotously.   

{14:5} He that is evil to himself, to whom will he be good? he shallnot take pleasure in his goods.   

{14:6} There is none worse than he that envieth himself; and this isa recompence of his wickedness.   

{14:7} And if he doeth good, he doeth it unwillingly; and at thelast he will declare his wickedness.   

{14:8} The envious man hath a wicked eye; he turneth away his face,and despiseth men.   

{14:9} A covetous man's eye is not satisfied with his portion; andthe iniquity of the wicked drieth up his soul.   

{14:10} A wicked eye envieth [his] bread, and he is a niggard at histable.   

{14:11} My son, according to thy ability do good to thyself, andgive the Lord his due offering.   

{14:12} Remember that death will not be long in coming, and that thecovenant of the grave is not shewed unto thee.   

{14:13} Do good unto thy friend before thou die, and according tothy ability stretch out thy hand and give to him.   

{14:14} Defraud not thyself of the good day, and let not the part ofa good desire overpass thee.   

{14:15} Shalt thou not leave thy travails unto another? and thylabours to be divided by lot?   

{14:16} Give, and take, and sanctify thy soul; for there is noseeking of dainties in the grave.   

{14:17} All flesh waxeth old as a garment: for the covenant from thebeginning is, Thou shalt die the death.   

{14:18} As of the green leaves on a thick tree, some fall, and somegrow; so is the generation of flesh and blood, one cometh to an end,and another is born.   

{14:19} Every work rotteth and consumeth away, and the workerthereof shall go withal.   

{14:20} Blessed is the man that doth meditate good things in wisdom,and that reasoneth of holy things by his understanding. ing.   

{14:21} He that considereth her ways in his heart shall also haveunderstanding in her secrets.   

{14:22} Go after her as one that traceth, and lie in wait in herways.   

{14:23} He that prieth in at her windows shall also hearken at herdoors.   

{14:24} He that doth lodge near her house shall also fasten a pin inher walls.   

{14:25} He shall pitch his tent nigh unto her, and shall lodge in alodging where good things are.   

{14:26} He shall set his children under her shelter, and shall lodgeunder her branches.   

{14:27} By her he shall be covered from heat, and in her glory shallhe dwell.   

{15:1} He that feareth the Lord will do good, and he that hath theknowledge of the law shall obtain her.   

{15:2} And as a mother shall she meet him, and receive him as a wifemarried of a virgin.   

{15:3} With the bread of understanding shall she feed him, and givehim the water of wisdom to drink.   

{15:4} He shall be stayed upon her, and shall not be moved; andshall rely upon her, and shall not be confounded.   

{15:5} She shall exalt him above his neighbours, and in the midst ofthe congregation shall she open his mouth.   

{15:6} He shall find joy and a crown of gladness, and she shallcause him to inherit an everlasting name.   

{15:7} But foolish men shall not attain unto her, and sinners shallnot see her.   

{15:8} For she is far from pride, and men that are liars cannotremember her.   

{15:9} Praise is not seemly in the mouth of a sinner, for it was notsent him of the Lord.   

{15:10} For praise shall be uttered in wisdom, and the Lord willprosper it.   

{15:11} Say not thou, It is through the Lord that I fell away: forthou oughtest not to do the things that he hateth.   

{15:12} Say not thou, He hath caused me to err: for he hath no needof the sinful man.   

{15:13} The Lord hateth all abomination; and they that fear God loveit not.   

{15:14} He himself made man from the beginning, and left him in thehand of his counsel;   

{15:15} If thou wilt, to keep the commandments, and to performacceptable faithfulness.   

{15:16} He hath set fire and water before thee: stretch forth thyhand unto whether thou wilt.   

{15:17} Before man is life and death; and whether him liketh shallbe given him.   

{15:18} For the wisdom of the Lord is great, and he is mighty inpower, and beholdeth all things:   

{15:19} And his eyes are upon them that fear him, and he knowethevery work of man.   

{15:20} He hath commanded no man to do wickedly, neither hath hegiven any man licence to sin.   

{16:1} Desire not a multitude of unprofitable children, neitherdelight in ungodly sons.   

{16:2} Though they multiply, rejoice not in them, except the fear ofthe Lord be with them.   

{16:3} Trust not thou in their life, neither respect theirmultitude: for one that is just is better than a thousand; and betterit is to die without children, than to have them that are ungodly.   

{16:4} For by one that hath understanding shall the city bereplenished: but the kindred of the wicked shall speedily becomedesolate.   

{16:5} Many such things have I seen with mine eyes, and mine earhath heard greater things than these.   

{16:6} In the congregation of the ungodly shall a fire be kindled;and in a rebellious nation wrath is set on fire.   

{16:7} He was not pacified toward the old giants, who fell away inthe strength of their foolishness.   

{16:8} Neither spared he the place where Lot sojourned, but abhorredthem for their pride.   

{16:9} He pitied not the people of perdition, who were taken away intheir sins:   

{16:10} Nor the six hundred thousand footmen, who were gatheredtogether in the hardness of their hearts.   

{16:11} And if there be one stiffnecked among the people, it ismarvel if he escape unpunished: for mercy and wrath are with him; he ismighty to forgive, and to pour out displeasure.   

{16:12} As his mercy is great, so is his correction also: he judgetha man according to his works   

{16:13} The sinner shall not escape with his spoils: and thepatience of the godly shall not be frustrate.   

{16:14} Make way for every work of mercy: for every man shall findaccording to his works.   

{16:15} The Lord hardened Pharaoh, that he should not know him, thathis powerful works might be known to the world.   

{16:16} His mercy is manifest to every creature; and he hathseparated his light from the darkness with an adamant.   

{16:17} Say not thou, I will hide myself from the Lord: shall anyremember me from above? I shall not be remembered among so many people:for what is my soul among such an infinite number of creatures?   

{16:18} Behold, the heaven, and the heaven of heavens, the deep, andthe earth, and all that therein is, shall be moved when he shall visit.   

{16:19} The mountains also and foundations of the earth be shakenwith trembling, when the Lord looketh upon them.   

{16:20} No heart can think upon these things worthily: and who isable to conceive his ways?   

{16:21} It is a tempest which no man can see: for the most part ofhis works are hid.   

{16:22} Who can declare the works of his justice? or who can endurethem? for his covenant is afar off, and the trial of all things is inthe end.   

{16:23} He that wanteth understanding will think upon vain things:and a foolish man erring imagineth follies.   

{16:24} by son, hearken unto me, and learn knowledge, and mark mywords with thy heart.   

{16:25} I will shew forth doctrine in weight, and declare hisknowledge exactly.   

{16:26} The works of the Lord are done in judgment from thebeginning: and from the time he made them he disposed the parts thereof.   

{16:27} He garnished his works for ever, and in his hand are thechief of them unto all generations: they neither labour, nor are weary,nor cease from their works.   

{16:28} None of them hindereth another, and they shall never disobeyhis word.   

{16:29} After this the Lord looked upon the earth, and filled itwith his blessings.   

{16:30} With all manner of living things hath he covered the facethereof; and they shall return into it again.   

{17:1} The Lord created man of the earth, and turned him into itagain.   

{17:2} He gave them few days, and a short time, and power also overthe things therein.   

{17:3} He endued them with strength by themselves, and made themaccording to his image,   

{17:4} And put the fear of man upon all flesh, and gave him dominionover beasts and fowls.   

{17:5} They received the use of the five operations of the Lord, andin the sixth place he imparted them understanding, and in the seventhspeech, an interpreter of the cogitations thereof.   

{17:6} Counsel, and a tongue, and eyes, ears, and a heart, gave hethem to understand.   

{17:7} Withal he filled them with the knowledge of understanding,and shewed them good and evil.   

{17:8} He set his eye upon their hearts, that he might shew them thegreatness of his works.   

{17:9} He gave them to glory in his marvellous acts for ever, thatthey might declare his works with understanding.   

{17:10} And the elect shall praise his holy name.   

{17:11} Beside this he gave them knowledge, and the law of life foran heritage.   

{17:12} He made an everlasting covenant with them, and shewed themhis judgments.   

{17:13} Their eyes saw the majesty of his glory, and their earsheard his glorious voice.   

{17:14} And he said unto them, Beware of all unrighteousness; and hegave every man commandment concerning his neighbour.   

{17:15} Their ways are ever before him, and shall not be hid fromhis eyes.   

{17:16} Every man from his youth is given to evil; neither couldthey make to themselves fleshy hearts for stony.   

{17:17} For in the division of the nations of the whole earth he seta ruler over every people; but Israel is the Lord's portion:   

{17:18} Whom, being his firstborn, he nourisheth with discipline,and giving him the light of his love doth not forsake him.   

{17:19} Therefore all their works are as the sun before him, and hiseyes are continually upon their ways.   

{17:20} None of their unrighteous deeds are hid from him, but alltheir sins are before the Lord   

{17:21} But the Lord being gracious and knowing his workmanship,neither left nor forsook them, but spared them.   

{17:22} The alms of a man is as a signet with him, and he will keepthe good deeds of man as the apple of the eye, and give repentance tohis sons and daughters.   

{17:23} Afterwards he will rise up and reward them, and render theirrecompence upon their heads.   

{17:24} But unto them that repent, he granted them return, andcomforted those that failed in patience.   

{17:25} Return unto the Lord, and forsake thy sins, make thy prayerbefore his face, and offend less.   

{17:26} Turn again to the most High, and turn away from iniquity:for he will lead thee out of darkness into the light of health, andhate thou abomination vehemently.   

{17:27} Who shall praise the most High in the grave, instead of themwhich live and give thanks?   

{17:28} Thanksgiving perisheth from the dead, as from one that isnot: the living and sound in heart shall praise the Lord.   

{17:29} How great is the lovingkindness of the Lord our God, and hiscompassion unto such as turn unto him in holiness!   

{17:30} For all things cannot be in men, because the son of man isnot immortal.   

{17:31} What is brighter than the sun? yet the light thereoffaileth; and flesh and blood will imagine evil.   

{17:32} He vieweth the power of the height of heaven; and all menare but earth and ashes.   

{18:1} He that liveth for ever Hath created all things in general.   

{18:2} The Lord only is righteous, and there is none other but he,   

{18:3} Who governeth the world with the palm of his hand, and allthings obey his will: for he is the King of all, by his power dividingholy things among them from profane.   

{18:4} To whom hath he given power to declare his works? and whoshall find out his noble acts?   

{18:5} Who shall number the strength of his majesty? and who shallalso tell out his mercies?   

{18:6} As for the wondrous works of the Lord, there may nothing betaken from them, neither may any thing be put unto them, neither canthe ground of them be found out.   

{18:7} When a man hath done, then he beginneth; and when he leavethoff, then he shall be doubtful.   

{18:8} What is man, and whereto serveth he? what is his good, andwhat is his evil?   

{18:9} The number of a man's days at the most are an hundred years.   

{18:10} As a drop of water unto the sea, and a gravelstone incomparison of the sand; so are a thousand years to the days of eternity.   

{18:11} Therefore is God patient with them, and poureth forth hismercy upon them.   

{18:12} He saw and perceived their end to be evil; therefore hemultiplied his compassion.   

{18:13} The mercy of man is toward his neighbour; but the mercy ofthe Lord is upon all flesh: he reproveth, and nurtureth, and teachethand bringeth again, as a shepherd his flock.   

{18:14} He hath mercy on them that receive discipline, and thatdiligently seek after his judgments.   

{18:15} My son, blemish not thy good deeds, neither useuncomfortable words when thou givest any thing.   

{18:16} Shall not the dew asswage the heat? so is a word better thana gift.   

{18:17} Lo, is not a word better than a gift? but both are with agracious man.   

{18:18} A fool will upbraid churlishly, and a gift of the enviousconsumeth the eyes.   

{18:19} Learn before thou speak, and use physick or ever thou besick.   

{18:20} Before judgment examine thyself, and in the day ofvisitation thou shalt find mercy.   

{18:21} Humble thyself before thou be sick, and in the time of sinsshew repentance.   

{18:22} Let nothing hinder thee to pay thy vow in due time, anddefer not until death to be justified.   

{18:23} Before thou prayest, prepare thyself; and be not as one thattempteth the Lord.   

{18:24} Think upon the wrath that shall be at the end, and the timeof vengeance, when he shall turn away his face.   

{18:25} When thou hast enough, remember the time of hunger: and whenthou art rich, think upon poverty and need.   

{18:26} From the morning until the evening the time is changed, andall things are soon done before the Lord.   

{18:27} A wise man will fear in every thing, and in the day ofsinning he will beware of offence: but a fool will not observe time.   

{18:28} Every man of understanding knoweth wisdom, and will givepraise unto him that found her.   

{18:29} They that were of understanding in sayings became also wisethemselves, and poured forth exquisite parables.   

{18:30} Go not after thy lusts, but refrain thyself from thineappetites.   

{18:31} If thou givest thy soul the desires that please her, shewill make thee a laughingstock to thine enemies that malign thee.   

{18:32} Take not pleasure in much good cheer, neither be tied to theexpence thereof.   

{18:33} Be not made a beggar by banqueting upon borrowing, when thouhast nothing in thy purse: for thou shalt lie in wait for thine ownlife, and be talked on.   

{19:1} A labouring man that A is given to drunkenness shall not berich: and he that contemneth small things shall fall by little andlittle.   

{19:2} Wine and women will make men of understanding to fall away:and he that cleaveth to harlots will become impudent.   

{19:3} Moths and worms shall have him to heritage, and a bold manshall be taken away.   

{19:4} He that is hasty to give credit is lightminded; and he thatsinneth shall offend against his own soul.   

{19:5} Whoso taketh pleasure in wickedness shall be condemned: buthe that resisteth pleasures crowneth his life.   

{19:6} He that can rule his tongue shall live without strife; and hethat hateth babbling shall have less evil.   

{19:7} Rehearse not unto another that which is told unto thee, andthou shalt fare never the worse.   

{19:8} Whether it be to friend or foe, talk not of other men'slives; and if thou canst without offence, reveal them not.   

{19:9} For he heard and observed thee, and when time cometh he willhate thee.   

{19:10} If thou hast heard a word, let it die with thee; and bebold, it will not burst thee.   

{19:11} A fool travaileth with a word, as a woman in labour of achild.   

{19:12} As an arrow that sticketh in a man's thigh, so is a wordwithin a fool's belly.   

{19:13} Admonish a friend, it may be he hath not done it: and if hehave done it, that he do it no more.   

{19:14} Admonish thy friend, it may be he hath not said it: and ifhe have, that he speak it not again.   

{19:15} Admonish a friend: for many times it is a slander, andbelieve not every tale.   

{19:16} There is one that slippeth in his speech, but not from hisheart; and who is he that hath not offended with his tongue?   

{19:17} Admonish thy neighbour before thou threaten him; and notbeing angry, give place to the law of the most High.   

{19:18} The fear of the Lord is the first step to be accepted [ofhim,] and wisdom obtaineth his love.   

{19:19} The knowledge of the commandments of the Lord is thedoctrine of life: and they that do things that please him shall receivethe fruit of the tree of immortality.   

{19:20} The fear of the Lord is all wisdom; and in all wisdom is theperformance of the law, and the knowledge of his omnipotency.   

{19:21} If a servant say to his master, I will not do as it pleaseththee; though afterward he do it, he angereth him that nourisheth him.   

{19:22} The knowledge of wickedness is not wisdom, neither at anytime the counsel of sinners prudence.   

{19:23} There is a wickedness, and the same an abomination; andthere is a fool wanting in wisdom.   

{19:24} He that hath small understanding, and feareth God, is betterthan one that hath much wisdom, and transgresseth the law of the mostHigh.   

{19:25} There is an exquisite subtilty, and the same is unjust; andthere is one that turneth aside to make judgment appear; and there is awise man that justifieth in judgment.   

{19:26} There is a wicked man that hangeth down his head sadly; butinwardly he is full of deceit,   

{19:27} Casting down his countenance, and making as if he heard not:where he is not known, he will do thee a mischief before thou be aware.   

{19:28} And if for want of power he be hindered from sinning, yetwhen he findeth opportunity he will do evil.   

{19:29} A man may be known by his look, and one that hathunderstanding by his countenance, when thou meetest him.   

{19:30} A man's attire, and excessive laughter, and gait, shew whathe is.   

{20:1} There is a reproof that is not comely: again, some manholdeth his tongue, and he is wise.   

{20:2} It is much better to reprove, than to be angry secretly: andhe that confesseth his fault shall be preserved from hurt.   

{20:3} How good is it, when thou art reproved, to shew repentance!for so shalt thou escape wilful sin.   

{20:4} As is the lust of an eunuch to deflower a virgin; so is hethat executeth judgment with violence.   

{20:5} There is one that keepeth silence, and is found wise: andanother by much babbling becometh hateful.   

{20:6} Some man holdeth his tongue, because he hath not to answer:and some keepeth silence, knowing his time.   

{20:7} A wise man will hold his tongue till he see opportunity: buta babbler and a fool will regard no time.   

{20:8} He that useth many words shall be abhorred; and he thattaketh to himself authority therein shall be hated.   

{20:9} There is a sinner that hath good success in evil things; andthere is a gain that turneth to loss.   

{20:10} There is a gift that shall not profit thee; and there is agift whose recompence is double.   

{20:11} There is an abasement because of glory; and there is thatlifteth up his head from a low estate.   

{20:12} There is that buyeth much for a little, and repayeth itsevenfold.   

{20:13} A wise man by his words maketh him beloved: but the gracesof fools shall be poured out.   

{20:14} The gift of a fool shall do thee no good when thou hast it;neither yet of the envious for his necessity: for he looketh to receivemany things for one.   

{20:15} He giveth little, and upbraideth much; he openeth his mouthlike a crier; to day he lendeth, and to morrow will he ask it again:such an one is to be hated of God and man.   

{20:16} The fool saith, I have no friends, I have no thank for allmy good deeds, and they that eat my bread speak evil of me.   

{20:17} How oft, and of how many shall he be laughed to scorn! forhe knoweth not aright what it is to have; and it is all one unto him asif he had it not.   

{20:18} To slip upon a pavement is better than to slip with thetongue: so the fall of the wicked shall come speedily.   

{20:19} An unseasonable tale will always be in the mouth of theunwise.   

{20:20} A wise sentence shall be rejected when it cometh out of afool's mouth; for he will not speak it in due season.   

{20:21} There is that is hindered from sinning through want: andwhen he taketh rest, he shall not be troubled.   

{20:22} There is that destroyeth his own soul through bashfulness,and by accepting of persons overthroweth himself.   

{20:23} There is that for bashfulness promiseth to his friend, andmaketh him his enemy for nothing.   

{20:24} A lie is a foul blot in a man, yet it is continually in themouth of the untaught.   

{20:25} A thief is better than a man that is accustomed to lie: butthey both shall have destruction to heritage.   

{20:26} The disposition of a liar is dishonourable, and his shame isever with him.   

{20:27} A wise man shall promote himself to honour with his words:and he that hath understanding will please great men.   

{20:28} He that tilleth his land shall increase his heap: and hethat pleaseth great men shall get pardon for iniquity.   

{20:29} Presents and gifts blind the eyes of the wise, and stop uphis mouth that he cannot reprove.   

{20:30} Wisdom that is hid, and treasure that is hoarded up, whatprofit is in them both?   

{20:31} Better is he that hideth his folly than a man that hidethhis wisdom.   

{20:32} Necessary patience in seeking ing the Lord is better than hethat leadeth his life without a guide.   

{21:1} My son, hast thou sinned? do so no more, but ask pardon forthy former sins.   

{21:2} Flee from sin as from the face of a serpent: for if thoucomest too near it, it will bite thee: the teeth thereof are as theteeth of a lion, slaying the souls of men.   

{21:3} All iniquity is as a two edged sword, the wounds whereofcannot be healed.   

{21:4} To terrify and do wrong will waste riches: thus the house ofproud men shall be made desolate.   

{21:5} A prayer out of a poor man's mouth reacheth to the ears ofGod, and his judgment cometh speedily.   

{21:6} He that hateth to be reproved is in the way of sinners: buthe that feareth the Lord will repent from his heart.   

{21:7} An eloquent man is known far and near; but a man ofunderstanding knoweth when he slippeth.   

{21:8} He that buildeth his house with other men's money is like onethat gathereth himself stones for the tomb of his burial.   

{21:9} The congregation of the wicked is like tow wrapped together:and the end of them is a flame of fire to destroy them.   

{21:10} The way of sinners is made plain with stones, but at the endthereof is the pit of hell.   

{21:11} He that keepeth the law of the Lord getteth theunderstanding thereof: and the perfection of the fear of the Lord iswisdom.   

{21:12} He that is not wise will not be taught: but there is awisdom which multiplieth bitterness.   

{21:13} The knowledge of a wise man shall abound like a flood: andhis counsel is like a pure fountain of life.   

{21:14} The inner parts of a fool are like a broken vessel, and hewill hold no knowledge as long as he liveth.   

{21:15} If a skilful man hear a wise word, he will commend it, andadd unto it: but as soon as one of no understanding heareth it, itdispleaseth him, and he casteth it behind his back.   

{21:16} The talking of a fool is like a burden in the way: but graceshall be found in the lips of the wise.   

{21:17} They enquire at the mouth of the wise man in thecongregation, and they shall ponder his words in their heart.   

{21:18} As is a house that is destroyed, so is wisdom to a fool: andthe knowledge of the unwise is as talk without sense.   

{21:19} Doctrine unto fools is as fetters on the feet, and likemanacles on the right hand.   

{21:20} A fool lifteth up his voice with laughter; but a wise mandoth scarce smile a little.   

{21:21} Learning is unto a wise man as an ornament of gold, and likea bracelet upon his right arm.   

{21:22} A foolish man's foot is soon in his [neighbour's] house: buta man of experience is ashamed of him.   

{21:23} A fool will peep in at the door into the house: but he thatis well nurtured will stand without.   

{21:24} It is the rudeness of a man to hearken at the door: but awise man will be grieved with the disgrace.   

{21:25} The lips of talkers will be telling such things as pertainnot unto them: but the words of such as have understanding are weighedin the balance.   

{21:26} The heart of fools is in their mouth: but the mouth of thewise is in their heart.   

{21:27} When the ungodly curseth Satan, he curseth his own soul.   

{21:28} A whisperer defileth his own soul, and is hated wheresoeverhe dwelleth.   

{22:1} A slothful man is compared to a filthy stone, and every onewill hiss him out to his disgrace.   

{22:2} A slothful man is compared to the filth of a dunghill: everyman that takes it up will shake his hand.   

{22:3} An evilnurtured man is the dishonour of his father that begathim: and a [foolish] daughter is born to his loss.   

{22:4} A wise daughter shall bring an inheritance to her husband:but she that liveth dishonestly is her father's heaviness.   

{22:5} She that is bold dishonoureth both her father and herhusband, but they both shall despise her.   

{22:6} A tale out of season [is as] musick in mourning: but stripesand correction of wisdom are never out of time.   

{22:7} Whoso teacheth a fool is as one that glueth a potsherdtogether, and as he that waketh one from a sound sleep.   

{22:8} He that telleth a tale to a fool speaketh to one in aslumber: when he hath told his tale, he will say, What is the matter?   

{22:9} If children live honestly, and have wherewithal, they shallcover the baseness of their parents.   

{22:10} But children, being haughty, through disdain and want ofnurture do stain the nobility of their kindred.   

{22:11} Weep for the dead, for he hath lost the light: and weep forthe fool, for he wanteth understanding: make little weeping for thedead, for he is at rest: but the life of the fool is worse than death.   

{22:12} Seven days do men mourn for him that is dead; but for a fooland an ungodly man all the days of his life.   

{22:13} Talk not much with a fool, and go not to him that hath nounderstanding: beware of him, lest thou have trouble, and thou shaltnever be defiled with his fooleries: depart from him, and thou shaltfind rest, and never be disquieted with madness.   

{22:14} What is heavier than lead? and what is the name thereof, buta fool?   

{22:15} Sand, and salt, and a mass of iron, is easier to bear, thana man without understanding.   

{22:16} As timber girt and bound together in a building cannot beloosed with shaking: so the heart that is stablished by advised counselshall fear at no time.   

{22:17} A heart settled upon a thought of understanding is as a fairplaistering on the wall of a gallery.   

{22:18} Pales set on an high place will never stand against thewind: so a fearful heart in the imagination of a fool cannot standagainst any fear.   

{22:19} He that pricketh the eye will make tears to fall: and hethat pricketh the heart maketh it to shew her knowledge.   

{22:20} Whoso casteth a stone at the birds frayeth them away: and hethat upbraideth his friend breaketh friendship.   

{22:21} Though thou drewest a sword at thy friend, yet despair not:for there may be a returning [to favour.]   

{22:22} If thou hast opened thy mouth against thy friend, fear not;for there may be a reconciliation: except for upbraiding, or pride, ordisclosing of secrets, or a treacherous wound: for for these thingsevery friend will depart.   

{22:23} Be faithful to thy neighbour in his poverty, that thoumayest rejoice in his prosperity: abide stedfast unto him in the timeof his trouble, that thou mayest be heir with him in his heritage: fora mean estate is not always to be contemned: nor the rich that isfoolish to be had in admiration.   

{22:24} As the vapour and smoke of a furnace goeth before the fire;so reviling before blood.   

{22:25} I will not be ashamed to defend a friend; neither will Ihide myself from him.   

{22:26} And if any evil happen unto me by him, every one thatheareth it will beware of him.   

{22:27} Who shall set a watch before my mouth, and a seal of wisdomupon my lips, that I fall not suddenly by them, and that my tonguedestroy me not?   

{23:1} O Lord, Father and Governor of all my whole life, leave menot to their counsels, and let me not fall by them.   

{23:2} Who will set scourges over my thoughts, and the discipline ofwisdom over mine heart? that they spare me not for mine ignorances, andit pass not by my sins:   

{23:3} Lest mine ignorances increase, and my sins abound to mydestruction, and I fall before mine adversaries, and mine enemy rejoiceover me, whose hope is far from thy mercy.   

{23:4} O Lord, Father and God of my life, give me not a proud look,but turn away from thy servants always a haughty mind.   

{23:5} Turn away from me vain hopes and concupiscence, and thoushalt hold him up that is desirous always to serve thee.   

{23:6} Let not the greediness of the belly nor lust of the fleshtake hold of me; and give not over me thy servant into an impudent mind.   

{23:7} Hear, O ye children, the discipline of the mouth: he thatkeepeth it shall never be taken in his lips.   

{23:8} The sinner shall be left in his foolishness: both the evilspeaker and the proud shall fall thereby.   

{23:9} Accustom not thy mouth to swearing; neither use thyself tothe naming of the Holy One.   

{23:10} For as a servant that is continually beaten shall not bewithout a blue mark: so he that sweareth and nameth God continuallyshall not be faultless.   

{23:11} A man that useth much swearing shall be filled withiniquity, and the plague shall never depart from his house: if he shalloffend, his sin shall be upon him: and if he acknowledge not his sin,he maketh a double offence: and if he swear in vain, he shall not beinnocent, but his house shall be full of calamities.   

{23:12} There is a word that is clothed about with death: God grantthat it be not found in the heritage of Jacob; for all such thingsshall be far from the godly, and they shall not wallow in their sins.   

{23:13} Use not thy mouth to intemperate swearing, for therein isthe word of sin.   

{23:14} Remember thy father and thy mother, when thou sittest amonggreat men. Be not forgetful before them, and so thou by thy custombecome a fool, and wish that thou hadst not been born, and curse theyday of thy nativity.   

{23:15} The man that is accustomed to opprobrious words will neverbe reformed all the days of his life.   

{23:16} Two sorts of men multiply sin, and the third will bringwrath: a hot mind is as a burning fire, it will never be quenched tillit be consumed: a fornicator in the body of his flesh will never ceasetill he hath kindled a fire.   

{23:17} All bread is sweet to a whoremonger, he will not leave offtill he die.   

{23:18} A man that breaketh wedlock, saying thus in his heart, Whoseeth me? I am compassed about with darkness, the walls cover me, andno body seeth me; what need I to fear? the most High will not remembermy sins:   

{23:19} Such a man only feareth the eyes of men, and knoweth notthat the eyes of the Lord are ten thousand times brighter than the sun,beholding all the ways of men, and considering the most secret parts.   

{23:20} He knew all things ere ever they were created; so also afterthey were perfected he looked upon them all.   

{23:21} This man shall be punished in the streets of the city, andwhere he suspecteth not he shall be taken.   

{23:22} Thus shall it go also with the wife that leaveth herhusband, and bringeth in an heir by another.   

{23:23} For first, she hath disobeyed the law of the most High; andsecondly, she hath trespassed against her own husband; and thirdly, shehath played the whore in adultery, and brought children by another man.   

{23:24} She shall be brought out into the congregation, andinquisition shall be made of her children.   

{23:25} Her children shall not take root, and her branches shallbring forth no fruit.   

{23:26} She shall leave her memory to be cursed, and her reproachshall not be blotted out.   

{23:27} And they that remain shall know that there is nothing betterthan the fear of the Lord, and that there is nothing sweeter than totake heed unto the commandments of the Lord.   

{23:28} It is great glory to follow the Lord, and to be received ofhim is long life.   

{24:1} Wisdom shall praise herself, and shall glory in the midst ofher people.   

{24:2} In the congregation of the most High shall she open hermouth, and triumph before his power.   

{24:3} I came out of the mouth of the most High, and covered theearth as a cloud.   

{24:4} I dwelt in high places, and my throne is in a cloudy pillar.   

{24:5} I alone compassed the circuit of heaven, and walked in thebottom of the deep.   

{24:6} In the waves of the sea and in all the earth, and in everypeople and nation, I got a possession.   

{24:7} With all these I sought rest: and in whose inheritance shallI abide?   

{24:8} So the Creator of all things gave me a commandment, and hethat made me caused my tabernacle to rest, and said, Let thy dwellingbe in Jacob, and thine inheritance in Israel.   

{24:9} He created me from the beginning before the world, and Ishall never fail.   

{24:10} In the holy tabernacle I served before him; and so was Iestablished in Sion.   

{24:11} Likewise in the beloved city he gave me rest, and inJerusalem was my power.   

{24:12} And I took root in an honourable people, even in the portionof the Lord's inheritance.   

{24:13} I was exalted like a cedar in Libanus, and as a cypress treeupon the mountains of Hermon.   

{24:14} I was exalted like a palm tree in En-gaddi, and as a roseplant in Jericho, as a fair olive tree in a pleasant field, and grew upas a plane tree by the water.   

{24:15} I gave a sweet smell like cinnamon and aspalathus, and Iyielded a pleasant odour like the best myrrh, as galbanum, and onyx,and sweet storax, and as the fume of frankincense in the tabernacle.   

{24:16} As the turpentine tree I stretched out my branches, and mybranches are the branches of honour and grace.   

{24:17} As the vine brought I forth pleasant savour, and my flowersare the fruit of honour and riches.   

{24:18} I am the mother of fair love, and fear, and knowledge, andholy hope: I therefore, being eternal, am given to all my childrenwhich are named of him.   

{24:19} Come unto me, all ye that be desirous of me, and fillyourselves with my fruits.   

{24:20} For my memorial is sweeter than honey, and mine inheritancethan the honeycomb.   

{24:21} They that eat me shall yet be hungry, and they that drink meshall yet be thirsty.   

{24:22} He that obeyeth me shall never be confounded, and they thatwork by me shall not do amiss.   

{24:23} All these things are the book of the covenant of the mosthigh God, even the law which Moses commanded for an heritage unto thecongregations of Jacob.   

{24:24} Faint not to be strong in the Lord; that he may confirm you,cleave unto him: for the Lord Almighty is God alone, and beside himthere is no other Saviour.   

{24:25} He filleth all things with his wisdom, as Phison and asTigris in the time of the new fruits.   

{24:26} He maketh the understanding to abound like Euphrates, and asJordan in the time of the harvest.   

{24:27} He maketh the doctrine of knowledge appear as the light, andas Geon in the time of vintage.   

{24:28} The first man knew her not perfectly: no more shall the lastfind her out.   

{24:29} For her thoughts are more than the sea, and her counselsprofounder than the great deep.   

{24:30} I also came out as a brook from a river, and as a conduitinto a garden.   

{24:31} I said, I will water my best garden, and will waterabundantly my garden bed: and, lo, my brook became a river, and myriver became a sea.   

{24:32} I will yet make doctrine to shine as the morning, and willsend forth her light afar off.   

{24:33} I will yet pour out doctrine as prophecy, and leave it toall ages for ever.   

{24:34} Behold that I have not laboured for myself only, but for allthem that seek wisdom.   

{25:1} In three things I was beautified, and stood up beautiful bothbefore God and men: the unity of brethren, the love of neighbours, aman and a wife that agree together.   

{25:2} Three sorts of men my soul hateth, and I am greatly offendedat their life: a poor man that is proud, a rich man that is a liar, andan old adulterer that doateth.   

{25:3} If thou hast gathered nothing in thy youth, how canst thoufind any thing in thine age?   

{25:4} O how comely a thing is judgment for gray hairs, and forancient men to know counsel!   

{25:5} O how comely is the wisdom of old men, and understanding andcounsel to men of honour.   

{25:6} Much experience is the crown of old men, and the fear of Godis their glory.   

{25:7} There be nine things which I have judged in mine heart to behappy, and the tenth I will utter with my tongue: A man that hath joyof his children; and he that liveth to see the fall of his enemy:   

{25:8} Well is him that dwelleth with a wife of understanding, andthat hath not slipped with his tongue, and that hath not served a manmore unworthy than himself:   

{25:9} Well is him that hath found prudence, and he that speaketh inthe ears of them that will hear:   

{25:10} O how great is he that findeth wisdom! yet is there noneabove him that feareth the Lord.   

{25:11} But the love of the Lord passeth all things forillumination: he that holdeth it, whereto shall he be likened?   

{25:12} The fear of the Lord is the beginning of his love: and faithis the beginning of cleaving unto him.   

{25:13} [Give me] any plague, but the plague of the heart: and anywickedness, but the wickedness of a woman:   

{25:14} And any affliction, but the affliction from them that hateme: and any revenge, but the revenge of enemies.   

{25:15} There is no head above the head of a serpent; and there isno wrath above the wrath of an enemy.   

{25:16} I had rather dwell with a lion and a dragon, than to keephouse with a wicked woman.   

{25:17} The wickedness of a woman changeth her face, and darkenethher countenance like sackcloth.   

{25:18} Her husband shall sit among his neighbours; and when heheareth it shall sigh bitterly.   

{25:19} All wickedness is but little to the wickedness of a woman:let the portion of a sinner fall upon her.   

{25:20} As the climbing up a sandy way is to the feet of the aged,so is a wife full of words to a quiet man.   

{25:21} Stumble not at the beauty of a woman, and desire her not forpleasure.   

{25:22} A woman, if she maintain her husband, is full of anger,impudence, and much reproach.   

{25:23} A wicked woman abateth the courage, maketh an heavycountenance and a wounded heart: a woman that will not comfort herhusband in distress maketh weak hands and feeble knees.   

{25:24} Of the woman came the beginning of sin, and through her weall die.   

{25:25} Give the water no passage; neither a wicked woman liberty togad abroad.   

{25:26} If she go not as thou wouldest have her, cut her off fromthy flesh, and give her a bill of divorce, and let her go.   

{26:1} Blessed is the man that hath a virtuous wife, for the numberof his days shall be double.   

{26:2} A virtuous woman rejoiceth her husband, and he shall fulfilthe years of his life in peace.   

{26:3} A good wife is a good portion, which shall be given in theportion of them that fear the Lord.   

{26:4} Whether a man be rich or poor, if he have a good heart towardthe Lord, he shall at all times rejoice with a cheerful countenance.   

{26:5} There be three things that mine heart feareth; and for thefourth I was sore afraid: the slander of a city, the gathering togetherof an unruly multitude, and a false accusation: all these are worsethan death.   

{26:6} But a grief of heart and sorrow is a woman that is jealousover another woman, and a scourge of the tongue which communicatethwith all.   

{26:7} An evil wife is a yoke shaken to and fro: he that hath holdof her is as though he held a scorpion.   

{26:8} A drunken woman and a gadder abroad causeth great anger, andshe will not cover her own shame.   

{26:9} The whoredom of a woman may be known in her haughty looks andeyelids.   

{26:10} If thy daughter be shameless, keep her in straitly, lest sheabuse herself through overmuch liberty.   

{26:11} Watch over an impudent eye: and marvel not if she trespassagainst thee.   

{26:12} She will open her mouth, as a thirsty traveller when he hathfound a fountain, and drink of every water near her: by every hedgewill she sit down, and open her quiver against every arrow.   

{26:13} The grace of a wife delighteth her husband, and herdiscretion will fatten his bones.   

{26:14} A silent and loving woman is a gift of the Lord; and thereis nothing so much worth as a mind well instructed.   

{26:15} A shamefaced and faithful woman is a double grace, and hercontinent mind cannot be valued.   

{26:16} As the sun when it ariseth in the high heaven; so is thebeauty of a good wife in the ordering of her house.   

{26:17} As the clear light is upon the holy candlestick; so is thebeauty of the face in ripe age.   

{26:18} As the golden pillars are upon the sockets of silver; so arethe fair feet with a constant heart.   

{26:19} My son, keep the flower of thine age sound; and give not thystrength to strangers.   

{26:20} When thou hast gotten a fruitful possession through all thefield, sow it with thine own seed, trusting in the goodness of thystock.   

{26:21} So thy race which thou leavest shall be magnified, havingthe confidence of their good descent.   

{26:22} An harlot shall be accounted as spittle; but a married womanis a tower against death to her husband.   

{26:23} A wicked woman is given as a portion to a wicked man: but agodly woman is given to him that feareth the Lord.   

{26:24} A dishonest woman contemneth shame: but an honest woman willreverence her husband.   

{26:25} A shameless woman shall be counted as a dog; but she that isshamefaced will fear the Lord.   

{26:26} A woman that honoureth her husband shall be judged wise ofall; but she that dishonoureth him in her pride shall be countedungodly of all.   

{26:27} A loud crying woman and a scold shall be sought out to driveaway the enemies.   

{26:28} There be two things that grieve my heart; and the thirdmaketh me angry: a man of war that suffereth poverty; and men ofunderstanding that are not set by; and one that returneth fromrighteousness to sin; the Lord prepareth such an one for the sword.   

{26:29} A merchant shall hardly keep himself from doing wrong; andan huckster shall not be freed from sin.   

{27:1} Many have sinned for a small matter; and he that seeketh forabundance will turn his eyes away.   

{27:2} As a nail sticketh fast between the joinings of the stones;so doth sin stick close between buying and selling.   

{27:3} Unless a man hold himself diligently in the fear of the Lord,his house shall soon be overthrown.   

{27:4} As when one sifteth with a sieve, the refuse remaineth; sothe filth of man in his talk.   

{27:5} The furnace proveth the potter's vessels; so the trial of manis in his reasoning.   

{27:6} The fruit declareth if the tree have been dressed; so is theutterance of a conceit in the heart of man.   

{27:7} Praise no man before thou hearest him speak; for this is thetrial of men.   

{27:8} If thou followest righteousness, thou shalt obtain her, andput her on, as a glorious long robe.   

{27:9} The birds will resort unto their like; so will truth returnunto them that practise in her.   

{27:10} As the lion lieth in wait for the prey; so sin for them thatwork iniquity.   

{27:11} The discourse of a godly man is always with wisdom; but afool changeth as the moon.   

{27:12} If thou be among the indiscreet, observe the time; but becontinually among men of understanding.   

{27:13} The discourse of fools is irksome, and their sport is thewantonness of sin.   

{27:14} The talk of him that sweareth much maketh the hair standupright; and their brawls make one stop his ears.   

{27:15} The strife of the proud is bloodshedding, and theirrevilings are grievous to the ear.   

{27:16} Whoso discovereth secrets loseth his credit; and shall neverfind friend to his mind.   

{27:17} Love thy friend, and be faithful unto him: but if thoubetrayest his secrets, follow no more after him.   

{27:18} For as a man hath destroyed his enemy; so hast thou lost thelove of thy neighbor.   

{27:19} As one that letteth a bird go out of his hand, so hast thoulet thy neighbour go, and shalt not get him again   

{27:20} Follow after him no more, for he is too far off; he is as aroe escaped out of the snare.   

{27:21} As for a wound, it may be bound up; and after reviling theremay be reconcilement: but he that betrayeth secrets is without hope.   

{27:22} He that winketh with the eyes worketh evil: and he thatknoweth him will depart from him.   

{27:23} When thou art present, he will speak sweetly, and willadmire thy words: but at the last he will writhe his mouth, and slanderthy sayings.   

{27:24} I have hated many things, but nothing like him; for the Lordwill hate him.   

{27:25} Whoso casteth a stone on high casteth it on his own head;and a deceitful stroke shall make wounds.   

{27:26} Whoso diggeth a pit shall fall therein: and he that settetha trap shall be taken therein.   

{27:27} He that worketh mischief, it shall fall upon him, and heshall not know whence it cometh.   

{27:28} Mockery and reproach are from the proud; but vengeance, as alion, shall lie in wait for them.   

{27:29} They that rejoice at the fall of the righteous shall betaken in the snare; and anguish shall consume them before they die.   

{27:30} Malice and wrath, even these are abominations; and thesinful man shall have them both.   

{28:1} He that revengeth shall find vengeance from the Lord, and hewill surely keep his sins [in remembrance.]   

{28:2} Forgive thy neighbour the hurt that he hath done unto thee,so shall thy sins also be forgiven when thou prayest.   

{28:3} One man beareth hatred against another, and doth he seekpardon from the Lord?   

{28:4} He sheweth no mercy to a man, which is like himself: and dothhe ask forgiveness of his own sins?   

{28:5} If he that is but flesh nourish hatred, who will intreat forpardon of his sins?   

{28:6} Remember thy end, and let enmity cease; [remember] corruptionand death, and abide in the commandments.   

{28:7} Remember the commandments, and bear no malice to thyneighbour: [remember] the covenant of the Highest, and wink atignorance.   

{28:8} Abstain from strife, and thou shalt diminish thy sins: for afurious man will kindle strife,   

{28:9} A sinful man disquieteth friends, and maketh debate amongthem that be at peace.   

{28:10} As the matter of the fire is, so it burneth: and as a man'sstrength is, so is his wrath; and according to his riches his angerriseth; and the stronger they are which contend, the more they will beinflamed.   

{28:11} An hasty contention kindleth a fire: and an hasty fightingsheddeth blood.   

{28:12} If thou blow the spark, it shall burn: if thou spit upon it,it shall be quenched: and both these come out of thy mouth.   

{28:13} Curse the whisperer and doubletongued: for such havedestroyed many that were at peace.   

{28:14} A backbiting tongue hath disquieted many, and driven themfrom nation to nation: strong cities hath it pulled down, andoverthrown the houses of great men.   

{28:15} A backbiting tongue hath cast out virtuous women, anddeprived them of their labours.   

{28:16} Whoso hearkeneth unto it shall never find rest, and neverdwell quietly.   

{28:17} The stroke of the whip maketh marks in the flesh: but thestroke of the tongue breaketh the bones.   

{28:18} Many have fallen by the edge of the sword: but not so manyas have fallen by the tongue.   

{28:19} Well is he that is defended through the venom thereof; whohath not drawn the yoke thereof, nor hath been bound in her bands.   

{28:20} For the yoke thereof is a yoke of iron, and the bandsthereof are bands of brass.   

{28:21} The death thereof is an evil death, the grave were betterthan it.   

{28:22} It shall not have rule over them that fear God, neithershall they be burned with the flame thereof.   

{28:23} Such as forsake the Lord shall fall into it; and it shallburn in them, and not be quenched; it shall be sent upon them as alion, and devour them as a leopard.   

{28:24} Look that thou hedge thy possession about with thorns, andbind up thy silver and gold,   

{28:25} And weigh thy words in a balance, and make a door and barfor thy mouth.   

{28:26} Beware thou slide not by it, lest thou fall before him thatlieth in wait.   

{29:1} He that is merciful will lend unto his neighbour; and he thatstrengtheneth his hand keepeth the commandments.   

{29:2} Lend to thy neighbour in time of his need, and pay thou thyneighbour again in due season.   

{29:3} Keep thy word, and deal faithfully with him, and thou shaltalways find the thing that is necessary for thee.   

{29:4} Many, when a thing was lent them, reckoned it to be found,and put them to trouble that helped them.   

{29:5} Till he hath received, he will kiss a man's hand; and for hisneighbour's money he will speak submissly: but when he should repay, hewill prolong the time, and return words of grief, and complain of thetime.   

{29:6} If he prevail, he shall hardly receive the half, and he willcount as if he had found it: if not, he hath deprived him of his money,and he hath gotten him an enemy without cause: he payeth him withcursings and railings; and for honour he will pay him disgrace.   

{29:7} Many therefore have refused to lend for other men's illdealing, fearing to be defrauded.   

{29:8} Yet have thou patience with a man in poor estate, and delaynot to shew him mercy.   

{29:9} Help the poor for the commandment's sake, and turn him notaway because of his poverty.   

{29:10} Lose thy money for thy brother and thy friend, and let itnot rust under a stone to be lost.   

{29:11} Lay up thy treasure according to the commandments of themost High, and it shall bring thee more profit than gold.   

{29:12} Shut up alms in thy storehouses: and it shall deliver theefrom all affliction.   

{29:13} It shall fight for thee against thine enemies better than amighty shield and strong spear.   

{29:14} An honest man is surety for his neighbour: but he that isimpudent will forsake him.   

{29:15} Forget not the friendship of thy surety, for he hath givenhis life for thee.   

{29:16} A sinner will overthrow the good estate of his surety:   

{29:17} And he that is of an unthankful mind will leave him [indanger] that delivered him.   

{29:18} Suretiship hath undone many of good estate, and shaken themas a wave of the sea: mighty men hath it driven from their houses, sothat they wandered among strange nations.   

{29:19} A wicked man transgressing the commandments of the Lordshall fall into suretiship: and he that undertaketh and followeth othermen's business for gain shall fall into suits.   

{29:20} Help thy neighbour according to thy power, and beware thatthou thyself fall not into the same.   

{29:21} The chief thing for life is water, and bread, and clothing,and an house to cover shame.   

{29:22} Better is the life of a poor man in a mean cottage, thandelicate fare in another man's house.   

{29:23} Be it little or much, hold thee contented, that thou hearnot the reproach of thy house.   

{29:24} For it is a miserable life to go from house to house: forwhere thou art a stranger, thou darest not open thy mouth.   

{29:25} Thou shalt entertain, and feast, and have no thanks:moreover thou shalt hear bitter words:   

{29:26} Come, thou stranger, and furnish a table, and feed me ofthat thou hast ready.   

{29:27} Give place, thou stranger, to an honourable man; my brothercometh to be lodged, and I have need of mine house.   

{29:28} These things are grievous to a man of understanding; theupbraiding of houseroom, and reproaching of the lender.   

{30:1} He that loveth his son causeth him oft to feel the rod, thathe may have joy of him in the end.   

{30:2} He that chastiseth his son shall have joy in him, and shallrejoice of him among his acquaintance.   

{30:3} He that teacheth his son grieveth the enemy: and before hisfriends he shall rejoice of him.   

{30:4} Though his father die, yet he is as though he were not dead:for he hath left one behind him that is like himself.   

{30:5} While he lived, he saw and rejoiced in him: and when he died,he was not sorrowful.   

{30:6} He left behind him an avenger against his enemies, and onethat shall requite kindness to his friends.   

{30:7} He that maketh too much of his son shall bind up his wounds;and his bowels will be troubled at every cry.   

{30:8} An horse not broken becometh headstrong: and a child left tohimself will be wilful.   

{30:9} Cocker thy child, and he shall make thee afraid: play withhim, and he will bring thee to heaviness.   

{30:10} Laugh not with him, lest thou have sorrow with him, and lestthou gnash thy teeth in the end.   

{30:11} Give him no liberty in his youth, and wink not at hisfollies.   

{30:12} Bow down his neck while he is young, and beat him on thesides while he is a child, lest he wax stubborn, and be disobedientunto thee, and so bring sorrow to thine heart.   

{30:13} Chastise thy son, and hold him to labour, lest his lewdbehaviour be an offence unto thee.   

{30:14} Better is the poor, being sound and strong of constitution,than a rich man that is afflicted in his body.   

{30:15} Health and good estate of body are above all gold, and astrong body above infinite wealth.   

{30:16} There is no riches above a sound body, and no joy above thejoy of the heart.   

{30:17} Death is better than a bitter life or continual sickness.   

{30:18} Delicates poured upon a mouth shut up are as messes of meatset upon a grave.   

{30:19} What good doeth the offering unto an idol? for neither canit eat nor smell: so is he that is persecuted of the Lord.   

{30:20} He seeth with his eyes and groaneth, as an eunuch thatembraceth a virgin and sigheth.   

{30:21} Give not over thy mind to heaviness, and afflict not thyselfin thine own counsel.   

{30:22} The gladness of the heart is the life of man, and thejoyfulness of a man prolongeth his days.   

{30:23} Love thine own soul, and comfort thy heart, remove sorrowfar from thee: for sorrow hath killed many, and there is no profittherein.   

{30:24} Envy and wrath shorten the life, and carefulness bringethage before the time.   

{30:25} A cheerful and good heart will have a care of his meat anddiet.   

{31:1} Watching for riches consumeth the flesh, and the care thereofdriveth away sleep.   

{31:2} Watching care will not let a man slumber, as a sore diseasebreaketh sleep,   

{31:3} The rich hath great labour in gathering riches together; andwhen he resteth, he is filled with his delicates.   

{31:4} The poor laboureth in his poor estate; and when he leavethoff, he is still needy.   

{31:5} He that loveth gold shall not be justified, and he thatfolloweth corruption shall have enough thereof.   

{31:6} Gold hath been the ruin of many, and their destruction waspresent.   

{31:7} It is a stumblingblock unto them that sacrifice unto it, andevery fool shall be taken therewith.   

{31:8} Blessed is the rich that is found without blemish, and hathnot gone after gold.   

{31:9} Who is he? and we will call him blessed: for wonderful thingshath he done among his people.   

{31:10} Who hath been tried thereby, and found perfect? then let himglory. Who might offend, and hath not offended? or done evil, and hathnot done it?   

{31:11} His goods shall be established, and the congregation shalldeclare his alms.   

{31:12} If thou sit at a bountiful table, be not greedy upon it, andsay not, There is much meat on it.   

{31:13} Remember that a wicked eye is an evil thing: and what iscreated more wicked than an eye? therefore it weepeth upon everyoccasion.   

{31:14} Stretch not thine hand whithersoever it looketh, and thrustit not with him into the dish.   

{31:15} Judge not thy neighbour by thyself: and be discreet in everypoint.   

{31:16} Eat as it becometh a man, those things which are set beforethee; and devour note, lest thou be hated.   

{31:17} Leave off first for manners' sake; and be not unsatiable,lest thou offend.   

{31:18} When thou sittest among many, reach not thine hand out firstof all.   

{31:19} A very little is sufficient for a man well nurtured, and hefetcheth not his wind short upon his bed.   

{31:20} Sound sleep cometh of moderate eating: he riseth early, andhis wits are with him: but the pain of watching, and choler, and pangsof the belly, are with an unsatiable man.   

{31:21} And if thou hast been forced to eat, arise, go forth, vomit,and thou shalt have rest.   

{31:22} My son, hear me, and despise me not, and at the last thoushalt find as I told thee: in all thy works be quick, so shall there nosickness come unto thee.   

{31:23} Whoso is liberal of his meat, men shall speak well of him;and the report of his good housekeeping will be believed.   

{31:24} But against him that is a niggard of his meat the whole cityshall murmur; and the testimonies of his niggardness shall not bedoubted of.   

{31:25} Shew not thy valiantness in wine; for wine hath destroyedmany.   

{31:26} The furnace proveth the edge by dipping: so doth wine thehearts of the proud by drunkeness.   

{31:27} Wine is as good as life to a man, if it be drunk moderately:what life is then to a man that is without wine? for it was made tomake men glad.   

{31:28} Wine measurably drunk and in season bringeth gladness of theheart, and cheerfulness of the mind:   

{31:29} But wine drunken with excess maketh bitterness of the mind,with brawling and quarrelling.   

{31:30} Drunkenness increaseth the rage of a fool till he offend: itdiminisheth strength, and maketh wounds.   

{31:31} Rebuke not thy neighbour at the wine, and despise him not inhis mirth: give him no despiteful words, and press not upon him withurging him [to drink.]   

{32:1} If thou be made the master [of a feast,] lift not thyself up,but be among them as one of the rest; take diligent care for them, andso sit down.   

{32:2} And when thou hast done all thy office, take thy place, thatthou mayest be merry with them, and receive a crown for thy wellordering of the feast.   

{32:3} Speak, thou that art the elder, for it becometh thee, butwith sound judgment; and hinder not musick.   

{32:4} Pour not out words where there is a musician, and shew notforth wisdom out of time.   

{32:5} A concert of musick in a banquet of wine is as a signet ofcarbuncle set in gold.   

{32:6} As a signet of an emerald set in a work of gold, so is themelody of musick with pleasant wine.   

{32:7} Speak, young man, if there be need of thee: and yet scarcelywhen thou art twice asked.   

{32:8} Let thy speech be short, comprehending much in few words; beas one that knoweth and yet holdeth his tongue.   

{32:9} If thou be among great men, make not thyself equal with them;and when ancient men are in place, use not many words.   

{32:10} Before the thunder goeth lightning; and before a shamefacedman shall go favour.   

{32:11} Rise up betimes, and be not the last; but get thee homewithout delay.   

{32:12} There take thy pastime, and do what thou wilt: but sin notby proud speech.   

{32:13} And for these things bless him that made thee, and hathreplenished thee with his good things.   

{32:14} Whoso feareth the Lord will receive his discipline; and theythat seek him early shall find favour.   

{32:15} He that seeketh the law shall be filled therewith: but thehypocrite will be offended thereat.   

{32:16} They that fear the Lord shall find judgment, and shallkindle justice as a light.   

{32:17} A sinful man will not be reproved, but findeth an excuseaccording to his will.   

{32:18} A man of counsel will be considerate; but a strange andproud man is not daunted with fear, even when of himself he hath donewithout counsel.   

{32:19} Do nothing without advice; and when thou hast once done,repent not.   

{32:20} Go not in a way wherein thou mayest fall, and stumble notamong the stones.   

{32:21} Be not confident in a plain way.   

{32:22} And beware of thine own children.   

{32:23} In every good work trust thy own soul; for this is thekeeping of the commandments.   

{32:24} He that believeth in the Lord taketh heed to thecommandment; and he that trusteth in him shall fare never the worse.   

{33:1} There shall no evil happen unto him that feareth the Lord;but in temptation even again he will deliver him.   

{33:2} A wise man hateth not the law; but he that is an hypocritetherein is as a ship in a storm.   

{33:3} A man of understanding trusteth in the law; and the law isfaithful unto him, as an oracle.   

{33:4} Prepare what to say, and so thou shalt be heard: and bind upinstruction, and then make answer.   

{33:5} The heart of the foolish is like a cartwheel; and histhoughts are like a rolling axletree.   

{33:6} A stallion horse is as a mocking friend, he neigheth underevery one that sitteth upon him.   

{33:7} Why doth one day excel another, when as all the light ofevery day in the year is of the sun?   

{33:8} By the knowledge of the Lord they were distinguished: and healtered seasons and feasts.   

{33:9} Some of them hath he made high days, and hallowed them, andsome of them hath he made ordinary days.   

{33:10} And all men are from the ground, and Adam was created ofearth:   

{33:11} In much knowledge the Lord hath divided them, and made theirways diverse.   

{33:12} Some of them hath he blessed and exalted and some of them hesanctified, and set near himself: but some of them hath he cursed andbrought low, and turned out of their places.   

{33:13} As the clay is in the potter's hand, to fashion it at hispleasure: so man is in the hand of him that made him, to render to themas liketh him best.   

{33:14} Good is set against evil, and life against death: so is thegodly against the sinner, and the sinner against the godly.   

{33:15} So look upon all the works of the most High; and there aretwo and two, one against another.   

{33:16} I awaked up last of all, as one that gathereth after thegrapegatherers: by the blessing of the Lord I profited, and tred mywinepress like a gatherer of grapes.   

{33:17} Consider that I laboured not for myself only, but for allthem that seek learning.   

{33:18} Hear me, O ye great men of the people, and hearken with yourears, ye rulers of the congregation.   

{33:19} Give not thy son and wife, thy brother and friend, powerover thee while thou livest, and give not thy goods to another: lest itrepent thee, and thou intreat for the same again.   

{33:20} As long as thou livest and hast breath in thee, give notthyself over to any.   

{33:21} For better it is that thy children should seek to thee, thanthat thou shouldest stand to their courtesy.   

{33:22} In all thy works keep to thyself the preeminence; leave nota stain in thine honour.   

{33:23} At the time when thou shalt end thy days, and finish thylife, distribute thine inheritance.   

{33:24} Fodder, a wand, and burdens, are for the ass; and bread,correction, and work, for a servant. .   

{33:25} If thou set thy servant to labour, thou shalt find rest: butif thou let him go idle, he shall seek liberty.   

{33:26} A yoke and a collar do bow the neck: so are tortures andtorments for an evil servant.   

{33:27} Send him to labour, that he be not idle; for idlenessteacheth much evil.   

{33:28} Set him to work, as is fit for him: if he be not obedient,put on more heavy fetters.   

{33:29} But be not excessive toward any; and without discretion donothing.   

{33:30} If thou have a servant, let him be unto thee as thyself,because thou hast bought him with a price.   

{33:31} If thou have a servant, entreat him as a brother: for thouhast need of him, as of thine own soul: if thou entreat him evil, andhe run from thee, which way wilt thou go to seek him?   

{34:1} The hopes of a man void of understanding are vain and false:and dreams lift up fools.   

{34:2} Whoso regardeth dreams is like him that catcheth at a shadow,and followeth after the wind.   

{34:3} The vision of dreams is the resemblance of one thing toanother, even as the likeness of a face to a face.   

{34:4} Of an unclean thing what can be cleansed? and from that thingwhich is false what truth can come?   

{34:5} Divinations, and soothsayings, and dreams, are vain: and theheart fancieth, as a woman's heart in travail.   

{34:6} If they be not sent from the most High in thy visitation, setnot thy heart upon them.   

{34:7} For dreams have deceived many, and they have failed that puttheir trust in them.   

{34:8} The law shall be found perfect without lies: and wisdom isperfection to a faithful mouth.   

{34:9} A man that hath travelled knoweth many things; and he thathath much experience will declare wisdom.   

{34:10} He that hath no experience knoweth little: but he that hathtravelled is full of prudence.   

{34:11} When I travelled, I saw many things; and I understand morethan I can express.   

{34:12} I was ofttimes in danger of death: yet I was deliveredbecause of these things.   

{34:13} The spirit of those that fear the Lord shall live; for theirhope is in him that saveth them.   

{34:14} Whoso feareth the Lord shall not fear nor be afraid; for heis his hope.   

{34:15} Blessed is the soul of him that feareth the Lord: to whomdoth he look? and who is his strength?   

{34:16} For the eyes of the Lord are upon them that love him, he istheir mighty protection and strong stay, a defence from heat, and acover from the sun at noon, a preservation from stumbling, and an helpfrom falling.   

{34:17} He raiseth up the soul, and lighteneth the eyes: he givethhealth, life, and blessing.   

{34:18} He that sacrificeth of a thing wrongfully gotten, hisoffering is ridiculous; and the gifts of unjust men are not accepted.   

{34:19} The most High is not pleased with the offerings of thewicked; neither is he pacified for sin by the multitude of sacrifices.   

{34:20} Whoso bringeth an offering of the goods of the poor doeth asone that killeth the son before his father's eyes.   

{34:21} The bread of the needy is their life: he that defraudeth himthereof is a man of blood.   

{34:22} He that taketh away his neighbour's living slayeth him; andhe that defraudeth the labourer of his hire is a bloodshedder.   

{34:23} When one buildeth, and another pulleth down, what profithave they then but labour?   

{34:24} When one prayeth, and another curseth, whose voice will theLord hear?   

{34:25} He that washeth himself after the touching of a dead body,if he touch it again, what availeth his washing?   

{34:26} So is it with a man that fasteth for his sins, and goethagain, and doeth the same: who will hear his prayer? or what doth hishumbling profit him?   

{35:1} He that keepeth the law bringeth offerings enough: he thattaketh heed to the commandment offereth a peace offering.   

{35:2} He that requiteth a goodturn offereth fine flour; and he thatgiveth alms sacrificeth praise.   

{35:3} To depart from wickedness is a thing pleasing to the Lord;and to forsake unrighteousness is a propitiation.   

{35:4} Thou shalt not appear empty before the Lord.   

{35:5} For all these things [are to be done] because of thecommandment.   

{35:6} The offering of the righteous maketh the altar fat, and thesweet savour thereof is before the most High.   

{35:7} The sacrifice of a just man is acceptable. and the memorialthereof shall never be forgotten.   

{35:8} Give the Lord his honour with a good eye, and diminish notthe firstfruits of thine hands.   

{35:9} In all thy gifts shew a cheerful countenance, and dedicatethy tithes with gladness.   

{35:10} Give unto the most High according as he hath enriched thee;and as thou hast gotten, give with a cheerful eye.   

{35:11} For the Lord recompenseth, and will give thee seven times asmuch.   

{35:12} Do not think to corrupt with gifts; for such he will notreceive: and trust not to unrighteous sacrifices; for the Lord isjudge, and with him is no respect of persons.   

{35:13} He will not accept any person against a poor man, but willhear the prayer of the oppressed.   

{35:14} He will not despise the supplication of the fatherless; northe widow, when she poureth out her complaint.   

{35:15} Do not the tears run down the widow's cheeks? and is not hercry against him that causeth them to fall?   

{35:16} He that serveth the Lord shall be accepted with favour, andhis prayer shall reach unto the clouds.   

{35:17} The prayer of the humble pierceth the clouds: and till itcome nigh, he will not be comforted; and will not depart, till the mostHigh shall behold to judge righteously, and execute judgment.   

{35:18} For the Lord will not be slack, neither will the Mighty bepatient toward them, till he have smitten in sunder the loins of theunmerciful, and repayed vengeance to the heathen; till he have takenaway the multitude of the proud, and broken the sceptre of theunrighteous;   

{35:19} Till he have rendered to every man according to his deeds,and to the works of men according to their devices; till he have judgedthe cause of his people, and made them to rejoice in his mercy.   

{35:20} Mercy is seasonable in the time of affliction, as clouds ofrain in the time of drought.   

{36:1} Have mercy upon us, O Lord God of all, and behold us:   

{36:2} And send thy fear upon all the nations that seek not afterthee.   

{36:3} Lift up thy hand against the strange nations, and let themsee thy power.   

{36:4} As thou wast sanctified in us before them: so be thoumagnified among them before us.   

{36:5} And let them know thee, as we have known thee, that there isno God but only thou, O God.   

{36:6} Shew new signs, and make other strange wonders: glorify thyhand and thy right arm, that they may set forth thy wondrous works.   

{36:7} Raise up indignation, and pour out wrath: take away theadversary, and destroy the enemy.   

{36:8} Sake the time short, remember the covenant, and let themdeclare thy wonderful works.   

{36:9} Let him that escapeth be consumed by the rage of the fire;and let them perish that oppress the people.   

{36:10} Smite in sunder the heads of the rulers of the heathen, thatsay, There is none other but we.   

{36:11} Gather all the tribes of Jacob together, and inherit thouthem, as from the beginning.   

{36:12} O Lord, have mercy upon the people that is called by thyname, and upon Israel, whom thou hast named thy firstborn.   

{36:13} O be merciful unto Jerusalem, thy holy city, the place ofthy rest.   

{36:14} Fill Sion with thine unspeakable oracles, and thy peoplewith thy glory:   

{36:15} Give testimony unto those that thou hast possessed from thebeginning, and raise up prophets that have been in thy name.   

{36:16} Reward them that wait for thee, and let thy prophets befound faithful.   

{36:17} O Lord, hear the prayer of thy servants, according to theblessing of Aaron over thy people, that all they which dwell upon theearth may know that thou art the Lord, the eternal God.   

{36:18} The belly devoureth all meats, yet is one meat better thananother.   

{36:19} As the palate tasteth divers kinds of venison: so doth anheart of understanding false speeches.   

{36:20} A froward heart causeth heaviness: but a man of experiencewill recompense him.   

{36:21} A woman will receive every man, yet is one daughter betterthan another.   

{36:22} The beauty of a woman cheereth the countenance, and a manloveth nothing better.   

{36:23} If there be kindness, meekness, and comfort, in her tongue,then is not her husband like other men.   

{36:24} He that getteth a wife beginneth a possession, a help likeunto himself, and a pillar of rest.   

{36:25} Where no hedge is, there the possession is spoiled: and hethat hath no wife will wander up and down mourning.   

{36:26} Who will trust a thief well appointed, that skippeth fromcity to city? so [who will believe] a man that hath no house, andlodgeth wheresoever the night taketh him?   

{37:1} Every friend saith, I am his friend also: but there is afriend, which is only a friend in name.   

{37:2} Is it not a grief unto death, when a companion and friend isturned to an enemy?   

{37:3} O wicked imagination, whence camest thou in to cover theearth with deceit?   

{37:4} There is a companion, which rejoiceth in the prosperity of afriend, but in the time of trouble will be against him.   

{37:5} There is a companion, which helpeth his friend for the belly,and taketh up the buckler against the enemy.   

{37:6} Forget not thy friend in thy mind, and be not unmindful ofhim in thy riches.   

{37:7} Every counsellor extolleth counsel; but there is some thatcounselleth for himself.   

{37:8} Beware of a counsellor, and know before what need he hath;for he will counsel for himself; lest he cast the lot upon thee,   

{37:9} And say unto thee, Thy way is good: and afterward he stand onthe other side, to see what shall befall thee.   

{37:10} Consult not with one that suspecteth thee: and hide thycounsel from such as envy thee.   

{37:11} Neither consult with a woman touching her of whom she isjealous; neither with a coward in matters of war; nor with a merchantconcerning exchange; nor with a buyer of selling; nor with an enviousman of thankfulness; nor with an unmerciful man touching kindness; norwith the slothful for any work; nor with an hireling for a year offinishing work; nor with an idle servant of much business: hearken notunto these in any matter of counsel.   

{37:12} But be continually with a godly man, whom thou knowest tokeep the commandments of the Lord, whose, mind is according to thymind, and will sorrow with thee, if thou shalt miscarry.   

{37:13} And let the counsel of thine own heart stand: for there isno man more faithful unto thee than it.   

{37:14} For a man's mind is sometime wont to tell him more thanseven watchmen, that sit above in an high tower.   

{37:15} And above all this pray to the most High, that he willdirect thy way in truth.   

{37:16} Let reason go before every enterprize, and counsel beforeevery action.   

{37:17} The countenance is a sign of changing of the heart.   

{37:18} Four manner of things appear: good and evil, life and death:but the tongue ruleth over them continually.   

{37:19} There is one that is wise and teacheth many, and yet isunprofitable to himself.   

{37:20} There is one that sheweth wisdom in words, and is hated: heshall be destitute of all food.   

{37:21} For grace is not given, him from the Lord, because he isdeprived of all wisdom.   

{37:22} Another is wise to himself; and the fruits of understandingare commendable in his mouth.   

{37:23} A wise man instructeth his people; and the fruits of hisunderstanding fail not.   

{37:24} A wise man shall be filled with blessing; and all they thatsee him shall count him happy.   

{37:25} The days of the life of man may be numbered: but the days ofIsrael are innumerable.   

{37:26} A wise man shall inherit glory among his people, and hisname shall be perpetual.   

{37:27} My son, prove thy soul in thy life, and see what is evil forit, and give not that unto it.   

{37:28} For all things are not profitable for all men, neither hathevery soul pleasure in every thing.   

{37:29} Be not unsatiable in any dainty thing, nor too greedy uponmeats:   

{37:30} For excess of meats bringeth sickness, and surfeiting willturn into choler.   

{37:31} By surfeiting have many perished; but he that taketh heedprolongeth his life.   

{38:1} Honour a physician with the honour due unto him for the useswhich ye may have of him: for the Lord hath created him.   

{38:2} For of the most High cometh healing, and he shall receivehonour of the king.   

{38:3} The skill of the physician shall lift up his head: and in thesight of great men he shall be in admiration.   

{38:4} The Lord hath created medicines out of the earth; and he thatis wise will not abhor them.   

{38:5} Was not the water made sweet with wood, that the virtuethereof might be known?   

{38:6} And he hath given men skill, that he might be honoured in hismarvellous works.   

{38:7} With such doth he heal [men,] and taketh away their pains.   

{38:8} Of such doth the apothecary make a confection; and of hisworks there is no end; and from him is peace over all the earth,   

{38:9} My son, in thy sickness be not negligent: but pray unto theLord, and he will make thee whole.   

{38:10} Leave off from sin, and order thine hands aright, andcleanse thy heart from all wickedness.   

{38:11} Give a sweet savour, and a memorial of fine flour; and makea fat offering, as not being.   

{38:12} Then give place to the physician, for the Lord hath createdhim: let him not go from thee, for thou hast need of him.   

{38:13} There is a time when in their hands there is good success.   

{38:14} For they shall also pray unto the Lord, that he wouldprosper that, which they give for ease and remedy to prolong life.   

{38:15} He that sinneth before his Maker, let him fall into the handof the physician.   

{38:16} My son, let tears fall down over the dead, and begin tolament, as if thou hadst suffered great harm thyself; and then coverhis body according to the custom, and neglect not his burial.   

{38:17} Weep bitterly, and make great moan, and use lamentation, ashe is worthy, and that a day or two, lest thou be evil spoken of: andthen comfort thyself for thy heaviness.   

{38:18} For of heaviness cometh death, and the heaviness of theheart breaketh strength.   

{38:19} In affliction also sorrow remaineth: and the life of thepoor is the curse of the heart.   

{38:20} Take no heaviness to heart: drive it away, and member thelast end.   

{38:21} Forget it not, for there is no turning again: thou shalt notdo him good, but hurt thyself.   

{38:22} Remember my judgment: for thine also shall be so; yesterdayfor me, and to day for thee.   

{38:23} When the dead is at rest, let his remembrance rest; and becomforted for him, when his Spirit is departed from him.   

{38:24} The wisdom of a learned man cometh by opportunity ofleisure: and he that hath little business shall become wise.   

{38:25} How can he get wisdom that holdeth the plough, and thatglorieth in the goad, that driveth oxen, and is occupied in theirlabours, and whose talk is of bullocks?   

{38:26} He giveth his mind to make furrows; and is diligent to givethe kine fodder.   

{38:27} So every carpenter and workmaster, that laboureth night andday: and they that cut and grave seals, and are diligent to make greatvariety, and give themselves to counterfeit imagery, and watch tofinish a work:   

{38:28} The smith also sitting by the anvil, and considering theiron work, the vapour of the fire wasteth his flesh, and he fightethwith the heat of the furnace: the noise of the hammer and the anvil isever in his ears, and his eyes look still upon the pattern of the thingthat he maketh; he setteth his mind to finish his work, and watcheth topolish it perfectly:   

{38:29} So doth the potter sitting at his work, and turning thewheel about with his feet, who is alway carefully set at his work, andmaketh all his work by number;   

{38:30} He fashioneth the clay with his arm, and boweth down hisstrength before his feet; he applieth himself to lead it over; and heis diligent to make clean the furnace:   

{38:31} All these trust to their hands: and every one is wise in hiswork.   

{38:32} Without these cannot a city be inhabited: and they shall notdwell where they will, nor go up and down:   

{38:33} They shall not be sought for in publick counsel, nor sithigh in the congregation: they shall not sit on the judges' seat, norunderstand the sentence of judgment: they cannot declare justice andjudgment; and they shall not be found where parables are spoken.   

{38:34} But they will maintain the state of the world, and [all]their desire is in the work of their craft.   

{39:1} But he that giveth his mind to the law of the most High, andis occupied in the meditation thereof, will seek out the wisdom of allthe ancient, and be occupied in prophecies.   

{39:2} He will keep the sayings of the renowned men: and wheresubtil parables are, he will be there also.   

{39:3} He will seek out the secrets of grave sentences, and beconversant in dark parables.   

{39:4} He shall serve among great men, and appear before princes: hewill travel through strange countries; for he hath tried the good andthe evil among men.   

{39:5} He will give his heart to resort early to the Lord that madehim, and will pray before the most High, and will open his mouth inprayer, and make supplication for his sins.   

{39:6} When the great Lord will, he shall be filled with the spiritof understanding: he shall pour out wise sentences, and give thanksunto the Lord in his prayer.   

{39:7} He shall direct his counsel and knowledge, and in his secretsshall he meditate.   

{39:8} He shall shew forth that which he hath learned, and shallglory in the law of the covenant of the Lord.   

{39:9} Many shall commend his understanding; and so long as theworld endureth, it shall not be blotted out; his memorial shall notdepart away, and his name shall live from generation to generation.   

{39:10} Nations shall shew forth his wisdom, and the congregationshall declare his praise.   

{39:11} If he die, he shall leave a greater name than a thousand:and if he live, he shall increase it.   

{39:12} Yet have I more to say, which I have thought upon; for I amfilled as the moon at the full.   

{39:13} Hearken unto me, ye holy children, and bud forth as a rosegrowing by the brook of the field:   

{39:14} And give ye a sweet savour as frankincense, and flourish asa lily, send forth a smell, and sing a song of praise, bless the Lordin all his works.   

{39:15} Magnify his name, and shew forth his praise with the songsof your lips, and with harps, and in praising him ye shall say afterthis manner:   

{39:16} All the works of the Lord are exceeding good, and whatsoeverhe commandeth shall be accomplished in due season.   

{39:17} And none may say, What is this? wherefore is that? for attime convenient they shall all be sought out: at his commandment thewaters stood as an heap, and at the words of his mouth the receptaclesof waters.   

{39:18} At his commandment is done whatsoever pleaseth him; and nonecan hinder, when he will save.   

{39:19} The works of all flesh are before him, and nothing can behid from his eyes.   

{39:20} He seeth from everlasting to everlasting; and there isnothing wonderful before him.   

{39:21} A man need not to say, What is this? wherefore is that? forhe hath made all things for their uses.   

{39:22} His blessing covered the dry land as a river, and watered itas a flood.   

{39:23} As he hath turned the waters into saltness: so shall theheathen inherit his wrath.   

{39:24} As his ways are plain unto the holy; so are theystumblingblocks unto the wicked.   

{39:25} For the good are good things created from the beginning: soevil things for sinners.   

{39:26} The principal things for the whole use of man's life arewater, fire, iron, and salt, flour of wheat, honey, milk, and the bloodof the grape, and oil, and clothing.   

{39:27} All these things are for good to the godly: so to thesinners they are turned into evil.   

{39:28} There be spirits that are created for vengeance, which intheir fury lay on sore strokes; in the time of destruction they pourout their force, and appease the wrath of him that made them.   

{39:29} Fire, and hail, and famine, and death, all these werecreated for vengeance;   

{39:30} Teeth of wild beasts, and scorpions, serpents, and the swordpunishing the wicked to destruction.   

{39:31} They shall rejoice in his commandment, and they shall beready upon earth, when need is; and when their time is come, they shallnot transgress his word.   

{39:32} Therefore from the beginning I was resolved, and thoughtupon these things, and have left them in writing.   

{39:33} All the works of the Lord are good: and he will give everyneedful thing in due season.   

{39:34} So that a man cannot say, This is worse than that: for intime they shall all be well approved.   

{39:35} And therefore praise ye the Lord with the whole heart andmouth, and bless the name of the Lord.   

{40:1} Great travail is created for every man, and an heavy yoke isupon the sons of Adam, from the day that they go out of their mother'swomb, till the day that they return to the mother of all things.   

{40:2} Their imagination of things to come, and the day of death,[trouble] their thoughts, and [cause] fear of heart;   

{40:3} From him that sitteth on a throne of glory, unto him that ishumbled in earth and ashes;   

{40:4} From him that weareth purple and a crown, unto him that isclothed with a linen frock.   

{40:5} Wrath, and envy, trouble, and unquietness, fear of death, andanger, and strife, and in the time of rest upon his bed his nightsleep, do change his knowledge.   

{40:6} A little or nothing is his rest, and afterward he is in hissleep, as in a day of keeping watch, troubled in the vision of hisheart, as if he were escaped out of a battle.   

{40:7} When all is safe, he awaketh, and marvelleth that the fearwas nothing.   

{40:8} [Such things happen] unto all flesh, both man and beast, andthat is sevenfold more upon sinners.   

{40:9} Death, and bloodshed, strife, and sword, calamities, famine,tribulation, and the scourge;   

{40:10} These things are created for the wicked, and for their sakescame the flood.   

{40:11} All things that are of the earth shall turn to the earthagain: and that which is of the waters doth return into the sea.   

{40:12} All bribery and injustice shall be blotted out: but truedealing shall endure for ever.   

{40:13} The goods of the unjust shall be dried up like a river, andshall vanish with noise, like a great thunder in rain.   

{40:14} While he openeth his hand he shall rejoice: so shalltransgressors come to nought.   

{40:15} The children of the ungodly shall not bring forth manybranches: but are as unclean roots upon a hard rock.   

{40:16} The weed growing upon every water and bank of a river shallbe pulled up before all grass.   

{40:17} Bountifulness is as a most fruitful garden, and mercifulnessendureth for ever.   

{40:18} To labour, and to be content with that a man hath, is asweet life: but he that findeth a treasure is above them both.   

{40:19} Children and the building of a city continue a man's name:but a blameless wife is counted above them both.   

{40:20} Wine and musick rejoice the heart: but the love of wisdom isabove them both.   

{40:21} The pipe and the psaltery make sweet melody: but a pleasanttongue is above them both.   

{40:22} Thine eye desireth favour and beauty: but more than bothcorn while it is green.   

{40:23} A friend and companion never meet amiss: but above both is awife with her husband.   

{40:24} Brethren and help are against time of trouble: but almsshall deliver more than them both.   

{40:25} Gold and silver make the foot stand sure: but counsel isesteemed above them both.   

{40:26} Riches and strength lift up the heart: but the fear of theLord is above them both: there is no want in the fear of the Lord, andit needeth not to seek help.   

{40:27} The fear of the Lord is a fruitful garden, and covereth himabove all glory.   

{40:28} My son, lead not a beggar's life; for better it is to diethan to beg.   

{40:29} The life of him that dependeth on another man's table is notto be counted for a life; for he polluteth himself with other men'smeat: but a wise man well nurtured will beware thereof.   

{40:30} Begging is sweet in the mouth of the shameless: but in hisbelly there shall burn a fire.   

{41:1} O death, how bitter is the remembrance of thee to a man thatliveth at rest in his possessions, unto the man that hath nothing tovex him, and that hath prosperity in all things: yea, unto him that isyet able to receive meat!   

{41:2} O death, acceptable is thy sentence unto the needy, and untohim whose strength faileth, that is now in the last age, and is vexedwith all things, and to him that despaireth, and hath lost patience!   

{41:3} Fear not the sentence of death, remember them that have beenbefore thee, and that come after; for this is the sentence of the Lordover all flesh.   

{41:4} And why art thou against the pleasure of the most High? thereis no inquisition in the grave, whether thou have lived ten, or anhundred, or a thousand years.   

{41:5} The children of sinners are abominable children, and theythat are conversant in the dwelling of the ungodly.   

{41:6} The inheritance of sinners' children shall perish, and theirposterity shall have a perpetual reproach.   

{41:7} The children will complain of an ungodly father, because theyshall be reproached for his sake.   

{41:8} Woe be unto you, ungodly men, which have forsaken the law ofthe most high God! for if ye increase, it shall be to your destruction:   

{41:9} And if ye be born, ye shall be born to a curse: and if yedie, a curse shall be your portion.   

{41:10} All that are of the earth shall turn to earth again: so theungodly shall go from a curse to destruction.   

{41:11} The mourning of men is about their bodies: but an ill nameof sinners shall be blotted out.   

{41:12} Have regard to thy name; for that shall continue with theeabove a thousand great treasures of gold.   

{41:13} A good life hath but few days: but a good name endureth forever.   

{41:14} My children, keep discipline in peace: for wisdom that ishid, and a treasure that is not seen, what profit is in them both?   

{41:15} A man that hideth his foolishness is better than a man thathideth his wisdom.   

{41:16} Therefore be shamefaced according to my word: for it is notgood to retain all shamefacedness; neither is it altogether approved inevery thing.   

{41:17} Be ashamed of whoredom before father and mother: and of alie before a prince and a mighty man;   

{41:18} Of an offence before a judge and ruler; of iniquity before acongregation and people; of unjust dealing before thy partner andfriend;   

{41:19} And of theft in regard of the place where thou sojournest,and in regard of the truth of God and his covenant; and to lean withthine elbow upon the meat; and of scorning to give and take;   

{41:20} And of silence before them that salute thee; and to lookupon an harlot;   

{41:21} And to turn away thy face from thy kinsman; or to take awaya portion or a gift; or to gaze upon another man's wife.   

{41:22} Or to be overbusy with his maid, and come not near her bed;or of upbraiding speeches before friends; and after thou hast given,upbraid not;   

{41:23} Or of iterating and speaking again that which thou hastheard; and of revealing of secrets.   

{41:24} So shalt thou be truly shamefaced and find favour before allmen.   

{42:1} Of these things be not thou ashamed, and accept no person tosin thereby:   

{42:2} Of the law of the most High, and his covenant; and ofjudgment to justify the ungodly;   

{42:3} Of reckoning with thy partners and travellers; or of the giftof the heritage of friends;   

{42:4} Of exactness of balance and weights; or of getting much orlittle;   

{42:5} And of merchants' indifferent selling; of much correction ofchildren; and to make the side of an evil servant to bleed.   

{42:6} Sure keeping is good, where an evil wife is; and shut up,where many hands are.   

{42:7} Deliver all things in number and weight; and put all inwriting that thou givest out, or receivest in.   

{42:8} Be not ashamed to inform the unwise and foolish, and theextreme aged that contendeth with those that are young: thus shalt thoube truly learned, and approved of all men living.   

{42:9} The father waketh for the daughter, when no man knoweth; andthe care for her taketh away sleep: when she is young, lest she passaway the flower of her age; and being married, lest she should be hated:   

{42:10} In her virginity, lest she should be defiled and gotten withchild in her father's house; and having an husband, lest she shouldmisbehave herself; and when she is married, lest she should be barren.   

{42:11} Keep a sure watch over a shameless daughter, lest she makethee a laughingstock to thine enemies, and a byword in the city, and areproach among the people, and make thee ashamed before the multitude.   

{42:12} Behold not every body's beauty, and sit not in the midst ofwomen.   

{42:13} For from garments cometh a moth, and from women wickedness.   

{42:14} Better is the churlishness of a man than a courteous woman,a woman, I say, which bringeth shame and reproach.   

{42:15} I will now remember the works of the Lord, and declare thethings that I have seen: In the words of the Lord are his works.   

{42:16} The sun that giveth light looketh upon all things, and thework thereof is full of the glory of the Lord.   

{42:17} The Lord hath not given power to the saints to declare allhis marvellous works, which the Almighty Lord firmly settled, thatwhatsoever is might be established for his glory.   

{42:18} He seeketh out the deep, and the heart, and considereththeir crafty devices: for the Lord knoweth all that may be known, andhe beholdeth the signs of the world.   

{42:19} He declareth the things that are past, and for to come, andrevealeth the steps of hidden things.   

{42:20} No thought escapeth him, neither any word is hidden from him.   

{42:21} He hath garnished the excellent works of his wisdom, and heis from everlasting to everlasting: unto him may nothing be added,neither can he be diminished, and he hath no need of any counsellor.   

{42:22} Oh how desirable are all his works! and that a man may seeeven to a spark.   

{42:23} All these things live and remain for ever for all uses, andthey are all obedient.   

{42:24} All things are double one against another: and he hath madenothing imperfect.   

{42:25} One thing establisheth the good or another: and who shall befilled with beholding his glory?   

{43:1} The pride of the height, the clear firmament, the beauty ofheaven, with his glorious shew;   

{43:2} The sun when it appeareth, declaring at his rising amarvellous instrument, the work of the most High:   

{43:3} At noon it parcheth the country, and who can abide theburning heat thereof?   

{43:4} A man blowing a furnace is in works of heat, but the sunburneth the mountains three times more; breathing out fiery vapours,and sending forth bright beams, it dimmeth the eyes.   

{43:5} Great is the Lord that made it; and at his commandmentrunneth hastily.   

{43:6} He made the moon also to serve in her season for adeclaration of times, and a sign of the world.   

{43:7} From the moon is the sign of feasts, a light that decreasethin her perfection.   

{43:8} The month is called after her name, increasing wonderfully inher changing, being an instrument of the armies above, shining in thefirmament of heaven;   

{43:9} The beauty of heaven, the glory of the stars, an ornamentgiving light in the highest places of the Lord.   

{43:10} At the commandment of the Holy One they will stand in theirorder, and never faint in their watches.   

{43:11} Look upon the rainbow, and praise him that made it; verybeautiful it is in the brightness thereof.   

{43:12} It compasseth the heaven about with a glorious circle, andthe hands of the most High have bended it.   

{43:13} By his commandment he maketh the snow to fall aplace, andsendeth swiftly the lightnings of his judgment.   

{43:14} Through this the treasures are opened: and clouds fly forthas fowls.   

{43:15} By his great power he maketh the clouds firm, and thehailstones are broken small.   

{43:16} At his sight the mountains are shaken, and at his will thesouth wind bloweth.   

{43:17} The noise of the thunder maketh the earth to tremble: sodoth the northern storm and the whirlwind: as birds flying hescattereth the snow, and the falling down thereof is as the lighting ofgrasshoppers:   

{43:18} The eye marvelleth at the beauty of the whiteness thereof,and the heart is astonished at the raining of it.   

{43:19} The hoarfrost also as salt he poureth on the earth, andbeing congealed, it lieth on the top of sharp stakes.   

{43:20} When the cold north wind bloweth, and the water is congealedinto ice, it abideth upon every gathering together of water, andclotheth the water as with a breastplate.   

{43:21} It devoureth the mountains, and burneth the wilderness, andconsumeth the grass as fire.   

{43:22} A present remedy of all is a mist coming speedily, a dewcoming after heat refresheth.   

{43:23} By his counsel he appeaseth the deep, and planteth islandstherein.   

{43:24} They that sail on the sea tell of the danger thereof; andwhen we hear it with our ears, we marvel thereat.   

{43:25} For therein be strange and wondrous works, variety of allkinds of beasts and whales created.   

{43:26} By him the end of them hath prosperous success, and by hisword all things consist.   

{43:27} We may speak much, and yet come short: wherefore in sum, heis all.   

{43:28} How shall we be able to magnify him? for he is great aboveall his works.   

{43:29} The Lord is terrible and very great, and marvellous is hispower.   

{43:30} When ye glorify the Lord, exalt him as much as ye can; foreven yet will he far exceed: and when ye exalt him, put forth all yourstrength, and be not weary; for ye can never go far enough.   

{43:31} Who hath seen him, that he might tell us? and who canmagnify him as he is?   

{43:32} There are yet hid greater things than these be, for we haveseen but a few of his works.   

{43:33} For the Lord hath made all things; and to the godly hath hegiven wisdom.   

{44:1} Let us now praise famous men, and our fathers that begat us.   

{44:2} The Lord hath wrought great glory by them through his greatpower from the beginning.   

{44:3} Such as did bear rule in their kingdoms, men renowned fortheir power, giving counsel by their understanding, and declaringprophecies:   

{44:4} Leaders of the people by their counsels, and by theirknowledge of learning meet for the people, wise and eloquent are theirinstructions:   

{44:5} Such as found out musical tunes, and recited verses inwriting:   

{44:6} Rich men furnished with ability, living peaceably in theirhabitations:   

{44:7} All these were honoured in their generations, and were theglory of their times.   

{44:8} There be of them, that have left a name behind them, thattheir praises might be reported.   

{44:9} And some there be, which have no memorial; who are perished,as though they had never been; and are become as though they had neverbeen born; and their children after them.   

{44:10} But these were merciful men, whose righteousness hath notbeen forgotten.   

{44:11} With their seed shall continually remain a good inheritance,and their children are within the covenant.   

{44:12} Their seed standeth fast, and their children for their sakes.   

{44:13} Their seed shall remain for ever, and their glory shall notbe blotted out.   

{44:14} Their bodies are buried in peace; but their name liveth forevermore.   

{44:15} The people will tell of their wisdom, and the congregationwill shew forth their praise.   

{44:16} Enoch pleased the Lord, and was translated, being an exampleof repentance to all generations.   

{44:17} Noah was found perfect and righteous; in the time of wrathhe was taken in exchange [for the world;] therefore was he left as aremnant unto the earth, when the flood came.   

{44:18} An everlasting covenant was made with him, that all fleshshould perish no more by the flood.   

{44:19} Abraham was a great father of many people: in glory wasthere none like unto him;   

{44:20} Who kept the law of the most High, and was in covenant withhim: he established the covenant in his flesh; and when he was proved,he was found faithful.   

{44:21} Therefore he assured him by an oath, that he would bless thenations in his seed, and that he would multiply him as the dust of theearth, and exalt his seed as the stars, and cause them to inherit fromsea to sea, and from the river unto the utmost part of the land.   

{44:22} With Isaac did he establish likewise [for Abraham hisfather's sake] the blessing of all men, and the covenant, And made itrest upon the head of Jacob. He acknowledged him in his blessing, andgave him an heritage, and divided his portions; among the twelve tribesdid he part them.   

{45:1} And he brought out of him a merciful man, which found favourin the sight of all flesh, even Moses, beloved of God and men, whosememorial is blessed.   

{45:2} He made him like to the glorious saints, and magnified him,so that his enemies stood in fear of him.   

{45:3} By his words he caused the wonders to cease, and he made himglorious in the sight of kings, and gave him a commandment for hispeople, and shewed him part of his glory.   

{45:4} He sanctified him in his faithfuless and meekness, and chosehim out of all men.   

{45:5} He made him to hear his voice, and brought him into the darkcloud, and gave him commandments before his face, even the law of lifeand knowledge, that he might teach Jacob his covenants, and Israel hisjudgments.   

{45:6} He exalted Aaron, an holy man like unto him, even hisbrother, of the tribe of Levi.   

{45:7} An everlasting covenant he made with him and gave him thepriesthood among the people; he beautified him with comely ornaments,and clothed him with a robe of glory.   

{45:8} He put upon him perfect glory; and strengthened him with richgarments, with breeches, with a long robe, and the ephod.   

{45:9} And he compassed him with pomegranates, and with many goldenbells round about, that as he went there might be a sound, and a noisemade that might be heard in the temple, for a memorial to the childrenof his people;   

{45:10} With an holy garment, with gold, and blue silk, and purple,the work of the embroidere, with a breastplate of judgment, and withUrim and Thummim;   

{45:11} With twisted scarlet, the work of the cunning workman, withprecious stones graven like seals, and set in gold, the work of thejeweller, with a writing engraved for a memorial, after the number ofthe tribes of Israel.   

{45:12} He set a crown of gold upon the mitre, wherein was engravedHoliness, an ornament of honour, a costly work, the desires of theeyes, goodly and beautiful.   

{45:13} Before him there were none such, neither did ever anystranger put them on, but only his children and his children's childrenperpetually.   

{45:14} Their sacrifices shall be wholly consumed every day twicecontinually.   

{45:15} Moses consecrated him, and anointed him with holy oil: thiswas appointed unto him by an everlasting covenant, and to his seed, solong as the heavens should remain, that they should minister unto him,and execute the office of the priesthood, and bless the people in hisname.   

{45:16} He chose him out of all men living to offer sacrifices tothe Lord, incense, and a sweet savour, for a memorial, to makereconciliation for his people.   

{45:17} He gave unto him his commandments, and authority in thestatutes of judgments, that he should teach Jacob the testimonies, andinform Israel in his laws.   

{45:18} Strangers conspired together against him, and maligned himin the wilderness, even the men that were of Dathan's and Abiron'sside, and the congregation of Core, with fury and wrath.   

{45:19} This the Lord saw, and it displeased him, and in hiswrathful indignation were they consumed: he did wonders upon them, toconsume them with the fiery flame.   

{45:20} But he made Aaron more honourable, and gave him an heritage,and divided unto him the firstfruits of the increase; especially heprepared bread in abundance:   

{45:21} For they eat of the sacrifices of the Lord, which he gaveunto him and his seed.   

{45:22} Howbeit in the land of the people he had no inheritance,neither had he any portion among the people: for the Lord himself ishis portion and inheritance.   

{45:23} The third in glory is Phinees the son of Eleazar, because hehad zeal in the fear of the Lord, and stood up with good courage ofheart: when the people were turned back, and made reconciliation forIsrael.   

{45:24} Therefore was there a covenant of peace made with him, thathe should be the chief of the sanctuary and of his people, and that heand his posterity should have the dignity of the priesthood for ever:   

{45:25} According to the covenant made with David son of Jesse, ofthe tribe of Juda, that the inheritance of the king should be to hisposterity alone: so the inheritance of Aaron should also be unto hisseed.   

{45:26} God give you wisdom in your heart to judge his people inrighteousness, that their good things be not abolished, and that theirglory may endure for ever.   

{46:1} Jesus the son a Nave was valiant in the wars, and was thesuccessor of Moses in prophecies, who according to his name was madegreat for the saving of the elect of God, and taking vengeance of theenemies that rose up against them, that he might set Israel in theirinheritance.   

{46:2} How great glory gat he, when he did lift up his hands, andstretched out his sword against the cities!   

{46:3} Who before him so stood to it? for the Lord himself broughthis enemies unto him.   

{46:4} Did not the sun go back by his means? and was not one day aslong as two?   

{46:5} He called upon the most high Lord, when the enemies pressedupon him on every side; and the great Lord heard him.   

{46:6} And with hailstones of mighty power he made the battle tofall violently upon the nations, and in the descent [of Beth-horon] hedestroyed them that resisted, that the nations might know all theirstrength, because he fought in the sight of the Lord, and he followedthe Mighty One.   

{46:7} In the time of Moses also he did a work of mercy, he andCaleb the son of Jephunne, in that they withstood the congregation, andwithheld the people from sin, and appeased the wicked murmuring.   

{46:8} And of six hundred thousand people on foot, they two werepreserved to bring them in to the heritage, even unto the land thatfloweth with milk and honey.   

{46:9} The Lord gave strength also unto Caleb, which remained withhim unto his old age: so that he entered upon the high places of theland, and his seed obtained it for an heritage:   

{46:10} That all the children of Israel might see that it is good tofollow the Lord.   

{46:11} And concerning the judges, every one by name, whose heartwent not a whoring, nor departed from the Lord, let their memory beblessed.   

{46:12} Let their bones flourish out of their place, and let thename of them that were honoured be continued upon their children.   

{46:13} Samuel, the prophet of the Lord, beloved of his Lord,established a kingdom, and anointed princes over his people.   

{46:14} By the law of the Lord he judged the congregation, and theLord had respect unto Jacob.   

{46:15} By his faithfulness he was found a true prophet, and by hisword he was known to be faithful in vision.   

{46:16} He called upon the mighty Lord, when his enemies pressedupon him on every side, when he offered the sucking lamb.   

{46:17} And the Lord thundered from heaven, and with a great noisemade his voice to be heard.   

{46:18} And he destroyed the rulers of the Tyrians, and all theprinces cf the Philistines.   

{46:19} And before his long sleep he made protestations in the sightof the Lord and his anointed, I have not taken any man's goods, so muchas a shoe: and no man did accuse him.   

{46:20} And after his death he prophesied, and shewed the king hisend, and lifted up his voice from the earth in prophecy, to blot outthe wickedness of the people.   

{47:1} And after him rose up Nathan to prophesy in the time of David.   

{47:2} As is the fat taken away from the peace offering, so wasDavid chosen out of the children of Israel.   

{47:3} He played with lions as with kids, and with bears as withlambs.   

{47:4} Slew he not a giant, when he was yet but young? and did henot take away reproach from the people, when he lifted up his hand withthe stone in the sling, and beat down the boasting of Goliath?   

{47:5} For he called upon the most high Lord; and he gave himstrength in his right hand to slay that mighty warrior, and set up thehorn of his people.   

{47:6} So the people honoured him with ten thousands, and praisedhim in the blessings of the Lord, in that he gave him a crown of glory.   

{47:7} For he destroyed the enemies on every side, and brought tonought the Philistines his adversaries, and brake their horn in sunderunto this day.   

{47:8} In all his works he praised the Holy One most high with wordsof glory; with his whole heart he sung songs, and loved him that madehim.   

{47:9} He set singers also before the altar, that by their voicesthey might make sweet melody, and daily sing praises in their songs.   

{47:10} He beautified their feasts, and set in order the solemntimes until the end, that they might praise his holy name, and that thetemple might sound from morning.   

{47:11} The Lord took away his sins, and exalted his horn for ever:he gave him a covenant of kings, and a throne of glory in Israel.   

{47:12} After him rose up a wise son, and for his sake he dwelt atlarge.   

{47:13} Solomon reigned in a peaceable time, and was honoured; forGod made all quiet round about him, that he might build an house in hisname, and prepare his sanctuary for ever.   

{47:14} How wise wast thou in thy youth and, as a flood, filled withunderstanding!   

{47:15} Thy soul covered the whole earth, and thou filledst it withdark parables.   

{47:16} Thy name went far unto the islands; and for thy peace thouwast beloved.   

{47:17} The countries marvelled at thee for thy songs, and proverbs,and parables, and interpretations.   

{47:18} By the name of the Lord God, which is called the Lord God ofIsrael, thou didst gather gold as tin and didst multiply silver as lead.   

{47:19} Thou didst bow thy loins unto women, and by thy body thouwast brought into subjection.   

{47:20} Thou didst stain thy honour, and pollute thy seed: so thatthou broughtest wrath upon thy children, and wast grieved for thy folly.   

{47:21} So the kingdom was divided, and out of Ephraim ruled arebellious kingdom.   

{47:22} But the Lord will never leave off his mercy, neither shallany of his works perish, neither will he abolish the posterity of hiselect, and the seed of him that loveth him he will not take away:wherefore he gave a remnant unto Jacob, and out of him a root untoDavid.   

{47:23} Thus rested Solomon with his fathers, and of his seed heleft behind him Roboam, even the foolishness of the people, and onethat had no understanding, who turned away the people through hiscounsel. There was also Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who caused Israel tosin, and shewed Ephraim the way of sin:   

{47:24} And their sins were multiplied exceedingly, that they weredriven out of the land.   

{47:25} For they sought out all wickedness, till the vengeance cameupon them.   

{48:1} Then stood up Elias the prophet as fire, and his word burnedlike a lamp.   

{48:2} He brought a sore famine upon them, and by his zeal hediminished their number.   

{48:3} By the word of the Lord he shut up the heaven, and also threetimes brought down fire.   

{48:4} O Elias, how wast thou honoured in thy wondrous deeds! andwho may glory like unto thee!   

{48:5} Who didst raise up a dead man from death, and his soul fromthe place of the dead, by the word of the most High:   

{48:6} Who broughtest kings to destruction, and honorable men fromtheir bed:   

{48:7} Who heardest the rebuke of the Lord in Sinai, and in Horebthe judgment of vengeance:   

{48:8} Who annointedst kings to take revenge, and prophets tosucceed after him:   

{48:9} Who was taken up in a whirlwind of fire, and in a chariot offiery horses:   

{48:10} Who wast ordained for reproofs in their times, to pacify thewrath of the Lord's judgment, before it brake forth into fury, and toturn the heart of the father unto the son, and to restore the tribes ofJacob.   

{48:11} Blessed are they that saw thee, and slept in love; for weshall surely live.   

{48:12} Elias it was, who was covered with a whirlwind: and Eliseuswas filled with his spirit: whilst he lived, he was not moved with thepresence of any prince, neither could any bring him into subjection.   

{48:13} No word could overcome him; and after his death his bodyprophesied.   

{48:14} He did wonders in his life, and at his death were his worksmarvellous.   

{48:15} For all this the people repented not, neither departed theyfrom their sins, till they were spoiled and carried out of their land,and were scattered through all the earth: yet there remained a smallpeople, and a ruler in the house of David:   

{48:16} Of whom some did that which was pleasing to God, and somemultiplied sins.   

{48:17} Ezekias fortified his city, and brought in water into themidst thereof: he digged the hard rock with iron, and made wells forwaters.   

{48:18} In his time Sennacherib came up, and sent Rabsaces, andlifted up his hand against Sion, and boasted proudly.   

{48:19} Then trembled their hearts and hands, and they were in pain,as women in travail.   

{48:20} But they called upon the Lord which is merciful, andstretched out their hands toward him: and immediately the Holy Oneheard them out of heaven, and delivered them by the ministry of Esay.   

{48:21} He smote the host of the Assyrians, and his angel destroyedthem.   

{48:22} For Ezekias had done the thing that pleased the Lord, andwas strong in the ways of David his father, as Esay the prophet, whowas great and faithful in his vision, had commanded him.   

{48:23} In his time the sun went backward, and he lengthened theking's life.   

{48:24} He saw by an excellent spirit what should come to pass atthe last, and he comforted them that mourned in Sion.   

{48:25} He shewed what should come to pass for ever, and secretthings or ever they came.   

{49:1} The remembrance of Josias is like the composition of theperfume that is made by the art of the apothecary: it is sweet as honeyin all mouths, and as musick at a banquet of wine.   

{49:2} He behaved himself uprightly in the conversion of the people,and took away the abominations of iniquity.   

{49:3} He directed his heart unto the Lord, and in the time of theungodly he established the worship of God.   

{49:4} All, except David and Ezekias and Josias, were defective: forthey forsook the law of the most High, even the kings of Juda failed.   

{49:5} Therefore he gave their power unto others, and their glory toa strange nation.   

{49:6} They burnt the chosen city of the sanctuary, and made thestreets desolate, according to the prophecy of Jeremias.   

{49:7} For they entreated him evil, who nevertheless was a prophet,sanctified in his mother's womb, that he might root out, and afflict,and destroy; and that he might build up also, and plant.   

{49:8} It was Ezekiel who saw the glorious vision, which was shewedhim upon the chariot of the cherubims.   

{49:9} For he made mention of the enemies under the figure of therain, and directed them that went right.   

{49:10} And of the twelve prophets let the memorial be blessed, andlet their bones flourish again out of their place: for they comfortedJacob, and delivered them by assured hope.   

{49:11} How shall we magnify Zorobabel? even he was as a signet onthe right hand:   

{49:12} So was Jesus the son of Josedec: who in their time buildedthe house, and set up an holy temple to the Lord, which was preparedfor everlasting glory.   

{49:13} And among the elect was Neemias, whose renown is great, whoraised up for us the walls that were fallen, and set up the gates andthe bars, and raised up our ruins again.   

{49:14} But upon the earth was no man created like Enoch; for he wastaken from the earth.   

{49:15} Neither was there a young man born like Joseph, a governorof his brethren, a stay of the people, whose bones were regarded of theLord.   

{49:16} Sem and Seth were in great honour among men, and so was Adamabove every living thing in creation.   

{50:1} Simon the high priest, the son of Onias, who in his liferepaired the house again, and in his days fortified the temple:   

{50:2} And by him was built from the foundation the double height,the high fortress of the wall about the temple:   

{50:3} In his days the cistern to receive water, being in compass asthe sea, was covered with plates of brass:   

{50:4} He took care of the temple that it should not fall, andfortified the city against besieging:   

{50:5} How was he honoured in the midst of the people in his comingout of the sanctuary!   

{50:6} He was as the morning star in the midst of a cloud, and asthe moon at the full:   

{50:7} As the sun shining upon the temple of the most High, and asthe rainbow giving light in the bright clouds:   

{50:8} And as the flower of roses in the spring of the year, aslilies by the rivers of waters, and as the branches of the frankincensetree in the time of summer:   

{50:9} As fire and incense in the censer, and as a vessel of beatengold set with all manner of precious stones:   

{50:10} And as a fair olive tree budding forth fruit, and as acypress tree which groweth up to the clouds.   

{50:11} When he put on the robe of honour, and was clothed with theperfection of glory, when he went up to the holy altar, he made thegarment of holiness honourable.   

{50:12} When he took the portions out of the priests' hands, hehimself stood by the hearth of the altar, compassed about, as a youngcedar in Libanus; and as palm trees compassed they him round about.   

{50:13} So were all the sons of Aaron in their glory, and theoblations of the Lord in their hands, before all the congregation ofIsrael.   

{50:14} And finishing the service at the altar, that he might adornthe offering of the most high Almighty,   

{50:15} He stretched out his hand to the cup, and poured of theblood of the grape, he poured out at the foot of the altar asweetsmelling savour unto the most high King of all.   

{50:16} Then shouted the sons of Aaron, and sounded the silvertrumpets, and made a great noise to be heard, for a remembrance beforethe most High.   

{50:17} Then all the people together hasted, and fell down to theearth upon their faces to worship their Lord God Almighty, the mostHigh.   

{50:18} The singers also sang praises with their voices, with greatvariety of sounds was there made sweet melody.   

{50:19} And the people besought the Lord, the most High, by prayerbefore him that is merciful, till the solemnity of the Lord was ended,and they had finished his service.   

{50:20} Then he went down, and lifted up his hands over the wholecongregation of the children of Israel, to give the blessing of theLord with his lips, and to rejoice in his name.   

{50:21} And they bowed themselves down to worship the second time,that they might receive a blessing from the most High.   

{50:22} Now therefore bless ye the God of all, which only doethwondrous things every where, which exalteth our days from the womb, anddealeth with us according to his mercy.   

{50:23} He grant us joyfulness of heart, and that peace may be inour days in Israel for ever:   

{50:24} That he would confirm his mercy with us, and deliver us athis time!   

{50:25} There be two manner of nations which my heart abhorreth, andthe third is no nation:   

{50:26} They that sit upon the mountain of Samaria, and they thatdwell among the Philistines, and that foolish people that dwell inSichem.   

{50:27} Jesus the son of Sirach of Jerusalem hath written in thisbook the instruction of understanding and knowledge, who out of hisheart poured forth wisdom.   

{50:28} Blessed is he that shall be exercised in these things; andhe that layeth them up in his heart shall become wise.   

{50:29} For if he do them, he shall be strong to all things: for thelight of the Lord leadeth him, who giveth wisdom to the godly. Blessedbe the name of the Lord for ever. Amen, Amen.   A Prayer of Jesus the son of Sirach.   

{51:1} I will thank thee, O Lord and King, and praise thee, O God mySaviour: I do give praise unto thy name:   

{51:2} For thou art my defender and helper, and has preserved mybody from destruction, and from the snare of the slanderous tongue, andfrom the lips that forge lies, and has been mine helper against mineadversaries:   

{51:3} And hast delivered me, according to the multitude of theymercies and greatness of thy name, from the teeth of them that wereready to devour me, and out of the hands of such as sought after mylife, and from the manifold afflictions which I had;   

{51:4} From the choking of fire on every side, and from the midst ofthe fire which I kindled not;   

{51:5} From the depth of the belly of hell, from an unclean tongue,and from lying words.   

{51:6} By an accusation to the king from an unrighteous tongue mysoul drew near even unto death, my life was near to the hell beneath.   

{51:7} They compassed me on every side, and there was no man to helpme: I looked for the succour of men, but there was none.   

{51:8} Then thought I upon thy mercy, O Lord, and upon thy acts ofold, how thou deliverest such as wait for thee, and savest them out ofthe hands of the enemies.   

{51:9} Then lifted I up my supplications from the earth, and prayedfor deliverance from death.   

{51:10} I called upon the Lord, the Father of my Lord, that he wouldnot leave me in the days of my trouble, and in the time of the proud,when there was no help.   

{51:11} I will praise thy name continually, and will sing praiseswith thanksgiving; and so my prayer was heard:   

{51:12} For thou savedst me from destruction, and deliveredst mefrom the evil time: therefore will I give thanks, and praise thee, andbless they name, O Lord.   

{51:13} When I was yet young, or ever I went abroad, I desiredwisdom openly in my prayer.   

{51:14} I prayed for her before the temple, and will seek her outeven to the end.   

{51:15} Even from the flower till the grape was ripe hath my heartdelighted in her: my foot went the right way, from my youth up sought Iafter her.   

{51:16} I bowed down mine ear a little, and received her, and gatmuch learning.   

{51:17} I profited therein, therefore will I ascribe glory unto himthat giveth me wisdom.   

{51:18} For I purposed to do after her, and earnestly I followedthat which is good; so shall I not be confounded.   

{51:19} My soul hath wrestled with her, and in my doings I wasexact: I stretched forth my hands to the heaven above, and bewailed myignorances of her.   

{51:20} I directed my soul unto her, and I found her in pureness: Ihave had my heart joined with her from the beginning, therefore shall Inot be foresaken.   

{51:21} My heart was troubled in seeking her: therefore have Igotten a good possession.   

{51:22} The Lord hath given me a tongue for my reward, and I willpraise him therewith.   

{51:23} Draw near unto me, ye unlearned, and dwell in the house oflearning.   

{51:24} Wherefore are ye slow, and what say ye to these things,seeing your souls are very thirsty?   

{51:25} I opened my mouth, and said, Buy her for yourselves withoutmoney.   

{51:26} Put your neck under the yoke, and let your soul receiveinstruction: she is hard at hand to find.   

{51:27} Behold with your eyes, how that I have but little labour,and have gotten unto me much rest.   

{51:28} Get learning with a great sum of money, and get much gold byher.   

{51:29} Let your soul rejoice in his mercy, and be not ashamed ofhis praise.   

{51:30} Work your work betimes, and in his time he will give youyour reward.
