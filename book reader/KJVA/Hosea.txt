{Hosea   

{1:1} The word of the LORD that came unto Hosea, the son of Beeri,in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, [and] Hezekiah, kings of Judah,and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash, king of Israel. 

{1:2} Thebeginning of the word of the LORD by Hosea. And the LORD said to Hosea,Go, take unto thee a wife of whoredoms and children of whoredoms: forthe land hath committed great whoredom, [departing] from the LORD.

{1:3} So he went and took Gomer the daughter of Diblaim; whichconceived, and bare him a son. 

{1:4} And the LORD said unto him, Callhis name Jezreel; for yet a little [while,] and I will avenge the bloodof Jezreel upon the house of Jehu, and will cause to cease the kingdomof the house of Israel. 

{1:5} And it shall come to pass at that day,that I will break the bow of Israel in the valley of Jezreel.   

{1:6} And she conceived again, and bare a daughter. And [God] saidunto him, Call her name Lo-ruhamah: for I will no more have mercy uponthe house of Israel; but I will utterly take them away. 

{1:7} But Iwill have mercy upon the house of Judah, and will save them by the LORDtheir God, and will not save them by bow, nor by sword, nor by battle,by horses, nor by horsemen.   

{1:8} Now when she had weaned Lo-ruhamah, she conceived, and bare ason. 

{1:9} Then said [God,] Call his name Lo-ammi: for ye [are] not mypeople, and I will not be your [God.]   

{1:10} Yet the number of the children of Israel shall be as the sandof the sea, which cannot be measured nor numbered; and it shall come topass, [that] in the place where it was said unto them, Ye [are] not mypeople, [there] it shall be said unto them, [Ye are] the sons of theliving God. 

{1:11} Then shall the children of Judah and the children ofIsrael be gathered together, and appoint themselves one head, and theyshall come up out of the land: for great [shall be] the day of Jezreel.   

{2:1} Say ye unto your brethren, Ammi; and to your sisters,Ru-hamah. 

{2:2} Plead with your mother, plead: for she [is] not mywife, neither [am] I her husband: let her therefore put away herwhoredoms out of her sight, and her adulteries from between herbreasts; 

{2:3} Lest I strip her naked, and set her as in the day thatshe was born, and make her as a wilderness, and set her like a dryland, and slay her with thirst. 

{2:4} And I will not have mercy uponher children; for they [be] the children of whoredoms. 

{2:5} For theirmother hath played the harlot: she that conceived them hath doneshamefully: for she said, I will go after my lovers, that give [me] mybread and my water, my wool and my flax, mine oil and my drink.   

{2:6} Therefore, behold, I will hedge up thy way with thorns, andmake a wall, that she shall not find her paths. 

{2:7} And she shallfollow after her lovers, but she shall not overtake them; and she shallseek them, but shall not find [them:] then shall she say, I will go andreturn to my first husband; for then [was it] better with me than now.

{2:8} For she did not know that I gave her corn, and wine, and oil, andmultiplied her silver and gold, [which] they prepared for Baal. 

{2:9}Therefore will I return, and take away my corn in the time thereof, andmy wine in the season thereof, and will recover my wool and my flax[given] to cover her nakedness. 

{2:10} And now will I discover herlewdness in the sight of her lovers, and none shall deliver her out ofmine hand. 

{2:11} I will also cause all her mirth to cease, her feastdays, her new moons, and her sabbaths, and all her solemn feasts.

{2:12} And I will destroy her vines and her fig trees, whereof she hathsaid, These [are] my rewards that my lovers have given me: and I willmake them a forest, and the beasts of the field shall eat them. 

{2:13}And I will visit upon her the days of Baalim, wherein she burnedincense to them, and she decked herself with her earrings and herjewels, and she went after her lovers, and forgat me, saith the LORD.   

{2:14} Therefore, behold, I will allure her, and bring her into thewilderness, and speak comfortably unto her. 

{2:15} And I will give herher vineyards from thence, and the valley of Achor for a door of hope:and she shall sing there, as in the days of her youth, and as in theday when she came up out of the land of Egypt. 

{2:16} And it shall beat that day, saith the LORD, [that] thou shalt call me Ishi; and shaltcall me no more Baali. 

{2:17} For I will take away the names of Baalimout of her mouth, and they shall no more be remembered by their name.

{2:18} And in that day will I make a covenant for them with the beastsof the field, and with the fowls of heaven, and [with] the creepingthings of the ground: and I will break the bow and the sword and thebattle out of the earth, and will make them to lie down safely. 

{2:19}And I will betroth thee unto me for ever; yea, I will betroth thee untome in righteousness, and in judgment, and in lovingkindness, and inmercies. 

{2:20} I will even betroth thee unto me in faithfulness: andthou shalt know the LORD. 

{2:21} And it shall come to pass in that day,I will hear, saith the LORD, I will hear the heavens, and they shallhear the earth; 

{2:22} And the earth shall hear the corn, and the wine,and the oil; and they shall hear Jezreel. 

{2:23} And I will sow herunto me in the earth; and I will have mercy upon her that had notobtained mercy; and I will say to [them which were] not my people, Thou[art] my people; and they shall say, [Thou art] my God.   

{3:1} Then said the LORD unto me, Go yet, love a woman beloved of[her] friend, yet an adulteress, according to the love of the LORDtoward the children of Israel, who look to other gods, and love flagonsof wine. 

{3:2} So I bought her to me for fifteen [pieces] of silver,and [for] an homer of barley, and an half homer of barley: 

{3:3} And Isaid unto her, Thou shalt abide for me many days; thou shalt not playthe harlot, and thou shalt not be for [another] man: so [will] I also[be] for thee. 

{3:4} For the children of Israel shall abide many dayswithout a king, and without a prince, and without a sacrifice, andwithout an image, and without an ephod, and [without] teraphim: 

{3:5}Afterward shall the children of Israel return, and seek the LORD theirGod, and David their king; and shall fear the LORD and his goodness inthe latter days.   

{4:1} Hear the word of the LORD, ye children of Israel: for the LORDhath a controversy with the inhabitants of the land, because [there is]no truth, nor mercy, nor knowledge of God in the land. 

{4:2} Byswearing, and lying, and killing, and stealing, and committingadultery, they break out, and blood toucheth blood. 

{4:3} Thereforeshall the land mourn, and every one that dwelleth therein shalllanguish, with the beasts of the field, and with the fowls of heaven;yea, the fishes of the sea also shall be taken away. 

{4:4} Yet let noman strive, nor reprove another: for thy people [are] as they thatstrive with the priest. 

{4:5} Therefore shalt thou fall in the day, andthe prophet also shall fall with thee in the night, and I will destroythy mother.   

{4:6} My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge: because thouhast rejected knowledge, I will also reject thee, that thou shalt be nopriest to me: seeing thou hast forgotten the law of thy God, I willalso forget thy children. 

{4:7} As they were increased, so they sinnedagainst me: [therefore] will I change their glory into shame. 

{4:8}They eat up the sin of my people, and they set their heart on theiriniquity. 

{4:9} And there shall be, like people, like priest: and Iwill punish them for their ways, and reward them their doings. 

{4:10}For they shall eat, and not have enough: they shall commit whoredom,and shall not increase: because they have left off to take heed to theLORD. 

{4:11} Whoredom and wine and new wine take away the heart.   

{4:12} My people ask counsel at their stocks, and their staffdeclareth unto them: for the spirit of whoredoms hath caused [them] toerr, and they have gone a whoring from under their God. 

{4:13} Theysacrifice upon the tops of the mountains, and burn incense upon thehills, under oaks and poplars and elms, because the shadow thereof [is]good: therefore your daughters shall commit whoredom, and your spousesshall commit adultery. 

{4:14} I will not punish your daughters whenthey commit whoredom, nor your spouses when they commit adultery: forthemselves are separated with whores, and they sacrifice with harlots:therefore the people [that] doth not understand shall fall.   

{4:15} Though thou, Israel, play the harlot, [yet] let not Judahoffend; and come not ye unto Gilgal, neither go ye up to Beth-aven, norswear, The LORD liveth. 

{4:16} For Israel slideth back as a backslidingheifer: now the LORD will feed them as a lamb in a large place. 

{4:17}Ephraim [is] joined to idols: let him alone. 

{4:18} Their drink issour: they have committed whoredom continually: her rulers [with] shamedo love, Give ye. 

{4:19} The wind hath bound her up in her wings, andthey shall be ashamed because of their sacrifices.   

{5:1} Hear ye this, O priests; and hearken, ye house of Israel; andgive ye ear, O house of the king; for judgment [is] toward you, becauseye have been a snare on Mizpah, and a net spread upon Tabor. 

{5:2} Andthe revolters are profound to make slaughter, though I [have been] arebuker of them all. 

{5:3} I know Ephraim, and Israel is not hid fromme: for now, O Ephraim, thou committest whoredom, [and] Israel isdefiled. 

{5:4} They will not frame their doings to turn unto their God:for the spirit of whoredoms [is] in the midst of them, and they havenot known the LORD. 

{5:5} And the pride of Israel doth testify to hisface: therefore shall Israel and Ephraim fall in their iniquity; Judahalso shall fall with them. 

{5:6} They shall go with their flocks andwith their herds to seek the LORD; but they shall not find [him;] hehath withdrawn himself from them. 

{5:7} They have dealt treacherouslyagainst the LORD: for they have begotten strange children: now shall amonth devour them with their portions. 

{5:8} Blow ye the cornet inGibeah, [and] the trumpet in Ramah: cry aloud [at] Beth-aven, afterthee, O Benjamin. 

{5:9} Ephraim shall be desolate in the day of rebuke:among the tribes of Israel have I made known that which shall surelybe. 

{5:10} The princes of Judah were like them that remove the bound:[therefore] I will pour out my wrath upon them like water. 

{5:11}Ephraim [is] oppressed [and] broken in judgment, because he willinglywalked after the commandment. 

{5:12} Therefore [will] I [be] untoEphraim as a moth, and to the house of Judah as rottenness. 

{5:13} WhenEphraim saw his sickness, and Judah [saw] his wound, then went Ephraimto the Assyrian, and sent to king Jareb: yet could he not heal you, norcure you of your wound. 

{5:14} For I will [be] unto Ephraim as a lion,and as a young lion to the house of Judah: I, [even] I, will tear andgo away; I will take away, and none shall rescue [him.]   

{5:15} I will go [and] return to my place, till they acknowledgetheir offence, and seek my face: in their affliction they will seek meearly.   

{6:1} Come, and let us return unto the LORD: for he hath torn, andhe will heal us; he hath smitten, and he will bind us up. 

{6:2} Aftertwo days will he revive us: in the third day he will raise us up, andwe shall live in his sight. 

{6:3} Then shall we know, [if] we follow onto know the LORD: his going forth is prepared as the morning; and heshall come unto us as the rain, as the latter [and] former rain untothe earth.   

{6:4} O Ephraim, what shall I do unto thee? O Judah, what shall I dounto thee? for your goodness [is] as a morning cloud, and as the earlydew it goeth away. 

{6:5} Therefore have I hewed [them] by the prophets;I have slain them by the words of my mouth: and thy judgments [are as]the light [that] goeth forth. 

{6:6} For I desired mercy, and notsacrifice; and the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings. 

{6:7}But they like men have transgressed the covenant: there have they dealttreacherously against me. 

{6:8} Gilead [is] a city of them that workiniquity, [and is] polluted with blood. 

{6:9} And as troops of robberswait for a man, [so] the company of priests murder in the way byconsent: for they commit lewdness. 

{6:10} I have seen an horrible thingin the house of Israel: there [is] the whoredom of Ephraim, Israel isdefiled. 

{6:11} Also, O Judah, he hath set an harvest for thee, when Ireturned the captivity of my people.   

{7:1} When I would have healed Israel, then the iniquity of Ephraimwas discovered, and the wickedness of Samaria: for they commitfalsehood; and the thief cometh in, [and] the troop of robbers spoilethwithout. 

{7:2} And they consider not in their hearts [that] I rememberall their wickedness: now their own doings have beset them about; theyare before my face. 

{7:3} They make the king glad with theirwickedness, and the princes with their lies. 

{7:4} They [are] alladulterers, as an oven heated by the baker, [who] ceaseth from raisingafter he hath kneaded the dough, until it be leavened. 

{7:5} In the dayof our king the princes have made [him] sick with bottles of wine; hestretched out his hand with scorners. 

{7:6} For they have made readytheir heart like an oven, whiles they lie in wait: their baker sleepethall the night; in the morning it burneth as a flaming fire. 

{7:7} Theyare all hot as an oven, and have devoured their judges; all their kingsare fallen: [there is] none among them that calleth unto me. 

{7:8}Ephraim, he hath mixed himself among the people; Ephraim is a cake notturned. 

{7:9} Strangers have devoured his strength, and he knoweth [it]not: yea, gray hairs are here and there upon him, yet he knoweth not.

{7:10} And the pride of Israel testifieth to his face: and they do notreturn to the LORD their God, nor seek him for all this.   

{7:11} Ephraim also is like a silly dove without heart: they call toEgypt, they go to Assyria. 

{7:12} When they shall go, I will spread mynet upon them; I will bring them down as the fowls of the heaven; Iwill chastise them, as their congregation hath heard. 

{7:13} Woe untothem! for they have fled from me: destruction unto them! because theyhave transgressed against me: though I have redeemed them, yet theyhave spoken lies against me. 

{7:14} And they have not cried unto mewith their heart, when they howled upon their beds: they assemblethemselves for corn and wine, [and] they rebel against me. 

{7:15}Though I have bound [and] strengthened their arms, yet do they imaginemischief against me. 

{7:16} They return, [but] not to the most High:they are like a deceitful bow: their princes shall fall by the swordfor the rage of their tongue: this [shall be] their derision in theland of Egypt.   

{8:1} [Set] the trumpet to thy mouth. [He shall come] as an eagleagainst the house of the LORD, because they have transgressed mycovenant, and trespassed against my law. 

{8:2} Israel shall cry untome, My God, we know thee. 

{8:3} Israel hath cast off [the thing thatis] good: the enemy shall pursue him. 

{8:4} They have set up kings, butnot by me: they have made princes, and I knew [it] not: of their silverand their gold have they made them idols, that they may be cut off.   

{8:5} Thy calf, O Samaria, hath cast [thee] off; mine anger iskindled against them: how long [will it be] ere they attain toinnocency? 

{8:6} For from Israel [was] it also: the workman made it;therefore it [is] not God: but the calf of Samaria shall be broken inpieces. 

{8:7} For they have sown the wind, and they shall reap thewhirlwind: it hath no stalk: the bud shall yield no meal: if so be ityield, the strangers shall swallow it up. 

{8:8} Israel is swallowed up:now shall they be among the Gentiles as a vessel wherein [is] nopleasure. 

{8:9} For they are gone up to Assyria, a wild ass alone byhimself: Ephraim hath hired lovers. 

{8:10} Yea, though they have hiredamong the nations, now will I gather them, and they shall sorrow alittle for the burden of the king of princes. 

{8:11} Because Ephraimhath made many altars to sin, altars shall be unto him to sin. 

{8:12} Ihave written to him the great things of my law, [but] they were countedas a strange thing. 

{8:13} They sacrifice flesh [for] the sacrifices ofmine offerings, and [eat it;] but the LORD accepteth them not; now willhe remember their iniquity, and visit their sins: they shall return toEgypt. 

{8:14} For Israel hath forgotten his Maker, and buildethtemples; and Judah hath multiplied fenced cities: but I will send afire upon his cities, and it shall devour the palaces thereof.   

{9:1} Rejoice not, O Israel, for joy, as [other] people: for thouhast gone a whoring from thy God, thou hast loved a reward upon everycornfloor. 

{9:2} The floor and the winepress shall not feed them, andthe new wine shall fail in her. 

{9:3} They shall not dwell in theLORD'S land; but Ephraim shall return to Egypt, and they shall eatunclean [things] in Assyria. 

{9:4} They shall not offer wine[offerings] to the LORD, neither shall they be pleasing unto him: theirsacrifices [shall be] unto them as the bread of mourners; all that eatthereof shall be polluted: for their bread for their soul shall notcome into the house of the LORD. 

{9:5} What will ye do in the solemnday, and in the day of the feast of the LORD? 

{9:6} For, lo, they aregone because of destruction: Egypt shall gather them up, Memphis shallbury them: the pleasant [places] for their silver, nettles shallpossess them: thorns [shall be] in their tabernacles. 

{9:7} The days ofvisitation are come, the days of recompence are come; Israel shall know[it:] the prophet [is] a fool, the spiritual man [is] mad, for themultitude of thine iniquity, and the great hatred. 

{9:8} The watchmanof Ephraim [was] with my God: [but] the prophet [is] a snare of afowler in all his ways, [and] hatred in the house of his God. 

{9:9}They have deeply corrupted [themselves,] as in the days of Gibeah:[therefore] he will remember their iniquity, he will visit their sins.

{9:10} I found Israel like grapes in the wilderness; I saw your fathersas the firstripe in the fig tree at her first time: [but] they went toBaal-peor, and separated themselves unto [that] shame; and [their]abominations were according as they loved. 

{9:11} [As for] Ephraim,their glory shall fly away like a bird, from the birth, and from thewomb, and from the conception. 

{9:12} Though they bring up theirchildren, yet will I bereave them, [that there shall] not [be] a man[left:] yea, woe also to them when I depart from them! 

{9:13} Ephraim,as I saw Tyrus, [is] planted in a pleasant place: but Ephraim shallbring forth his children to the murderer. 

{9:14} Give them, O LORD:what wilt thou give? give them a miscarrying womb and dry breasts.

{9:15} All their wickedness [is] in Gilgal: for there I hated them: forthe wickedness of their doings I will drive them out of mine house, Iwill love them no more: all their princes [are] revolters. 

{9:16}Ephraim is smitten, their root is dried up, they shall bear no fruit:yea, though they bring forth, yet will I slay [even] the beloved[fruit] of their womb. 

{9:17} My God will cast them away, because theydid not hearken unto him: and they shall be wanderers among the nations.   

{10:1} Israel [is] an empty vine, he bringeth forth fruit untohimself: according to the multitude of his fruit he hath increased thealtars; according to the goodness of his land they have made goodlyimages. 

{10:2} Their heart is divided; now shall they be found faulty:he shall break down their altars, he shall spoil their images. 

{10:3}For now they shall say, We have no king, because we feared not theLORD; what then should a king do to us? 

{10:4} They have spoken words,swearing falsely in making a covenant: thus judgment springeth up ashemlock in the furrows of the field. 

{10:5} The inhabitants of Samariashall fear because of the calves of Beth-aven: for the people thereofshall mourn over it, and the priests thereof [that] rejoiced on it, forthe glory thereof, because it is departed from it. 

{10:6} It shall bealso carried unto Assyria [for] a present to king Jareb: Ephraim shallreceive shame, and Israel shall be ashamed of his own counsel. 

{10:7}[As for] Samaria, her king is cut off as the foam upon the water.

{10:8} The high places also of Aven, the sin of Israel, shall bedestroyed: the thorn and the thistle shall come up on their altars; andthey shall say to the mountains, Cover us; and to the hills, Fall onus. 

{10:9} O Israel, thou hast sinned from the days of Gibeah: therethey stood: the battle in Gibeah against the children of iniquity didnot overtake them. 

{10:10} [It is] in my desire that I should chastisethem; and the people shall be gathered against them, when they shallbind themselves in their two furrows. 

{10:11} And Ephraim [is as] anheifer [that is] taught, [and] loveth to tread out [the corn;] but Ipassed over upon her fair neck: I will make Ephraim to ride; Judahshall plow, [and] Jacob shall break his clods. 

{10:12} Sow toyourselves in righteousness, reap in mercy; break up your fallowground: for [it is] time to seek the LORD, till he come and rainrighteousness upon you. 

{10:13} Ye have plowed wickedness, ye havereaped iniquity; ye have eaten the fruit of lies: because thou didsttrust in thy way, in the multitude of thy mighty men. 

{10:14} Thereforeshall a tumult arise among thy people, and all thy fortresses shall bespoiled, as Shalman spoiled Beth- arbel in the day of battle: themother was dashed in pieces upon [her] children. 

{10:15} So shallBethel do unto you because of your great wickedness: in a morning shallthe king of Israel utterly be cut off.   

{11:1} When Israel [was] a child, then I loved him, and called myson out of Egypt. 

{11:2} [As] they called them, so they went from them:they sacrificed unto Baalim, and burned incense to graven images.

{11:3} I taught Ephraim also to go, taking them by their arms; but theyknew not that I healed them. 

{11:4} I drew them with cords of a man,with bands of love: and I was to them as they that take off the yoke ontheir jaws, and I laid meat unto them.   

{11:5} He shall not return into the land of Egypt, but the Assyrianshall be his king, because they refused to return. 

{11:6} And the swordshall abide on his cities, and shall consume his branches, and devour[them,] because of their own counsels. 

{11:7} And my people are bent tobacksliding from me: though they called them to the most High, none atall would exalt [him. ]

{11:8} How shall I give thee up, Ephraim? [how]shall I deliver thee, Israel? how shall I make thee as Admah? [how]shall I set thee as Zeboim? mine heart is turned within me, myrepentings are kindled together. 

{11:9} I will not execute thefierceness of mine anger, I will not return to destroy Ephraim: for I[am] God, and not man; the Holy One in the midst of thee: and I willnot enter into the city. 

{11:10} They shall walk after the LORD: heshall roar like a lion: when he shall roar, then the children shalltremble from the west. 

{11:11} They shall tremble as a bird out ofEgypt, and as a dove out of the land of Assyria: and I will place themin their houses, saith the LORD. 

{11:12} Ephraim compasseth me aboutwith lies, and the house of Israel with deceit: but Judah yet rulethwith God, and is faithful with the saints.   

{12:1} Ephraim feedeth on wind, and followeth after the east wind:he daily increaseth lies and desolation; and they do make a covenantwith the Assyrians, and oil is carried into Egypt. 

{12:2} The LORD hathalso a controversy with Judah, and will punish Jacob according to hisways; according to his doings will he recompense him. 

{12:3} He tookhis brother by the heel in the womb, and by his strength he had powerwith God: 

{12:4} Yea, he had power over the angel, and prevailed: hewept, and made supplication unto him: he found him [in] Bethel, andthere he spake with us; 

{12:5} Even the LORD God of hosts; the LORD[is] his memorial. 

{12:6} Therefore turn thou to thy God: keep mercyand judgment, and wait on thy God continually.   

{12:7} [He is] a merchant, the balances of deceit [are] in his hand:he loveth to oppress. 

{12:8} And Ephraim said, Yet I am become rich, Ihave found me out substance: [in] all my labours they shall find noneiniquity in me that [were] sin. 

{12:9} And I [that am] the LORD thy Godfrom the land of Egypt will yet make thee to dwell in tabernacles, asin the days of the solemn feast. 

{12:10} I have also spoken by theprophets, and I have multiplied visions, and used similitudes, by theministry of the prophets. 

{12:11} [Is there] iniquity [in] Gilead?surely they are vanity: they sacrifice bullocks in Gilgal; yea, theiraltars [are] as heaps in the furrows of the fields. 

{12:12} And Jacobfled into the country of Syria, and Israel served for a wife, and for awife he kept [sheep. ]

{12:13} And by a prophet the LORD brought Israelout of Egypt, and by a prophet was he preserved. 

{12:14} Ephraimprovoked [him] to anger most bitterly: therefore shall he leave hisblood upon him, and his reproach shall his Lord return unto him.   

{13:1} When Ephraim spake trembling, he exalted himself in Israel;but when he offended in Baal, he died. 

{13:2} And now they sin more andmore, and have made them molten images of their silver, [and] idolsaccording to their own understanding, all of it the work of thecraftsmen: they say of them, Let the men that sacrifice kiss thecalves. 

{13:3} Therefore they shall be as the morning cloud, and as theearly dew that passeth away, as the chaff [that] is driven with thewhirlwind out of the floor, and as the smoke out of the chimney. 

{13:4}Yet I [am] the LORD thy God from the land of Egypt, and thou shalt knowno god but me: for [there is] no saviour beside me.   

{13:5} I did know thee in the wilderness, in the land of greatdrought. 

{13:6} According to their pasture, so were they filled; theywere filled, and their heart was exalted; therefore have they forgottenme. 

{13:7} Therefore I will be unto them as a lion: as a leopard by theway will I observe [them: ]

{13:8} I will meet them as a bear [that is]bereaved [of her whelps,] and will rend the caul of their heart, andthere will I devour them like a lion: the wild beast shall tear them.

{13:9} O Israel, thou hast destroyed thyself; but in me [is] thinehelp. 

{13:10} I will be thy king: where [is any other] that may savethee in all thy cities? and thy judges of whom thou saidst, Give me aking and princes? 

{13:11} I gave thee a king in mine anger, and took[him] away in my wrath. 

{13:12} The iniquity of Ephraim [is] bound up;his sin [is] hid. 

{13:13} The sorrows of a travailing woman shall comeupon him: he [is] an unwise son; for he should not stay long in [theplace of] the breaking forth of children. 

{13:14} I will ransom themfrom the power of the grave; I will redeem them from death: O death, Iwill be thy plagues; O grave, I will be thy destruction: repentanceshall be hid from mine eyes.   

{13:15} Though he be fruitful among [his] brethren, an east windshall come, the wind of the LORD shall come up from the wilderness, andhis spring shall become dry, and his fountain shall be dried up: heshall spoil the treasure of all pleasant vessels. 

{13:16} Samaria shallbecome desolate; for she hath rebelled against her God: they shall fallby the sword: their infants shall be dashed in pieces, and their womenwith child shall be ripped up.   

{14:1} O Israel, return unto the LORD thy God; for thou hast fallenby thine iniquity. 

{14:2} Take with you words, and turn to the LORD:say unto him, Take away all iniquity, and receive [us] graciously: sowill we render the calves of our lips. 

{14:3} Asshur shall not save us;we will not ride upon horses: neither will we say any more to the workof our hands, [Ye are] our gods: for in thee the fatherless findethmercy.

{14:9} Who [is] wise, and he shall understand these [things?]prudent, and he shall know them? for the ways of the LORD [are] right,and the just shall walk in them: but the transgressors shall falltherein.
