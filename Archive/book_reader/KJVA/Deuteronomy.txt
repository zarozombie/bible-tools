{The Fifth Book of Moses, called Deuteronomy   

{1:1} These [be] the words which Moses spake unto all Israel on thisside Jordan in the wilderness, in the plain over against the Red [sea,]between Paran, and Tophel, and Laban, and Hazeroth, and Dizahab. 

{1:2}([There are] eleven days' [journey] from Horeb by the way of mount Seirunto Kadesh-barnea.) 

{1:3} And it came to pass in the fortieth year, inthe eleventh month, on the first [day] of the month, [that] Moses spakeunto the children of Israel, according unto all that the LORD had givenhim in commandment unto them; 

{1:4} After he had slain Sihon the kingof the Amorites, which dwelt in Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan,which dwelt at Astaroth in Edrei: 

{1:5} On this side Jordan, in theland of Moab, began Moses to declare this law, saying, 

{1:6} The LORDour God spake unto us in Horeb, saying, Ye have dwelt long enough inthis mount: 

{1:7} Turn you, and take your journey, and go to the mountof the Amorites, and unto all [the places] nigh thereunto, in theplain, in the hills, and in the vale, and in the south, and by the seaside, to the land of the Canaanites, and unto Lebanon, unto the greatriver, the river Euphrates. 

{1:8} Behold, I have set the land beforeyou: go in and possess the land which the LORD sware unto your fathers,Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, to give unto them and to their seed afterthem.   

{1:9} And I spake unto you at that time, saying, I am not able tobear you myself alone: 

{1:10} The LORD your God hath multiplied you,and, behold, ye [are] this day as the stars of heaven for multitude.

{1:11} (The LORD God of your fathers make you a thousand times so manymore as ye [are,] and bless you, as he hath promised you!) 

{1:12} Howcan I myself alone bear your cumbrance, and your burden, and yourstrife? 

{1:13} Take you wise men, and understanding, and known amongyour tribes, and I will make them rulers over you. 

{1:14} And yeanswered me, and said, The thing which thou hast spoken is good [forus] to do. 

{1:15} So I took the chief of your tribes, wise men, andknown, and made them heads over you, captains over thousands, andcaptains over hundreds, and captains over fifties, and captains overtens, and officers among your tribes. 

{1:16} And I charged your judgesat that time, saying, Hear [the causes] between your brethren, andjudge righteously between [every] man and his brother, and the stranger[that is] with him. 

{1:17} Ye shall not respect persons in judgment;[but ]ye shall hear the small as well as the great; ye shall not beafraid of the face of man; for the judgment [is ]God's: and the causethat is too hard for you, bring [it ]unto me, and I will hear it.

{1:18} And I commanded you at that time all the things which ye shoulddo.   

{1:19} And when we departed from Horeb, we went through all thatgreat and terrible wilderness, which ye saw by the way of the mountainof the Amorites, as the LORD our God commanded us; and we came toKadesh-barnea. 

{1:20} And I said unto you, Ye are come unto themountain of the Amorites, which the LORD our God doth give unto us.

{1:21} Behold, the LORD thy God hath set the land before thee: go up[and] possess [it,] as the LORD God of thy fathers hath said unto thee;fear not, neither be discouraged.   

{1:22} And ye came near unto me every one of you, and said, We willsend men before us, and they shall search us out the land, and bring usword again by what way we must go up, and into what cities we shallcome. 

{1:23} and the saying pleased me well: and I took twelve men ofyou, one of a tribe: 

{1:24} And they turned and went up into themountain, and came unto the valley of Eshcol, and searched it out.

{1:25} And they took of the fruit of the land in their hands, andbrought [it] down unto us, and brought us word again, and said, [It is]a good land which the LORD our God doth give us. 

{1:26} Notwithstandingye would not go up, but rebelled against the commandment of the LORDyour God: 

{1:27} And ye murmured in your tents, and said, Because theLORD hated us, he hath brought us forth out of the land of Egypt, todeliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us. 

{1:28} Whithershall we go up? our brethren have discouraged our heart, saying, Thepeople [is] greater and taller than we; the cities [are] great andwalled up to heaven; and moreover we have seen the sons of the Anakimsthere. 

{1:29} Then I said unto you, Dread not, neither be afraid ofthem. 

{1:30} The LORD your God which goeth before you, he shall fightfor you, according to all that he did for you in Egypt before youreyes; 

{1:31} And in the wilderness, where thou hast seen how that theLORD thy God bare thee, as a man doth bear his son, in all the way thatye went, until ye came into this place. 

{1:32} Yet in this thing ye didnot believe the LORD your God, 

{1:33} Who went in the way before you,to search you out a place to pitch your tents [in,] in fire by night,to shew you by what way ye should go, and in a cloud by day. 

{1:34} Andthe LORD heard the voice of your words, and was wroth, and sware,saying, 

{1:35} Surely there shall not one of these men of this evilgeneration see that good land, which I sware to give unto your fathers,

{1:36} Save Caleb the son of Jephunneh; he shall see it, and to himwill I give the land that he hath trodden upon, and to his children,because he hath wholly followed the LORD. 

{1:37} Also the LORD wasangry with me for your sakes, saying, Thou also shalt not go inthither. 

{1:38} [But] Joshua the son of Nun, which standeth beforethee, he shall go in thither: encourage him: for he shall cause Israelto inherit it. 

{1:39} Moreover your little ones, which ye said shouldbe a prey, and your children, which in that day had no knowledgebetween good and evil, they shall go in thither, and unto them will Igive it, and they shall possess it. 

{1:40} But [as for] you, turn you,and take your journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea.

{1:41} Then ye answered and said unto me, We have sinned against theLORD, we will go up and fight, according to all that the LORD our Godcommanded us. And when ye had girded on every man his weapons of war,ye were ready to go up into the hill. 

{1:42} And the LORD said unto me,Say unto them, Go not up, neither fight; for I [am] not among you; lestye be smitten before your enemies. 

{1:43} So I spake unto you; and yewould not hear, but rebelled against the commandment of the LORD, andwent presumptuously up into the hill. 

{1:44} And the Amorites, whichdwelt in that mountain, came out against you, and chased you, as beesdo, and destroyed you in Seir, [even] unto Hormah. 

{1:45} And yereturned and wept before the LORD; but the LORD would not hearken toyour voice, nor give ear unto you. 

{1:46} So ye abode in Kadesh manydays, according unto the days that ye abode [there.]   

{2:1} Then we turned, and took our journey into the wilderness bythe way of the Red sea, as the LORD spake unto me: and we compassedmount Seir many days. 

{2:2} And the LORD spake unto me, saying, 

{2:3}Ye have compassed this mountain long enough: turn you northward. 

{2:4}And command thou the people, saying, Ye [are] to pass through the coastof your brethren the children of Esau, which dwell in Seir; and theyshall be afraid of you: take ye good heed unto yourselves therefore:

{2:5} Meddle not with them; for I will not give you of their land, no,not so much as a footbreadth; because I have given mount Seir unto Esau[for] a possession. 

{2:6} Ye shall buy meat of them for money, that yemay eat; and ye shall also buy water of them for money, that ye maydrink. 

{2:7} For the LORD thy God hath blessed thee in all the works ofthy hand: he knoweth thy walking through this great wilderness: theseforty years the LORD thy God [hath been] with thee; thou hast lackednothing. 

{2:8} And when we passed by from our brethren the children ofEsau, which dwelt in Seir, through the way of the plain from Elath, andfrom Ezion-gaber, we turned and passed by the way of the wilderness ofMoab. 

{2:9} And the LORD said unto me, Distress not the Moabites,neither contend with them in battle: for I will not give thee of theirland [for] a possession; because I have given Ar unto the children ofLot [for] a possession. 

{2:10} The Emims dwelt therein in times past, apeople great, and many, and tall, as the Anakims; 

{2:11} Which alsowere accounted giants, as the Anakims; but the Moabites call themEmims. 

{2:12} The Horims also dwelt in Seir beforetime; but thechildren of Esau succeeded them, when they had destroyed them frombefore them, and dwelt in their stead; as Israel did unto the land ofhis possession, which the LORD gave unto them. 

{2:13} Now rise up,[said I,] and get you over the brook Zered. And we went over the brookZered. 

{2:14} And the space in which we came from Kadesh-barnea, untilwe were come over the brook Zered, [was] thirty and eight years; untilall the generation of the men of war were wasted out from among thehost, as the LORD sware unto them. 

{2:15} For indeed the hand of theLORD was against them, to destroy them from among the host, until theywere consumed.   

{2:16} So it came to pass, when all the men of war were consumed anddead from among the people, 

{2:17} That the LORD spake unto me, saying,

{2:18} Thou art to pass over through Ar, the coast of Moab, this day:

{2:19} And [when] thou comest nigh over against the children of Ammon,distress them not, nor meddle with them: for I will not give thee ofthe land of the children of Ammon [any] possession; because I havegiven it unto the children of Lot [for] a possession. 

{2:20} (That alsowas accounted a land of giants: giants dwelt therein in old time; andthe Ammonites call them Zamzummims; 

{2:21} A people great, and many,and tall, as the Anakims; but the LORD destroyed them before them; andthey succeeded them, and dwelt in their stead: 

{2:22} As he did to thechildren of Esau, which dwelt in Seir, when he destroyed the Horimsfrom before them; and they succeeded them, and dwelt in their steadeven unto this day: 

{2:23} And the Avims which dwelt in Hazerim, [even]unto Azzah, the Caphtorims, which came forth out of Caphtor, destroyedthem, and dwelt in their stead.)   

{2:24} Rise ye up, take your journey, and pass over the river Arnon:behold, I have given into thine hand Sihon the Amorite, king ofHeshbon, and his land: begin to possess [it,] and contend with him inbattle. 

{2:25} This day will I begin to put the dread of thee and thefear of thee upon the nations [that are] under the whole heaven, whoshall hear report of thee, and shall tremble, and be in anguish becauseof thee.   

{2:26} And I sent messengers out of the wilderness of Kedemoth untoSihon king of Heshbon with words of peace, saying, 

{2:27} Let me passthrough thy land: I will go along by the high way, I will neither turnunto the right hand nor to the left. 

{2:28} Thou shalt sell me meat formoney, that I may eat; and give me water for money, that I may drink:only I will pass through on my feet; 

{2:29} (As the children of Esauwhich dwell in Seir, and the Moabites which dwell in Ar, did unto me;)until I shall pass over Jordan into the land which the LORD our Godgiveth us. 

{2:30} But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass byhim: for the LORD thy God hardened his spirit, and made his heartobstinate, that he might deliver him into thy hand, as [appeareth] thisday. 

{2:31} And the LORD said unto me, Behold, I have begun to giveSihon and his land before thee: begin to possess, that thou mayestinherit his land. 

{2:32} Then Sihon came out against us, he and all hispeople, to fight at Jahaz. 

{2:33} And the LORD our God delivered himbefore us; and we smote him, and his sons, and all his people. 

{2:34}And we took all his cities at that time, and utterly destroyed the men,and the women, and the little ones, of every city, we left none toremain: 

{2:35} Only the cattle we took for a prey unto ourselves, andthe spoil of the cities which we took. 

{2:36} From Aroer, which [is] bythe brink of the river of Arnon, and [from] the city that [is] by theriver, even unto Gilead, there was not one city too strong for us: theLORD our God delivered all unto us: 

{2:37} Only unto the land of thechildren of Ammon thou camest not, nor unto any place of the riverJabbok, [nor] unto the cities in the mountains, nor unto whatsoever theLORD our God forbad us.   

{3:1} Then we turned, and went up the way to Bashan: and Og the kingof Bashan came out against us, he and all his people, to battle atEdrei. 

{3:2} And the LORD said unto me, Fear him not: for I willdeliver him, and all his people, and his land, into thy hand; and thoushalt do unto him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites, whichdwelt at Heshbon. 

{3:3} So the LORD our God delivered into our hands Ogalso, the king of Bashan, and all his people: and we smote him untilnone was left to him remaining. 

{3:4} And we took all his cities atthat time, there was not a city which we took not from them, threescorecities, all the region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan. 

{3:5} Allthese cities [were] fenced with high walls, gates, and bars; besideunwalled towns a great many. 

{3:6} And we utterly destroyed them, as wedid unto Sihon king of Heshbon, utterly destroying the men, women, andchildren, of every city. 

{3:7} But all the cattle, and the spoil of thecities, we took for a prey to ourselves. 

{3:8} And we took at that timeout of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites the land that [was] onthis side Jordan, from the river of Arnon unto mount Hermon; 

{3:9}([Which] Hermon the Sidonians call Sirion; and the Amorites call itShenir;) 

{3:10} All the cities of the plain, and all Gilead, and allBashan, unto Salchah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan.

{3:11} For only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of giants;behold, his bedstead [was] a bedstead of iron; is it not in Rabbath ofthe children of Ammon? nine cubits was the length thereof, and fourcubits the breadth of it, after the cubit of a man. 

{3:12} And thisland, [which] we possessed at that time, from Aroer, which [is] by theriver Arnon, and half mount Gilead, and the cities thereof, gave I untothe Reubenites and to the Gadites. 

{3:13} And the rest of Gilead, andall Bashan, [being] the kingdom of Og, gave I unto the half tribe ofManasseh; all the region of Argob, with all Bashan, which was calledthe land of giants. 

{3:14} Jair the son of Manasseh took all thecountry of Argob unto the coasts of Geshuri and Maachathi; and calledthem after his own name, Bashan- havoth-jair, unto this day. 

{3:15} AndI gave Gilead unto Machir. 

{3:16} And unto the Reubenites and unto theGadites I gave from Gilead even unto the river Arnon half the valley,and the border even unto the river Jabbok, [which is] the border of thechildren of Ammon; 

{3:17} The plain also, and Jordan, and the coast[thereof,] from Chinnereth even unto the sea of the plain, [even] thesalt sea, under Ashdoth-pisgah eastward.   

{3:18} And I commanded you at that time, saying, The LORD your Godhath given you this land to possess it: ye shall pass over armed beforeyour brethren the children of Israel, all [that are] meet for the war.

{3:19} But your wives, and your little ones, and your cattle, ([for] Iknow that ye have much cattle,) shall abide in your cities which I havegiven you; 

{3:20} Until the LORD have given rest unto your brethren, aswell as unto you, and [until] they also possess the land which the LORDyour God hath given them beyond Jordan: and [then] shall ye returnevery man unto his possession, which I have given you.   

{3:21} And I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, Thine eyes haveseen all that the LORD your God hath done unto these two kings: soshall the LORD do unto all the kingdoms whither thou passest. 

{3:22} Yeshall not fear them: for the LORD your God he shall fight for you.

{3:23} And I besought the LORD at that time, saying, 

{3:24} O Lord GOD,thou hast begun to shew thy servant thy greatness, and thy mighty hand:for what God [is there] in heaven or in earth, that can do according tothy works, and according to thy might? 

{3:25} I pray thee, let me goover, and see the good land that [is] beyond Jordan, that goodlymountain, and Lebanon. 

{3:26} But the LORD was wroth with me for yoursakes, and would not hear me: and the LORD said unto me, Let it sufficethee; speak no more unto me of this matter. 

{3:27} Get thee up into thetop of Pisgah, and lift up thine eyes westward, and northward, andsouthward, and eastward, and behold [it] with thine eyes: for thoushalt not go over this Jordan. 

{3:28} But charge Joshua, and encouragehim, and strengthen him: for he shall go over before this people, andhe shall cause them to inherit the land which thou shalt see. 

{3:29} Sowe abode in the valley over against Beth- peor.   

{4:1} Now therefore hearken, O Israel, unto the statutes and untothe judgments, which I teach you, for to do [them,] that ye may live,and go in and possess the land which the LORD God of your fathersgiveth you. 

{4:2} Ye shall not add unto the word which I command you,neither shall ye diminish [ought] from it, that ye may keep thecommandments of the LORD your God which I command you. 

{4:3} Your eyeshave seen what the LORD did because of Baal-peor: for all the men thatfollowed Baal-peor, the LORD thy God hath destroyed them from amongyou. 

{4:4} But ye that did cleave unto the LORD your God [are] aliveevery one of you this day. 

{4:5} Behold, I have taught you statutes andjudgments, even as the LORD my God commanded me, that ye should do soin the land whither ye go to possess it. 

{4:6} Keep therefore and do[them;] for this [is] your wisdom and your understanding in the sightof the nations, which shall hear all these statutes, and say, Surelythis great nation [is] a wise and understanding people. 

{4:7} For whatnation [is there so] great, who [hath] God [so] nigh unto them, as theLORD our God [is] in all [things that] we call upon him [for? ]

{4:8}And what nation [is there so] great, that hath statutes and judgments[so] righteous as all this law, which I set before you this day? 

{4:9}Only take heed to thyself, and keep thy soul diligently, lest thouforget the things which thine eyes have seen, and lest they depart fromthy heart all the days of thy life: but teach them thy sons, and thysons' sons; 

{4:10} [Specially] the day that thou stoodest before theLORD thy God in Horeb, when the LORD said unto me, Gather me the peopletogether, and I will make them hear my words, that they may learn tofear me all the days that they shall live upon the earth, and [that]they may teach their children. 

{4:11} And ye came near and stood underthe mountain; and the mountain burned with fire unto the midst ofheaven, with darkness, clouds, and thick darkness. 

{4:12} And the LORDspake unto you out of the midst of the fire: ye heard the voice of thewords, but saw no similitude; only [ye heard] a voice. 

{4:13} And hedeclared unto you his covenant, which he commanded you to perform,[even] ten commandments; and he wrote them upon two tables of stone.   

{4:14} And the LORD commanded me at that time to teach you statutesand judgments, that ye might do them in the land whither ye go over topossess it. 

{4:15} Take ye therefore good heed unto yourselves; for yesaw no manner of similitude on the day [that] the LORD spake unto youin Horeb out of the midst of the fire: 

{4:16} Lest ye corrupt[yourselves,] and make you a graven image, the similitude of anyfigure, the likeness of male or female, 

{4:17} The likeness of anybeast that [is] on the earth, the likeness of any winged fowl thatflieth in the air, 

{4:18} The likeness of any thing that creepeth onthe ground, the likeness of any fish that [is] in the waters beneaththe earth: 

{4:19} And lest thou lift up thine eyes unto heaven, andwhen thou seest the sun, and the moon, and the stars, [even] all thehost of heaven, shouldest be driven to worship them, and serve them,which the LORD thy God hath divided unto all nations under the wholeheaven. 

{4:20} But the LORD hath taken you, and brought you forth outof the iron furnace, [even] out of Egypt, to be unto him a people ofinheritance, as [ye are] this day. 

{4:21} Furthermore the LORD wasangry with me for your sakes, and sware that I should not go overJordan, and that I should not go in unto that good land, which the LORDthy God giveth thee [for] an inheritance: 

{4:22} But I must die in thisland, I must not go over Jordan: but ye shall go over, and possess thatgood land. 

{4:23} Take heed unto yourselves, lest ye forget thecovenant of the LORD your God, which he made with you, and make you agraven image, [or] the likeness of any [thing,] which the LORD thy Godhath forbidden thee. 

{4:24} For the LORD thy God [is] a consuming fire,[even] a jealous God.   

{4:25} When thou shalt beget children, and children's children, andye shall have remained long in the land, and shall corrupt[yourselves,] and make a graven image, [or] the likeness of any[thing,] and shall do evil in the sight of the LORD thy God, to provokehim to anger: 

{4:26} I call heaven and earth to witness against youthis day, that ye shall soon utterly perish from off the land whereuntoye go over Jordan to possess it; ye shall not prolong [your] days uponit, but shall utterly be destroyed. 

{4:27} And the LORD shall scatteryou among the nations, and ye shall be left few in number among theheathen, whither the LORD shall lead you. 

{4:28} And there ye shallserve gods, the work of men's hands, wood and stone, which neither see,nor hear, nor eat, nor smell. 

{4:29} But if from thence thou shalt seekthe LORD thy God, thou shalt find [him,] if thou seek him with all thyheart and with all thy soul. 

{4:30} When thou art in tribulation, andall these things are come upon thee, [even] in the latter days, if thouturn to the LORD thy God, and shalt be obedient unto his voice; 

{4:31}(For the LORD thy God [is] a merciful God;) he will not forsake thee,neither destroy thee, nor forget the covenant of thy fathers which hesware unto them. 

{4:32} For ask now of the days that are past, whichwere before thee, since the day that God created man upon the earth,and [ask] from the one side of heaven unto the other, whether therehath been [any such thing] as this great thing [is,] or hath been heardlike it? 

{4:33} Did [ever] people hear the voice of God speaking out ofthe midst of the fire, as thou hast heard, and live? 

{4:34} Or hath Godassayed to go [and] take him a nation from the midst of another[nation,] by temptations, by signs, and by wonders, and by war, and bya mighty hand, and by a stretched out arm, and by great terrors,according to all that the LORD your God did for you in Egypt beforeyour eyes? 

{4:35} Unto thee it was shewed, that thou mightest know thatthe LORD he [is] God; [there is] none else beside him. 

{4:36} Out ofheaven he made thee to hear his voice, that he might instruct thee: andupon earth he shewed thee his great fire; and thou heardest his wordsout of the midst of the fire. 

{4:37} And because he loved thy fathers,therefore he chose their seed after them, and brought thee out in hissight with his mighty power out of Egypt; 

{4:38} To drive out nationsfrom before thee greater and mightier than thou [art,] to bring theein, to give thee their land [for] an inheritance, as [it is] this day.

{4:39} Know therefore this day, and consider [it] in thine heart, thatthe LORD he [is] God in heaven above, and upon the earth beneath:[there is] none else. 

{4:40} Thou shalt keep therefore his statutes,and his commandments, which I command thee this day, that it may gowell with thee, and with thy children after thee, and that thou mayestprolong [thy] days upon the earth, which the LORD thy God giveth thee,for ever.   

{4:41} Then Moses severed three cities on this side Jordan towardthe sunrising; 

{4:42} That the slayer might flee thither, which shouldkill his neighbour unawares, and hated him not in times past; and thatfleeing unto one of these cities he might live: 

{4:43} [Namely,] Bezerin the wilderness, in the plain country, of the Reubenites; and Ramothin Gilead, of the Gadites; and Golan in Bashan, of the Manassites.   

{4:44} And this is the law which Moses set before the children ofIsrael: 

{4:45} These [are] the testimonies, and the statutes, and thejudgments, which Moses spake unto the children of Israel, after theycame forth out of Egypt, 

{4:46} On this side Jordan, in the valley overagainst Beth-peor, in the land of Sihon king of the Amorites, who dweltat Heshbon, whom Moses and the children of Israel smote, after theywere come forth out of Egypt: 

{4:47} And they possessed his land, andthe land of Og king of Bashan, two kings of the Amorites, which [were]on this side Jordan toward the sunrising; 

{4:48} From Aroer, which [is]by the bank of the river Arnon, even unto mount Sion, which [is]Hermon, 

{4:49} And all the plain on this side Jordan eastward, evenunto the sea of the plain, under the springs of Pisgah.   

{5:1} And Moses called all Israel, and said unto them, Hear, OIsrael, the statutes and judgments which I speak in your ears this day,that ye may learn them, and keep, and do them. 

{5:2} The LORD our Godmade a covenant with us in Horeb. 

{5:3} The LORD made not this covenantwith our fathers, but with us, [even] us, who [are] all of us herealive this day. 

{5:4} The LORD talked with you face to face in themount out of the midst of the fire, 

{5:5} (I stood between the LORD andyou at that time, to shew you the word of the LORD: for ye were afraidby reason of the fire, and went not up into the mount;) saying,   

{5:6} I [am] the LORD thy God, which brought thee out of the land ofEgypt, from the house of bondage. 

{5:7} Thou shalt have none other godsbefore me. 

{5:8} Thou shalt not make thee [any] graven image, [or] anylikeness [of any thing] that [is] in heaven above, or that [is] in theearth beneath, or that [is] in the waters beneath the earth: 

{5:9} Thoushalt not bow down thyself unto them, nor serve them: for I the LORDthy God [am] a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers uponthe children unto the third and fourth [generation] of them that hateme, 

{5:10} And shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me andkeep my commandments. 

{5:11} Thou shalt not take the name of the LORDthy God in vain: for the LORD will not hold [him] guiltless that takethhis name in vain. 

{5:12} Keep the sabbath day to sanctify it, as theLORD thy God hath commanded thee. 

{5:13} Six days thou shalt labour,and do all thy work: 

{5:14} But the seventh day [is] the sabbath of theLORD thy God: [in it] thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son,nor thy daughter, nor thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thineox, nor thine ass, nor any of thy cattle, nor thy stranger that [is]within thy gates; that thy manservant and thy maidservant may rest aswell as thou. 

{5:15} And remember that thou wast a servant in the landof Egypt, and [that] the LORD thy God brought thee out thence through amighty hand and by a stretched out arm: therefore the LORD thy Godcommanded thee to keep the sabbath day.   

{5:16} Honour thy father and thy mother, as the LORD thy God hathcommanded thee; that thy days may be prolonged, and that it may go wellwith thee, in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee. 

{5:17} Thoushalt not kill. 

{5:18} Neither shalt thou commit adultery. 

{5:19}Neither shalt thou steal. 

{5:20} Neither shalt thou bear false witnessagainst thy neighbour. 

{5:21} Neither shalt thou desire thy neighbour'swife, neither shalt thou covet thy neighbour's house, his field, or hismanservant, or his maidservant, his ox, or his ass, or any [thing] that[is] thy neighbour's.   

{5:22} These words the LORD spake unto all your assembly in themount out of the midst of the fire, of the cloud, and of the thickdarkness, with a great voice: and he added no more. And he wrote themin two tables of stone, and delivered them unto me. 

{5:23} And it cameto pass, when ye heard the voice out of the midst of the darkness, (forthe mountain did burn with fire,) that ye came near unto me, [even] allthe heads of your tribes, and your elders; 

{5:24} And ye said, Behold,the LORD our God hath shewed us his glory and his greatness, and wehave heard his voice out of the midst of the fire: we have seen thisday that God doth talk with man, and he liveth. 

{5:25} Now thereforewhy should we die? for this great fire will consume us: if we hear thevoice of the LORD our God any more, then we shall die. 

{5:26} For who[is there of] all flesh, that hath heard the voice of the living Godspeaking out of the midst of the fire, as we [have,] and lived? 

{5:27}Go thou near, and hear all that the LORD our God shall say: and speakthou unto us all that the LORD our God shall speak unto thee; and wewill hear [it,] and do [it. ]

{5:28} And the LORD heard the voice ofyour words, when ye spake unto me; and the LORD said unto me, I haveheard the voice of the words of this people, which they have spokenunto thee: they have well said all that they have spoken. 

{5:29} O thatthere were such an heart in them, that they would fear me, and keep allmy commandments always, that it might be well with them, and with theirchildren for ever! 

{5:30} Go say to them, Get you into your tentsagain. 

{5:31} But as for thee, stand thou here by me, and I will speakunto thee all the commandments, and the statutes, and the judgments,which thou shalt teach them, that they may do [them] in the land whichI give them to possess it. 

{5:32} Ye shall observe to do therefore asthe LORD your God hath commanded you: ye shall not turn aside to theright hand or to the left. 

{5:33} Ye shall walk in all the ways whichthe LORD your God hath commanded you, that ye may live, and [that itmay be] well with you, and [that] ye may prolong [your] days in theland which ye shall possess.   

{6:1} Now these [are] the commandments, the statutes, and thejudgments, which the LORD your God commanded to teach you, that yemight do [them] in the land whither ye go to possess it: 

{6:2} Thatthou mightest fear the LORD thy God, to keep all his statutes and hiscommandments, which I command thee, thou, and thy son, and thy son'sson, all the days of thy life; and that thy days may be prolonged.   

{6:3} Hear therefore, O Israel, and observe to do [it;] that it maybe well with thee, and that ye may increase mightily, as the LORD Godof thy fathers hath promised thee, in the land that floweth with milkand honey. 

{6:4} Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God [is] one LORD: 

{6:5}And thou shalt love the LORD thy God with all thine heart, and with allthy soul, and with all thy might. 

{6:6} And these words, which Icommand thee this day, shall be in thine heart: 

{6:7} And thou shaltteach them diligently unto thy children, and shalt talk of them whenthou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, and whenthou liest down, and when thou risest up. 

{6:8} And thou shalt bindthem for a sign upon thine hand, and they shall be as frontlets betweenthine eyes. 

{6:9} And thou shalt write them upon the posts of thyhouse, and on thy gates. 

{6:10} And it shall be, when the LORD thy Godshall have brought thee into the land which he sware unto thy fathers,to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give thee great and goodlycities, which thou buildedst not, 

{6:11} And houses full of all good[things,] which thou filledst not, and wells digged, which thoudiggedst not, vineyards and olive trees, which thou plantedst not; whenthou shalt have eaten and be full; 

{6:12} [Then] beware lest thouforget the LORD, which brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt,from the house of bondage. 

{6:13} Thou shalt fear the LORD thy God, andserve him, and shalt swear by his name. 

{6:14} Ye shall not go afterother gods, of the gods of the people which [are] round about you;

{6:15} (For the LORD thy God [is] a jealous God among you) lest theanger of the LORD thy God be kindled against thee, and destroy theefrom off the face of the earth.   

{6:16} Ye shall not tempt the LORD your God, as ye tempted [him] inMassah. 

{6:17} Ye shall diligently keep the commandments of the LORDyour God, and his testimonies, and his statutes, which he hathcommanded thee. 

{6:18} And thou shalt do [that which is] right and goodin the sight of the LORD: that it may be well with thee, and that thoumayest go in and possess the good land which the LORD sware unto thyfathers, 

{6:19} To cast out all thine enemies from before thee, as theLORD hath spoken. 

{6:20} [And] when thy son asketh thee in time tocome, saying, What [mean] the testimonies, and the statutes, and thejudgments, which the LORD our God hath commanded you? 

{6:21} Then thoushalt say unto thy son, We were Pharaoh's bondmen in Egypt; and theLORD brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand: 

{6:22} And the LORDshewed signs and wonders, great and sore, upon Egypt, upon Pharaoh, andupon all his household, before our eyes: 

{6:23} And he brought us outfrom thence, that he might bring us in, to give us the land which hesware unto our fathers. 

{6:24} And the LORD commanded us to do allthese statutes, to fear the LORD our God, for our good always, that hemight preserve us alive, as [it is] at this day. 

{6:25} And it shall beour righteousness, if we observe to do all these commandments beforethe LORD our God, as he hath commanded us.   

{7:1} When the LORD thy God shall bring thee into the land whitherthou goest to possess it, and hath cast out many nations before thee,the Hittites, and the Girgashites, and the Amorites, and theCanaanites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites,seven nations greater and mightier than thou; 

{7:2} And when the LORDthy God shall deliver them before thee; thou shalt smite them, [and]utterly destroy them; thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor shewmercy unto them: 

{7:3} Neither shalt thou make marriages with them; thydaughter thou shalt not give unto his son, nor his daughter shalt thoutake unto thy son. 

{7:4} For they will turn away thy son from followingme, that they may serve other gods: so will the anger of the LORD bekindled against you, and destroy thee suddenly. 

{7:5} But thus shall yedeal with them; ye shall destroy their altars, and break down theirimages, and cut down their groves, and burn their graven images withfire. 

{7:6} For thou [art] an holy people unto the LORD thy God: theLORD thy God hath chosen thee to be a special people unto himself,above all people that [are] upon the face of the earth. 

{7:7} The LORDdid not set his love upon you, nor choose you, because ye were more innumber than any people; for ye [were] the fewest of all people: 

{7:8}But because the LORD loved you, and because he would keep the oathwhich he had sworn unto your fathers, hath the LORD brought you outwith a mighty hand, and redeemed you out of the house of bondmen, fromthe hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt. 

{7:9} Know therefore that the LORDthy God, he [is] God, the faithful God, which keepeth covenant andmercy with them that love him and keep his commandments to a thousandgenerations; 

{7:10} And repayeth them that hate him to their face, todestroy them: he will not be slack to him that hateth him, he willrepay him to his face. 

{7:11} Thou shalt therefore keep thecommandments, and the statutes, and the judgments, which I command theethis day, to do them.   

{7:12} Wherefore it shall come to pass, if ye hearken to thesejudgments, and keep, and do them, that the LORD thy God shall keep untothee the covenant and the mercy which he sware unto thy fathers: 

{7:13}And he will love thee, and bless thee, and multiply thee: he will alsobless the fruit of thy womb, and the fruit of thy land, thy corn, andthy wine, and thine oil, the increase of thy kine, and the flocks ofthy sheep, in the land which he sware unto thy fathers to give thee.

{7:14} Thou shalt be blessed above all people: there shall not be maleor female barren among you, or among your cattle. 

{7:15} And the LORDwill take away from thee all sickness, and will put none of the evildiseases of Egypt, which thou knowest, upon thee; but will lay themupon all [them] that hate thee. 

{7:16} And thou shalt consume all thepeople which the LORD thy God shall deliver thee; thine eye shall haveno pity upon them: neither shalt thou serve their gods; for that [willbe] a snare unto thee. 

{7:17} If thou shalt say in thine heart, Thesenations [are] more than I; how can I dispossess them? 

{7:18} Thou shaltnot be afraid of them: [but] shalt well remember what the LORD thy Goddid unto Pharaoh, and unto all Egypt; 

{7:19} The great temptationswhich thine eyes saw, and the signs, and the wonders, and the mightyhand, and the stretched out arm, whereby the LORD thy God brought theeout: so shall the LORD thy God do unto all the people of whom thou artafraid. 

{7:20} Moreover the LORD thy God will send the hornet amongthem, until they that are left, and hide themselves from thee, bedestroyed. 

{7:21} Thou shalt not be affrighted at them: for the LORDthy God [is] among you, a mighty God and terrible. 

{7:22} And the LORDthy God will put out those nations before thee by little and little:thou mayest not consume them at once, lest the beasts of the fieldincrease upon thee. 

{7:23} But the LORD thy God shall deliver them untothee, and shall destroy them with a mighty destruction, until they bedestroyed. 

{7:24} And he shall deliver their kings into thine hand, andthou shalt destroy their name from under heaven: there shall no man beable to stand before thee, until thou have destroyed them. 

{7:25} Thegraven images of their gods shall ye burn with fire: thou shalt notdesire the silver or gold [that is] on them, nor take [it] unto thee,lest thou be snared therein: for it [is] an abomination to the LORD thyGod. 

{7:26} Neither shalt thou bring an abomination into thine house,lest thou be a cursed thing like it: [but] thou shalt utterly detestit, and thou shalt utterly abhor it; for it [is] a cursed thing.   

{8:1} All the commandments which I command thee this day shall yeobserve to do, that ye may live, and multiply, and go in and possessthe land which the LORD sware unto your fathers. 

{8:2} And thou shaltremember all the way which the LORD thy God led thee these forty yearsin the wilderness, to humble thee, [and] to prove thee, to know what[was] in thine heart, whether thou wouldest keep his commandments, orno. 

{8:3} And he humbled thee, and suffered thee to hunger, and fedthee with manna, which thou knewest not, neither did thy fathers know;that he might make thee know that man doth not live by bread only, butby every [word] that proceedeth out of the mouth of the LORD doth manlive. 

{8:4} Thy raiment waxed not old upon thee, neither did thy footswell, these forty years. 

{8:5} Thou shalt also consider in thineheart, that, as a man chasteneth his son, [so] the LORD thy Godchasteneth thee. 

{8:6} Therefore thou shalt keep the commandments ofthe LORD thy God, to walk in his ways, and to fear him. 

{8:7} For theLORD thy God bringeth thee into a good land, a land of brooks of water,of fountains and depths that spring out of valleys and hills; 

{8:8} Aland of wheat, and barley, and vines, and fig trees, and pomegranates;a land of oil olive, and honey; 

{8:9} A land wherein thou shalt eatbread without scarceness, thou shalt not lack any [thing] in it; a landwhose stones are iron, and out of whose hills thou mayest dig brass.

{8:10} When thou hast eaten and art full, then thou shalt bless theLORD thy God for the good land which he hath given thee. 

{8:11} Bewarethat thou forget not the LORD thy God, in not keeping his commandments,and his judgments, and his statutes, which I command thee this day:

{8:12} Lest [when] thou hast eaten and art full, and hast built goodlyhouses, and dwelt [therein; ]

{8:13} And [when] thy herds and thy flocksmultiply, and thy silver and thy gold is multiplied, and all that thouhast is multiplied; 

{8:14} Then thine heart be lifted up, and thouforget the LORD thy God, which brought thee forth out of the land ofEgypt, from the house of bondage; 

{8:15} Who led thee through thatgreat and terrible wilderness, [wherein were] fiery serpents, andscorpions, and drought, where [there was] no water; who brought theeforth water out of the rock of flint; 

{8:16} Who fed thee in thewilderness with manna, which thy fathers knew not, that he might humblethee, and that he might prove thee, to do thee good at thy latter end;

{8:17} And thou say in thine heart, My power and the might of [mine]hand hath gotten me this wealth. 

{8:18} But thou shalt remember theLORD thy God: for [it is] he that giveth thee power to get wealth, thathe may establish his covenant which he sware unto thy fathers, as [itis] this day. 

{8:19} And it shall be, if thou do at all forget the LORDthy God, and walk after other gods, and serve them, and worship them, Itestify against you this day that ye shall surely perish. 

{8:20} As thenations which the LORD destroyeth before your face, so shall ye perish;because ye would not be obedient unto the voice of the LORD your God.   

{9:1} Hear, O Israel: Thou [art] to pass over Jordan this day, to goin to possess nations greater and mightier than thyself, cities greatand fenced up to heaven, 

{9:2} A people great and tall, the children ofthe Anakims, whom thou knowest, and [of whom] thou hast heard [say,]Who can stand before the children of Anak! 

{9:3} Understand thereforethis day, that the LORD thy God [is] he which goeth over before thee;[as] a consuming fire he shall destroy them, and he shall bring themdown before thy face: so shalt thou drive them out, and destroy themquickly, as the LORD hath said unto thee. 

{9:4} Speak not thou in thineheart, after that the LORD thy God hath cast them out from before thee,saying, For my righteousness the LORD hath brought me in to possessthis land: but for the wickedness of these nations the LORD doth drivethem out from before thee. 

{9:5} Not for thy righteousness, or for theuprightness of thine heart, dost thou go to possess their land: but forthe wickedness of these nations the LORD thy God doth drive them outfrom before thee, and that he may perform the word which the LORD swareunto thy fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. 

{9:6} Understandtherefore, that the LORD thy God giveth thee not this good land topossess it for thy righteousness; for thou [art] a stiffnecked people.   

{9:7} Remember, [and] forget not, how thou provokedst the LORD thyGod to wrath in the wilderness: from the day that thou didst depart outof the land of Egypt, until ye came unto this place, ye have beenrebellious against the LORD. 

{9:8} Also in Horeb ye provoked the LORDto wrath, so that the LORD was angry with you to have destroyed you.

{9:9} When I was gone up into the mount to receive the tables of stone,[even] the tables of the covenant which the LORD made with you, then Iabode in the mount forty days and forty nights, I neither did eat breadnor drink water: 

{9:10} And the LORD delivered unto me two tables ofstone written with the finger of God; and on them [was written]according to all the words, which the LORD spake with you in the mountout of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly. 

{9:11} And itcame to pass at the end of forty days and forty nights, [that] the LORDgave me the two tables of stone, [even] the tables of the covenant.

{9:12} And the LORD said unto me, Arise, get thee down quickly fromhence; for thy people which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt havecorrupted [themselves;] they are quickly turned aside out of the waywhich I commanded them; they have made them a molten image. 

{9:13}Furthermore the LORD spake unto me, saying, I have seen this people,and, behold, it [is] a stiffnecked people: 

{9:14} Let me alone, that Imay destroy them, and blot out their name from under heaven: and I willmake of thee a nation mightier and greater than they. 

{9:15} So Iturned and came down from the mount, and the mount burned with fire:and the two tables of the covenant [were] in my two hands. 

{9:16} And Ilooked, and, behold, ye had sinned against the LORD your God, [and] hadmade you a molten calf: ye had turned aside quickly out of the waywhich the LORD had commanded you. 

{9:17} And I took the two tables, andcast them out of my two hands, and brake them before your eyes. 

{9:18}And I fell down before the LORD, as at the first, forty days and fortynights: I did neither eat bread, nor drink water, because of all yoursins which ye sinned, in doing wickedly in the sight of the LORD, toprovoke him to anger. 

{9:19} For I was afraid of the anger and hotdispleasure, wherewith the LORD was wroth against you to destroy you.But the LORD hearkened unto me at that time also. 

{9:20} And the LORDwas very angry with Aaron to have destroyed him: and I prayed for Aaronalso the same time. 

{9:21} And I took your sin, the calf which ye hadmade, and burnt it with fire, and stamped it, [and] ground [it] verysmall, [even] until it was as small as dust: and I cast the dustthereof into the brook that descended out of the mount. 

{9:22} And atTaberah, and at Massah, and at Kibroth-hattaavah, ye provoked the LORDto wrath. 

{9:23} Likewise when the LORD sent you from Kadesh-barnea,saying, Go up and possess the land which I have given you; then yerebelled against the commandment of the LORD your God, and ye believedhim not, nor hearkened to his voice. 

{9:24} Ye have been rebelliousagainst the LORD from the day that I knew you. 

{9:25} Thus I fell downbefore the LORD forty days and forty nights, as I fell down [at thefirst;] because the LORD had said he would destroy you. 

{9:26} I prayedtherefore unto the LORD, and said, O Lord GOD, destroy not thy peopleand thine inheritance, which thou hast redeemed through thy greatness,which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand. 

{9:27}Remember thy servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; look not unto thestubbornness of this people, nor to their wickedness, nor to their sin:

{9:28} Lest the land whence thou broughtest us out say, Because theLORD was not able to bring them into the land which he promised them,and because he hated them, he hath brought them out to slay them in thewilderness. 

{9:29} Yet they [are] thy people and thine inheritance,which thou broughtest out by thy mighty power and by thy stretched outarm.   

{10:1} At that time the LORD said unto me, Hew thee two tables ofstone like unto the first, and come up unto me into the mount, and makethee an ark of wood. 

{10:2} And I will write on the tables the wordsthat were in the first tables which thou brakest, and thou shalt putthem in the ark. 

{10:3} And I made an ark [of] shittim wood, and hewedtwo tables of stone like unto the first, and went up into the mount,having the two tables in mine hand. 

{10:4} And he wrote on the tables,according to the first writing, the ten commandments, which the LORDspake unto you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day ofthe assembly: and the LORD gave them unto me. 

{10:5} And I turnedmyself and came down from the mount, and put the tables in the arkwhich I had made; and there they be, as the LORD commanded me.   

{10:6} And the children of Israel took their journey from Beeroth ofthe children of Jaakan to Mosera: there Aaron died, and there he wasburied; and Eleazar his son ministered in the priest's office in hisstead. 

{10:7} From thence they journeyed unto Gudgodah; and fromGudgodah to Jotbath, a land of rivers of waters.   

{10:8} At that time the LORD separated the tribe of Levi, to bearthe ark of the covenant of the LORD, to stand before the LORD tominister unto him, and to bless in his name, unto this day. 

{10:9}Wherefore Levi hath no part nor inheritance with his brethren; the LORD[is] his inheritance, according as the LORD thy God promised him.

{10:10} And I stayed in the mount, according to the first time, fortydays and forty nights; and the LORD hearkened unto me at that timealso, [and] the LORD would not destroy thee. 

{10:11} And the LORD saidunto me, Arise, take [thy] journey before the people, that they may goin and possess the land, which I sware unto their fathers to give untothem.   

{10:12} And now, Israel, what doth the LORD thy God require of thee,but to fear the LORD thy God, to walk in all his ways, and to love him,and to serve the LORD thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul,

{10:13} To keep the commandments of the LORD, and his statutes, which Icommand thee this day for thy good? 

{10:14} Behold, the heaven and theheaven of heavens [is] the LORD'S thy God, the earth [also,] with allthat therein [is. ]

{10:15} Only the LORD had a delight in thy fathersto love them, and he chose their seed after them, [even] you above allpeople, as [it is] this day. 

{10:16} Circumcise therefore the foreskinof your heart, and be no more stiffnecked. 

{10:17} For the LORD yourGod [is] God of gods, and Lord of lords, a great God, a mighty, and aterrible, which regardeth not persons, nor taketh reward: 

{10:18} Hedoth execute the judgment of the fatherless and widow, and loveth thestranger, in giving him food and raiment. 

{10:19} Love ye therefore thestranger: for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt. 

{10:20} Thoushalt fear the LORD thy God; him shalt thou serve, and to him shaltthou cleave, and swear by his name. 

{10:21} He [is] thy praise, and he[is] thy God, that hath done for thee these great and terrible things,which thine eyes have seen. 

{10:22} Thy fathers went down into Egyptwith threescore and ten persons; and now the LORD thy God hath madethee as the stars of heaven for multitude.   

{11:1} Therefore thou shalt love the LORD thy God, and keep hischarge, and his statutes, and his judgments, and his commandments,alway. 

{11:2} And know ye this day: for [I speak] not with yourchildren which have not known, and which have not seen the chastisementof the LORD your God, his greatness, his mighty hand, and his stretchedout arm, 

{11:3} And his miracles, and his acts, which he did in themidst of Egypt unto Pharaoh the king of Egypt, and unto all his land;

{11:4} And what he did unto the army of Egypt, unto their horses, andto their chariots; how he made the water of the Red sea to overflowthem as they pursued after you, and [how] the LORD hath destroyed themunto this day; 

{11:5} And what he did unto you in the wilderness, untilye came into this place; 

{11:6} And what he did unto Dathan and Abiram,the sons of Eliab, the son of Reuben: how the earth opened her mouth,and swallowed them up, and their households, and their tents, and allthe substance that [was] in their possession, in the midst of allIsrael: 

{11:7} But your eyes have seen all the great acts of the LORDwhich he did. 

{11:8} Therefore shall ye keep all the commandments whichI command you this day, that ye may be strong, and go in and possessthe land, whither ye go to possess it; 

{11:9} And that ye may prolong[your] days in the land, which the LORD sware unto your fathers to giveunto them and to their seed, a land that floweth with milk and honey.   

{11:10} For the land, whither thou goest in to possess it, [is] notas the land of Egypt, from whence ye came out, where thou sowedst thyseed, and wateredst [it] with thy foot, as a garden of herbs: 

{11:11}But the land, whither ye go to possess it, [is] a land of hills [and]valleys, and drinketh water of the rain of heaven: 

{11:12} A land whichthe LORD thy God careth for: the eyes of the LORD thy God [are] alwaysupon it, from the beginning of the year even unto the end of the year.   

{11:13} And it shall come to pass, if ye shall hearken diligentlyunto my commandments which I command you this day, to love the LORDyour God, and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul,

{11:14} That I will give [you] the rain of your land in his due season,the first rain and the latter rain, that thou mayest gather in thycorn, and thy wine, and thine oil. 

{11:15} And I will send grass in thyfields for thy cattle, that thou mayest eat and be full. 

{11:16} Takeheed to yourselves, that your heart be not deceived, and ye turn aside,and serve other gods, and worship them; 

{11:17} And [then] the LORD'Swrath be kindled against you, and he shut up the heaven, that there beno rain, and that the land yield not her fruit; and [lest] ye perishquickly from off the good land which the LORD giveth you.   

{11:18} Therefore shall ye lay up these my words in your heart andin your soul, and bind them for a sign upon your hand, that they may beas frontlets between your eyes. 

{11:19} And ye shall teach them yourchildren, speaking of them when thou sittest in thine house, and whenthou walkest by the way, when thou liest down, and when thou risest up.

{11:20} And thou shalt write them upon the door posts of thine house,and upon thy gates: 

{11:21} That your days may be multiplied, and thedays of your children, in the land which the LORD sware unto yourfathers to give them, as the days of heaven upon the earth.   

{11:22} For if ye shall diligently keep all these commandments whichI command you, to do them, to love the LORD your God, to walk in allhis ways, and to cleave unto him; 

{11:23} Then will the LORD drive outall these nations from before you, and ye shall possess greater nationsand mightier than yourselves. 

{11:24} Every place whereon the soles ofyour feet shall tread shall be yours: from the wilderness and Lebanon,from the river, the river Euphrates, even unto the uttermost sea shallyour coast be. 

{11:25} There shall no man be able to stand before you:[for] the LORD your God shall lay the fear of you and the dread of youupon all the land that ye shall tread upon, as he hath said unto you.   

{11:26} Behold, I set before you this day a blessing and a curse;

{11:27} A blessing, if ye obey the commandments of the LORD your God,which I command you this day: 

{11:28} And a curse, if ye will not obeythe commandments of the LORD your God, but turn aside out of the waywhich I command you this day, to go after other gods, which ye have notknown. 

{11:29} And it shall come to pass, when the LORD thy God hathbrought thee in unto the land whither thou goest to possess it, thatthou shalt put the blessing upon mount Gerizim, and the curse uponmount Ebal. 

{11:30} [Are] they not on the other side Jordan, by the waywhere the sun goeth down, in the land of the Canaanites, which dwell inthe champaign over against Gilgal, beside the plains of Moreh? 

{11:31}For ye shall pass over Jordan to go in to possess the land which theLORD your God giveth you, and ye shall possess it, and dwell therein.

{11:32} And ye shall observe to do all the statutes and judgments whichI set before you this day.   

{12:1} These [are] the statutes and judgments, which ye shallobserve to do in the land, which the LORD God of thy fathers giveththee to possess it, all the days that ye live upon the earth. 

{12:2} Yeshall utterly destroy all the places, wherein the nations which yeshall possess served their gods, upon the high mountains, and upon thehills, and under every green tree: 

{12:3} And ye shall overthrow theiraltars, and break their pillars, and burn their groves with fire; andye shall hew down the graven images of their gods, and destroy thenames of them out of that place. 

{12:4} Ye shall not do so unto theLORD your God. 

{12:5} But unto the place which the LORD your God shallchoose out of all your tribes to put his name there, [even] unto hishabitation shall ye seek, and thither thou shalt come: 

{12:6} Andthither ye shall bring your burnt offerings, and your sacrifices, andyour tithes, and heave offerings of your hand, and your vows, and yourfreewill offerings, and the firstlings of your herds and of yourflocks: 

{12:7} And there ye shall eat before the LORD your God, and yeshall rejoice in all that ye put your hand unto, ye and yourhouseholds, wherein the LORD thy God hath blessed thee. 

{12:8} Ye shallnot do after all [the things] that we do here this day, every manwhatsoever [is] right in his own eyes. 

{12:9} For ye are not as yetcome to the rest and to the inheritance, which the LORD your God givethyou. 

{12:10} But [when] ye go over Jordan, and dwell in the land whichthe LORD your God giveth you to inherit, and [when] he giveth you restfrom all your enemies round about, so that ye dwell in safety; 

{12:11}Then there shall be a place which the LORD your God shall choose tocause his name to dwell there; thither shall ye bring all that Icommand you; your burnt offerings, and your sacrifices, your tithes,and the heave offering of your hand, and all your choice vows which yevow unto the LORD: 

{12:12} And ye shall rejoice before the LORD yourGod, ye, and your sons, and your daughters, and your menservants, andyour maidservants, and the Levite that [is] within your gates;forasmuch as he hath no part nor inheritance with you. 

{12:13} Takeheed to thyself that thou offer not thy burnt offerings in every placethat thou seest: 

{12:14} But in the place which the LORD shall choosein one of thy tribes, there thou shalt offer thy burnt offerings, andthere thou shalt do all that I command thee. 

{12:15} Notwithstandingthou mayest kill and eat flesh in all thy gates, whatsoever thy soullusteth after, according to the blessing of the LORD thy God which hehath given thee: the unclean and the clean may eat thereof, as of theroebuck, and as of the hart. 

{12:16} Only ye shall not eat the blood;ye shall pour it upon the earth as water.   

{12:17} Thou mayest not eat within thy gates the tithe of thy corn,or of thy wine, or of thy oil, or the firstlings of thy herds or of thyflock, nor any of thy vows which thou vowest, nor thy freewillofferings, or heave offering of thine hand: 

{12:18} But thou must eatthem before the LORD thy God in the place which the LORD thy God shallchoose, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, and thy manservant, andthy maidservant, and the Levite that [is] within thy gates: and thoushalt rejoice before the LORD thy God in all that thou puttest thinehands unto. 

{12:19} Take heed to thyself that thou forsake not theLevite as long as thou livest upon the earth.   

{12:20} When the LORD thy God shall enlarge thy border, as he hathpromised thee, and thou shalt say, I will eat flesh, because thy soullongeth to eat flesh; thou mayest eat flesh, whatsoever thy soullusteth after. 

{12:21} If the place which the LORD thy God hath chosento put his name there be too far from thee, then thou shalt kill of thyherd and of thy flock, which the LORD hath given thee, as I havecommanded thee, and thou shalt eat in thy gates whatsoever thy soullusteth after. 

{12:22} Even as the roebuck and the hart is eaten, sothou shalt eat them: the unclean and the clean shall eat [of] themalike. 

{12:23} Only be sure that thou eat not the blood: for the blood[is] the life; and thou mayest not eat the life with the flesh. 

{12:24}Thou shalt not eat it; thou shalt pour it upon the earth as water.

{12:25} Thou shalt not eat it; that it may go well with thee, and withthy children after thee, when thou shalt do [that which is] right inthe sight of the LORD. 

{12:26} Only thy holy things which thou hast,and thy vows, thou shalt take, and go unto the place which the LORDshall choose: 

{12:27} And thou shalt offer thy burnt offerings, theflesh and the blood, upon the altar of the LORD thy God: and the bloodof thy sacrifices shall be poured out upon the altar of the LORD thyGod, and thou shalt eat the flesh. 

{12:28} Observe and hear all thesewords which I command thee, that it may go well with thee, and with thychildren after thee for ever, when thou doest [that which is] good andright in the sight of the LORD thy God.   

{12:29} When the LORD thy God shall cut off the nations from beforethee, whither thou goest to possess them, and thou succeedest them, anddwellest in their land; 

{12:30} Take heed to thyself that thou be notsnared by following them, after that they be destroyed from beforethee; and that thou enquire not after their gods, saying, How did thesenations serve their gods? even so will I do likewise. 

{12:31} Thoushalt not do so unto the LORD thy God: for every abomination to theLORD, which he hateth, have they done unto their gods; for even theirsons and their daughters they have burnt in the fire to their gods.

{12:32} What thing soever I command you, observe to do it: thou shaltnot add thereto, nor diminish from it.   

{13:1} If there arise among you a prophet, or a dreamer of dreams,and giveth thee a sign or a wonder, 

{13:2} And the sign or the wondercome to pass, whereof he spake unto thee, saying, Let us go after othergods, which thou hast not known, and let us serve them; 

{13:3} Thoushalt not hearken unto the words of that prophet, or that dreamer ofdreams: for the LORD your God proveth you, to know whether ye love theLORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul. 

{13:4} Yeshall walk after the LORD your God, and fear him, and keep hiscommandments, and obey his voice, and ye shall serve him, and cleaveunto him. 

{13:5} And that prophet, or that dreamer of dreams, shall beput to death; because he hath spoken to turn [you] away from the LORDyour God, which brought you out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed youout of the house of bondage, to thrust thee out of the way which theLORD thy God commanded thee to walk in. So shalt thou put the evil awayfrom the midst of thee.   

{13:6} If thy brother, the son of thy mother, or thy son, or thydaughter, or the wife of thy bosom, or thy friend, which [is] as thineown soul, entice thee secretly, saying, Let us go and serve other gods,which thou hast not known, thou, nor thy fathers; 

{13:7} [Namely,] ofthe gods of the people which [are] round about you, nigh unto thee, orfar off from thee, from the [one] end of the earth even unto the[other] end of the earth; 

{13:8} Thou shalt not consent unto him, norhearken unto him; neither shall thine eye pity him, neither shalt thouspare, neither shalt thou conceal him: 

{13:9} But thou shalt surelykill him; thine hand shall be first upon him to put him to death, andafterwards the hand of all the people. 

{13:10} And thou shalt stone himwith stones, that he die; because he hath sought to thrust thee awayfrom the LORD thy God, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt,from the house of bondage. 

{13:11} And all Israel shall hear, and fear,and shall do no more any such wickedness as this is among you.   

{13:12} If thou shalt hear [say] in one of thy cities, which theLORD thy God hath given thee to dwell there, saying, 

{13:13} [Certain]men, the children of Belial, are gone out from among you, and havewithdrawn the inhabitants of their city, saying, Let us go and serveother gods, which ye have not known; 

{13:14} Then shalt thou enquire,and make search, and ask diligently; and, behold, [if it be] truth,[and] the thing certain, [that] such abomination is wrought among you;

{13:15} Thou shalt surely smite the inhabitants of that city with theedge of the sword, destroying it utterly, and all that [is] therein,and the cattle thereof, with the edge of the sword. 

{13:16} And thoushalt gather all the spoil of it into the midst of the street thereof,and shalt burn with fire the city, and all the spoil thereof everywhit, for the LORD thy God: and it shall be an heap for ever; it shallnot be built again. 

{13:17} And there shall cleave nought of the cursedthing to thine hand: that the LORD may turn from the fierceness of hisanger, and shew thee mercy, and have compassion upon thee, and multiplythee, as he hath sworn unto thy fathers; 

{13:18} When thou shalthearken to the voice of the LORD thy God, to keep all his commandmentswhich I command thee this day, to do [that which is] right in the eyesof the LORD thy God.   

{14:1} Ye [are] the children of the LORD your God: ye shall not cutyourselves, nor make any baldness between your eyes for the dead.

{14:2} for thou [art] an holy people unto the LORD thy God, and theLORD hath chosen thee to be a peculiar people unto himself, above allthe nations that [are] upon the earth.   

{14:3} Thou shalt not eat any abominable thing. 

{14:4} These [are]the beasts which ye shall eat: the ox, the sheep, and the goat, 

{14:5}The hart, and the roebuck, and the fallow deer, and the wild goat, andthe pygarg, and the wild ox, and the chamois. 

{14:6} And every beastthat parteth the hoof, and cleaveth the cleft into two claws, [and]cheweth the cud among the beasts, that ye shall eat. 

{14:7}Nevertheless these ye shall not eat of them that chew the cud, or ofthem that divide the cloven hoof; [as] the camel, and the hare, and theconey: for they chew the cud, but divide not the hoof; [therefore] they[are] unclean unto you. 

{14:8} And the swine, because it divideth thehoof, yet cheweth not the cud, it is unclean unto you: ye shall not eatof their flesh, nor touch their dead carcase.   

{14:9} These ye shall eat of all that [are] in the waters: all thathave fins and scales shall ye eat: 

{14:10} And whatsoever hath not finsand scales ye may not eat; it [is] unclean unto you.   

{14:11} [Of] all clean birds ye shall eat. 

{14:12} But these [arethey] of which ye shall not eat: the eagle, and ossifrage, and theospray, 

{14:13} And the glede, and the kite, and the vulture after hiskind, 

{14:14} And every raven after his kind, 

{14:15} And the owl, andthe night hawk, and the cuckow, and the hawk after his kind, 

{14:16}The little owl, and the great owl, and the swan, 

{14:17} And thepelican, and the gier eagle, and the cormorant, 

{14:18} And the stork,and the heron after her kind, and the lapwing, and the bat. 

{14:19} Andevery creeping thing that flieth [is] unclean unto you: they shall notbe eaten. 

{14:20} [But of] all clean fowls ye may eat.   

{14:21} Ye shall not eat [of] any thing that dieth of itself: thoushalt give it unto the stranger that [is] in thy gates, that he may eatit; or thou mayest sell it unto an alien: for thou [art] an holy peopleunto the LORD thy God. Thou shalt not seethe a kid in his mother'smilk. 

{14:22} Thou shalt truly tithe all the increase of thy seed, thatthe field bringeth forth year by year. 

{14:23} And thou shalt eatbefore the LORD thy God, in the place which he shall choose to placehis name there, the tithe of thy corn, of thy wine, and of thine oil,and the firstlings of thy herds and of thy flocks; that thou mayestlearn to fear the LORD thy God always. 

{14:24} And if the way be toolong for thee, so that thou art not able to carry it; [or] if the placebe too far from thee, which the LORD thy God shall choose to set hisname there, when the LORD thy God hath blessed thee: 

{14:25} Then shaltthou turn [it] into money, and bind up the money in thine hand, andshalt go unto the place which the LORD thy God shall choose: 

{14:26}And thou shalt bestow that money for whatsoever thy soul lusteth after,for oxen, or for sheep, or for wine, or for strong drink, or forwhatsoever thy soul desireth: and thou shalt eat there before the LORDthy God, and thou shalt rejoice, thou, and thine household, 

{14:27} Andthe Levite that [is] within thy gates; thou shalt not forsake him; forhe hath no part nor inheritance with thee.   

{14:28} At the end of three years thou shalt bring forth all thetithe of thine increase the same year, and shalt lay [it] up within thygates: 

{14:29} And the Levite, (because he hath no part nor inheritancewith thee,) and the stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow, which[are] within thy gates, shall come, and shall eat and be satisfied;that the LORD thy God may bless thee in all the work of thine handwhich thou doest.   

{15:1} At the end of [every] seven years thou shalt make a release.

{15:2} And this [is] the manner of the release: Every creditor thatlendeth [ought] unto his neighbour shall release [it;] he shall notexact [it] of his neighbour, or of his brother; because it is calledthe LORD'S release. 

{15:3} Of a foreigner thou mayest exact [it again:]but [that] which is thine with thy brother thine hand shall release;

{15:4} Save when there shall be no poor among you; for the LORD shallgreatly bless thee in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee [for]an inheritance to possess it: 

{15:5} Only if thou carefully hearkenunto the voice of the LORD thy God, to observe to do all thesecommandments which I command thee this day. 

{15:6} For the LORD thy Godblesseth thee, as he promised thee: and thou shalt lend unto manynations, but thou shalt not borrow; and thou shalt reign over manynations,but they shall not reign over thee.   

{15:7} If there be among you a poor man of one of thy brethrenwithin any of thy gates in thy land which the LORD thy God giveth thee,thou shalt not harden thine heart, nor shut thine hand from thy poorbrother: 

{15:8} But thou shalt open thine hand wide unto him, and shaltsurely lend him sufficient for his need, [in that] which he wanteth.

{15:9} Beware that there be not a thought in thy wicked heart, saying,The seventh year, the year of release, is at hand; and thine eye beevil against thy poor brother, and thou givest him nought; and he cryunto the LORD against thee, and it be sin unto thee. 

{15:10} Thou shaltsurely give him, and thine heart shall not be grieved when thou givestunto him: because that for this thing the LORD thy God shall bless theein all thy works, and in all that thou puttest thine hand unto. 

{15:11}For the poor shall never cease out of the land: therefore I commandthee, saying, Thou shalt open thine hand wide unto thy brother, to thypoor, and to thy needy, in thy land.   

{15:12} [And] if thy brother, an Hebrew man, or an Hebrew woman, besold unto thee, and serve thee six years; then in the seventh year thoushalt let him go free from thee. 

{15:13} And when thou sendest him outfree from thee, thou shalt not let him go away empty: 

{15:14} Thoushalt furnish him liberally out of thy flock, and out of thy floor, andout of thy winepress: [of that] wherewith the LORD thy God hath blessedthee thou shalt give unto him. 

{15:15} And thou shalt remember thatthou wast a bondman in the land of Egypt, and the LORD thy God redeemedthee: therefore I command thee this thing to day. 

{15:16} And it shallbe, if he say unto thee, I will not go away from thee; because heloveth thee and thine house, because he is well with thee; 

{15:17} Thenthou shalt take an aul, and thrust [it] through his ear unto the door,and he shall be thy servant for ever. And also unto thy maidservantthou shalt do likewise. 

{15:18} It shall not seem hard unto thee, whenthou sendest him away free from thee; for he hath been worth a doublehired servant [to thee,] in serving thee six years: and the LORD thyGod shall bless thee in all that thou doest.   

{15:19} All the firstling males that come of thy herd and of thyflock thou shalt sanctify unto the LORD thy God: thou shalt do no workwith the firstling of thy bullock, nor shear the firstling of thysheep. 

{15:20} Thou shalt eat [it] before the LORD thy God year by yearin the place which the LORD shall choose, thou and thy household.

{15:21} And if there be [any] blemish therein, [as if it be] lame, orblind, [or have] any ill blemish, thou shalt not sacrifice it unto theLORD thy God. 

{15:22} Thou shalt eat it within thy gates: the uncleanand the clean [person shall eat it] alike, as the roebuck, and as thehart. 

{15:23} Only thou shalt not eat the blood thereof; thou shaltpour it upon the ground as water.   

{16:1} Observe the month of Abib, and keep the passover unto theLORD thy God: for in the month of Abib the LORD thy God brought theeforth out of Egypt by night. 

{16:2} Thou shalt therefore sacrifice thepassover unto the LORD thy God, of the flock and the herd, in the placewhich the LORD shall choose to place his name there. 

{16:3} Thou shalteat no leavened bread with it; seven days shalt thou eat unleavenedbread therewith, [even] the bread of affliction; for thou camest forthout of the land of Egypt in haste: that thou mayest remember the daywhen thou camest forth out of the land of Egypt all the days of thylife. 

{16:4} And there shall be no leavened bread seen with thee in allthy coast seven days; neither shall there [any thing] of the flesh,which thou sacrificedst the first day at even, remain all night untilthe morning. 

{16:5} Thou mayest not sacrifice the passover within anyof thy gates, which the LORD thy God giveth thee: 

{16:6} But at theplace which the LORD thy God shall choose to place his name in, therethou shalt sacrifice the passover at even, at the going down of thesun, at the season that thou camest forth out of Egypt. 

{16:7} And thoushalt roast and eat [it] in the place which the LORD thy God shallchoose: and thou shalt turn in the morning, and go unto thy tents.

{16:8} Six days thou shalt eat unleavened bread: and on the seventh day[shall be] a solemn assembly to the LORD thy God: thou shalt do no work[therein.]   

{16:9} Seven weeks shalt thou number unto thee: begin to number theseven weeks from [such time as] thou beginnest [to put] the sickle tothe corn. 

{16:10} And thou shalt keep the feast of weeks unto the LORDthy God with a tribute of a freewill offering of thine hand, which thoushalt give [unto the LORD thy God,] according as the LORD thy God hathblessed thee: 

{16:11} And thou shalt rejoice before the LORD thy God,thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, and thy manservant, and thymaidservant, and the Levite that [is] within thy gates, and thestranger, and the fatherless, and the widow, that [are] among you, inthe place which the LORD thy God hath chosen to place his name there.

{16:12} And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in Egypt: andthou shalt observe and do these statutes.   

{16:13} Thou shalt observe the feast of tabernacles seven days,after that thou hast gathered in thy corn and thy wine: 

{16:14} Andthou shalt rejoice in thy feast, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter,and thy manservant, and thy maidservant, and the Levite, the stranger,and the fatherless, and the widow, that [are] within thy gates. 

{16:15}Seven days shalt thou keep a solemn feast unto the LORD thy God in theplace which the LORD shall choose: because the LORD thy God shall blessthee in all thine increase, and in all the works of thine hands,therefore thou shalt surely rejoice.   

{16:16} Three times in a year shall all thy males appear before theLORD thy God in the place which he shall choose; in the feast ofunleavened bread, and in the feast of weeks, and in the feast oftabernacles: and they shall not appear before the LORD empty: 

{16:17}Every man [shall give] as he is able, according to the blessing of theLORD thy God which he hath given thee.   

{16:18} Judges and officers shalt thou make thee in all thy gates,which the LORD thy God giveth thee, throughout thy tribes: and theyshall judge the people with just judgment. 

{16:19} Thou shalt not wrestjudgment; thou shalt not respect persons, neither take a gift: for agift doth blind the eyes of the wise, and pervert the words of therighteous. 

{16:20} That which is altogether just shalt thou follow,that thou mayest live, and inherit the land which the LORD thy Godgiveth thee.   

{16:21} Thou shalt not plant thee a grove of any trees near unto thealtar of the LORD thy God, which thou shalt make thee. 

{16:22} Neithershalt thou set thee up [any] image; which the LORD thy God hateth.   

{17:1} Thou shalt not sacrifice unto the LORD thy God [any] bullock,or sheep, wherein is blemish, [or] any evilfavouredness: for that [is]an abomination unto the LORD thy God.   

{17:2} If there be found among you, within any of thy gates whichthe LORD thy God giveth thee, man or woman, that hath wroughtwickedness in the sight of the LORD thy God, in transgressing hiscovenant, 

{17:3} And hath gone and served other gods, and worshippedthem, either the sun, or moon, or any of the host of heaven, which Ihave not commanded; 

{17:4} And it be told thee, and thou hast heard [ofit,] and enquired diligently, and, behold, [it be] true, [and] thething certain, [that] such abomination is wrought in Israel: 

{17:5}Then shalt thou bring forth that man or that woman, which havecommitted that wicked thing, unto thy gates, [even] that man or thatwoman, and shalt stone them with stones, till they die. 

{17:6} At themouth of two witnesses, or three witnesses, shall he that is worthy ofdeath be put to death; [but] at the mouth of one witness he shall notbe put to death. 

{17:7} The hands of the witnesses shall be first uponhim to put him to death, and afterward the hands of all the people. Sothou shalt put the evil away from among you.   

{17:8} If there arise a matter too hard for thee in judgment,between blood and blood, between plea and plea, and between stroke andstroke, [being] matters of controversy within thy gates: then shaltthou arise, and get thee up into the place which the LORD thy God shallchoose; 

{17:9} And thou shalt come unto the priests the Levites, andunto the judge that shall be in those days, and enquire; and they shallshew thee the sentence of judgment: 

{17:10} And thou shalt do accordingto the sentence, which they of that place which the LORD shall chooseshall shew thee; and thou shalt observe to do according to all thatthey inform thee: 

{17:11} According to the sentence of the law whichthey shall teach thee, and according to the judgment which they shalltell thee, thou shalt do: thou shalt not decline from the sentencewhich they shall shew thee, [to] the right hand, nor [to] the left.

{17:12} And the man that will do presumptuously, and will not hearkenunto the priest that standeth to minister there before the LORD thyGod, or unto the judge, even that man shall die: and thou shalt putaway the evil from Israel. 

{17:13} And all the people shall hear, andfear, and do no more presumptuously.   

{17:14} When thou art come unto the land which the LORD thy Godgiveth thee, and shalt possess it, and shalt dwell therein, and shaltsay, I will set a king over me, like as all the nations that [are]about me; 

{17:15} Thou shalt in any wise set [him] king over thee, whomthe LORD thy God shall choose: [one] from among thy brethren shalt thouset king over thee: thou mayest not set a stranger over thee, which[is] not thy brother. 

{17:16} But he shall not multiply horses tohimself, nor cause the people to return to Egypt, to the end that heshould multiply horses: forasmuch as the LORD hath said unto you, Yeshall henceforth return no more that way. 

{17:17} Neither shall hemultiply wives to himself, that his heart turn not away: neither shallhe greatly multiply to himself silver and gold. 

{17:18} And it shallbe, when he sitteth upon the throne of his kingdom, that he shall writehim a copy of this law in a book out of [that which is] before thepriests the Levites: 

{17:19} And it shall be with him, and he shallread therein all the days of his life: that he may learn to fear theLORD his God, to keep all the words of this law and these statutes, todo them: 

{17:20} That his heart be not lifted up above his brethren,and that he turn not aside from the commandment, [to] the right hand,or [to] the left: to the end that he may prolong [his] days in hiskingdom, he, and his children, in the midst of Israel.   

{18:1} The priests the Levites, [and] all the tribe of Levi, shallhave no part nor inheritance with Israel: they shall eat the offeringsof the LORD made by fire, and his inheritance. 

{18:2} Therefore shallthey have no inheritance among their brethren: the LORD [is] theirinheritance, as he hath said unto them.   

{18:3} And this shall be the priest's due from the people, from themthat offer a sacrifice, whether [it be] ox or sheep; and they shallgive unto the priest the shoulder, and the two cheeks, and the maw.

{18:4} The firstfruit [also] of thy corn, of thy wine, and of thineoil, and the first of the fleece of thy sheep, shalt thou give him.

{18:5} For the LORD thy God hath chosen him out of all thy tribes, tostand to minister in the name of the LORD, him and his sons for ever.   

{18:6} And if a Levite come from any of thy gates out of all Israel,where he sojourned, and come with all the desire of his mind unto theplace which the LORD shall choose; 

{18:7} Then he shall minister in thename of the LORD his God, as all his brethren the Levites [do,] whichstand there before the LORD. 

{18:8} They shall have like portions toeat, beside that which cometh of the sale of his patrimony.   

{18:9} When thou art come into the land which the LORD thy Godgiveth thee, thou shalt not learn to do after the abominations of thosenations. 

{18:10} There shall not be found among you [any one] thatmaketh his son or his daughter to pass through the fire, or that usethdivination, [or] an observer of times, or an enchanter, or a witch,

{18:11} Or a charmer, or a consulter with familiar spirits, or awizard, or a necromancer. 

{18:12} For all that do these things [are] anabomination unto the LORD: and because of these abominations the LORDthy God doth drive them out from before thee. 

{18:13} Thou shalt beperfect with the LORD thy God. 

{18:14} For these nations, which thoushalt possess, hearkened unto observers of times, and unto diviners:but as for thee, the LORD thy God hath not suffered thee so [to do.]   

{18:15} The LORD thy God will raise up unto thee a Prophet from themidst of thee, of thy brethren, like unto me; unto him ye shallhearken; 

{18:16} According to all that thou desiredst of the LORD thyGod in Horeb in the day of the assembly, saying, Let me not hear againthe voice of the LORD my God, neither let me see this great fire anymore, that I die not. 

{18:17} And the LORD said unto me, They have well[spoken that] which they have spoken. 

{18:18} I will raise them up aProphet from among their brethren, like unto thee, and will put mywords in his mouth; and he shall speak unto them all that I shallcommand him. 

{18:19} And it shall come to pass, [that] whosoever willnot hearken unto my words which he shall speak in my name, I willrequire [it] of him. 

{18:20} But the prophet, which shall presume tospeak a word in my name, which I have not commanded him to speak, orthat shall speak in the name of other gods, even that prophet shalldie. 

{18:21} And if thou say in thine heart, How shall we know the wordwhich the LORD hath not spoken? 

{18:22} When a prophet speaketh in thename of the LORD, if the thing follow not, nor come to pass, that [is]the thing which the LORD hath not spoken, [but] the prophet hath spokenit presumptuously: thou shalt not be afraid of him.   

{19:1} When the LORD thy God hath cut off the nations, whose landthe LORD thy God giveth thee, and thou succeedest them, and dwellest intheir cities, and in their houses; 

{19:2} Thou shalt separate threecities for thee in the midst of thy land, which the LORD thy God giveththee to possess it. 

{19:3} Thou shalt prepare thee a way, and dividethe coasts of thy land, which the LORD thy God giveth thee to inherit,into three parts, that every slayer may flee thither.   

{19:4} And this [is] the case of the slayer, which shall fleethither, that he may live: Whoso killeth his neighbour ignorantly, whomhe hated not in time past; 

{19:5} As when a man goeth into the woodwith his neighbour to hew wood, and his hand fetcheth a stroke with theaxe to cut down the tree, and the head slippeth from the helve, andlighteth upon his neighbour, that he die; he shall flee unto one ofthose cities, and live: 

{19:6} Lest the avenger of the blood pursue theslayer, while his heart is hot, and overtake him, because the way islong, and slay him; whereas he [was] not worthy of death, inasmuch ashe hated him not in time past. 

{19:7} Wherefore I command thee, saying,Thou shalt separate three cities for thee. 

{19:8} And if the LORD thyGod enlarge thy coast, as he hath sworn unto thy fathers, and give theeall the land which he promised to give unto thy fathers; 

{19:9} If thoushalt keep all these commandments to do them, which I command thee thisday, to love the LORD thy God, and to walk ever in his ways; then shaltthou add three cities more for thee, beside these three: 

{19:10} Thatinnocent blood be not shed in thy land, which the LORD thy God giveththee [for] an inheritance, and [so] blood be upon thee.   

{19:11} But if any man hate his neighbour, and lie in wait for him,and rise up against him, and smite him mortally that he die, and fleethinto one of these cities: 

{19:12} Then the elders of his city shallsend and fetch him thence, and deliver him into the hand of the avengerof blood, that he may die. 

{19:13} Thine eye shall not pity him, butthou shalt put away [the guilt of] innocent blood from Israel, that itmay go well with thee.   

{19:14} Thou shalt not remove thy neighbour's landmark, which theyof old time have set in thine inheritance, which thou shalt inherit inthe land that the LORD thy God giveth thee to possess it.   

{19:15} One witness shall not rise up against a man for anyiniquity, or for any sin, in any sin that he sinneth: at the mouth oftwo witnesses, or at the mouth of three witnesses, shall the matter beestablished.   

{19:16} If a false witness rise up against any man to testifyagainst him [that which is] wrong; 

{19:17} Then both the men, betweenwhom the controversy [is,] shall stand before the LORD, before thepriests and the judges, which shall be in those days; 

{19:18} And thejudges shall make diligent inquisition: and, behold, [if] the witness[be] a false witness, [and] hath testified falsely against his brother;

{19:19} Then shall ye do unto him, as he had thought to have done untohis brother: so shalt thou put the evil away from among you. 

{19:20}And those which remain shall hear, and fear, and shall henceforthcommit no more any such evil among you. 

{19:21} And thine eye shall notpity; [but] life [shall go] for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth,hand for hand, foot for foot.   

{20:1} When thou goest out to battle against thine enemies, andseest horses, and chariots, [and] a people more than thou, be notafraid of them: for the LORD thy God [is] with thee, which brought theeup out of the land of Egypt. 

{20:2} And it shall be, when ye are comenigh unto the battle, that the priest shall approach and speak unto thepeople, 

{20:3} And shall say unto them, Hear, O Israel, ye approachthis day unto battle against your enemies: let not your hearts faint,fear not, and do not tremble, neither be ye terrified because of them;

{20:4} For the LORD your God [is] he that goeth with you, to fight foryou against your enemies, to save you.   

{20:5} And the officers shall speak unto the people, saying, Whatman [is there] that hath built a new house, and hath not dedicated it?let him go and return to his house, lest he die in the battle, andanother man dedicate it. 

{20:6} And what man [is he] that hath planteda vineyard, and hath not [yet] eaten of it? let him [also] go andreturn unto his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man eatof it. 

{20:7} And what man [is there] that hath betrothed a wife, andhath not taken her? let him go and return unto his house, lest he diein the battle, and another man take her. 

{20:8} And the officers shallspeak further unto the people, and they shall say, What man [is therethat is] fearful and fainthearted? let him go and return unto hishouse, lest his brethren's heart faint as well as his heart. 

{20:9} Andit shall be, when the officers have made an end of speaking unto thepeople, that they shall make captains of the armies to lead the people.   

{20:10} When thou comest nigh unto a city to fight against it, thenproclaim peace unto it. 

{20:11} And it shall be, if it make thee answerof peace, and open unto thee, then it shall be, [that] all the people[that is] found therein shall be tributaries unto thee, and they shallserve thee. 

{20:12} And if it will make no peace with thee, but willmake war against thee, then thou shalt besiege it: 

{20:13} And when theLORD thy God hath delivered it into thine hands, thou shalt smite everymale thereof with the edge of the sword: 

{20:14} But the women, and thelittle ones, and the cattle, and all that is in the city, [even] allthe spoil thereof, shalt thou take unto thyself; and thou shalt eat thespoil of thine enemies, which the LORD thy God hath given thee. 

{20:15}Thus shalt thou do unto all the cities [which are] very far off fromthee, which [are] not of the cities of these nations. 

{20:16} But ofthe cities of these people, which the LORD thy God doth give thee [for]an inheritance, thou shalt save alive nothing that breatheth: 

{20:17}But thou shalt utterly destroy them; [namely,] the Hittites, and theAmorites, the Canaanites, and the Perizzites, the Hivites, and theJebusites; as the LORD thy God hath commanded thee: 

{20:18} That theyteach you not to do after all their abominations, which they have doneunto their gods; so should ye sin against the LORD your God.   

{20:19} When thou shalt besiege a city a long time, in making waragainst it to take it, thou shalt not destroy the trees thereof byforcing an axe against them: for thou mayest eat of them, and thoushalt not cut them down (for the tree of the field [is] man's [life])to employ [them] in the siege: 

{20:20} Only the trees which thouknowest that they [be] not trees for meat, thou shalt destroy and cutthem down; and thou shalt build bulwarks against the city that makethwar with thee, until it be subdued.   

{21:1} If [one] be found slain in the land which the LORD thy Godgiveth thee to possess it, lying in the field, [and] it be not knownwho hath slain him: 

{21:2} Then thy elders and thy judges shall comeforth, and they shall measure unto the cities which [are] round abouthim that is slain: 

{21:3} And it shall be, [that] the city [which is]next unto the slain man, even the elders of that city shall take anheifer, which hath not been wrought with, [and] which hath not drawn inthe yoke; 

{21:4} And the elders of that city shall bring down theheifer unto a rough valley, which is neither eared nor sown, and shallstrike off the heifer's neck there in the valley: 

{21:5} And thepriests the sons of Levi shall come near; for them the LORD thy Godhath chosen to minister unto him, and to bless in the name of the LORD;and by their word shall every controversy and every stroke be [tried:]

{21:6} And all the elders of that city, [that are] next unto the slain[man,] shall wash their hands over the heifer that is beheaded in thevalley: 

{21:7} And they shall answer and say, Our hands have not shedthis blood, neither have our eyes seen [it. ]

{21:8} Be merciful, OLORD, unto thy people Israel, whom thou hast redeemed, and lay notinnocent blood unto thy people of Israel's charge. And the blood shallbe forgiven them. 

{21:9} So shalt thou put away the [guilt of] innocentblood from among you, when thou shalt do [that which is] right in thesight of the LORD.   

{21:10} When thou goest forth to war against thine enemies, and theLORD thy God hath delivered them into thine hands, and thou hast takenthem captive, 

{21:11} And seest among the captives a beautiful woman,and hast a desire unto her, that thou wouldest have her to thy wife;

{21:12} Then thou shalt bring her home to thine house; and she shallshave her head, and pare her nails; 

{21:13} And she shall put theraiment of her captivity from off her, and shall remain in thine house,and bewail her father and her mother a full month: and after that thoushalt go in unto her, and be her husband, and she shall be thy wife.

{21:14} And it shall be, if thou have no delight in her, then thoushalt let her go whither she will; but thou shalt not sell her at allfor money, thou shalt not make merchandise of her, because thou hasthumbled her.   

{21:15} If a man have two wives, one beloved, and another hated, andthey have born him children, [both] the beloved and the hated; and ifthe firstborn son be hers that was hated: 

{21:16} Then it shall be,when he maketh his sons to inherit [that] which he hath, [that] he maynot make the son of the beloved firstborn before the son of the hated,[which is indeed] the firstborn: 

{21:17} But he shall acknowledge theson of the hated [for] the firstborn, by giving him a double portion ofall that he hath: for he [is] the beginning of his strength; the rightof the firstborn [is] his.   

{21:18} If a man have a stubborn and rebellious son, which will notobey the voice of his father, or the voice of his mother, and [that,]when they have chastened him, will not hearken unto them: 

{21:19} Thenshall his father and his mother lay hold on him, and bring him out untothe elders of his city, and unto the gate of his place; 

{21:20} Andthey shall say unto the elders of his city, This our son [is] stubbornand rebellious, he will not obey our voice; [he is] a glutton, and adrunkard. 

{21:21} And all the men of his city shall stone him withstones, that he die: so shalt thou put evil away from among you; andall Israel shall hear, and fear.   

{21:22} And if a man have committed a sin worthy of death, and he beto be put to death, and thou hang him on a tree: 

{21:23} His body shallnot remain all night upon the tree, but thou shalt in any wise bury himthat day; (for he that is hanged [is] accursed of God;) that thy landbe not defiled, which the LORD thy God giveth thee [for] an inheritance.   

{22:1} Thou shalt not see the brother's ox or his sheep go astray,and hide thyself from them: thou shalt in any case bring them againunto thy brother. 

{22:2} And if thy brother [be] not nigh unto thee, orif thou know him not, then thou shalt bring it unto thine own house,and it shall be with thee until thy brother seek after it, and thoushalt restore it to him again. 

{22:3} In like manner shalt thou do withhis ass; and so shalt thou do with his raiment; and with all lostthings of thy brother's, which he hath lost, and thou hast found, shaltthou do likewise: thou mayest not hide thyself.   

{22:4} Thou shalt not see thy brother's ass or his ox fall down bythe way, and hide thyself from them: thou shalt surely help him to lift[them] up again.   

{22:5} The woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man,neither shall a man put on a woman's garment: for all that do so [are]abomination unto the LORD thy God.   

{22:6} If a bird's nest chance to be before thee in the way in anytree, or on the ground, [whether they be] young ones, or eggs, and thedam sitting upon the young, or upon the eggs, thou shalt not take thedam with the young: 

{22:7} [But] thou shalt in any wise let the dam go,and take the young to thee; that it may be well with thee, and [that]thou mayest prolong [thy] days.   

{22:8} When thou buildest a new house, then thou shalt make abattlement for thy roof, that thou bring not blood upon thine house, ifany man fall from thence.   

{22:9} Thou shalt not sow thy vineyard with divers seeds: lest thefruit of thy seed which thou hast sown, and the fruit of thy vineyard,be defiled.   

{22:10} Thou shalt not plow with an ox and an ass together.   

{22:11} Thou shalt not wear a garment of divers sorts, [as] ofwoollen and linen together.   

{22:12} Thou shalt make thee fringes upon the four quarters of thyvesture, wherewith thou coverest [thyself.]   

{22:13} If any man take a wife, and go in unto her, and hate her,

{22:14} And give occasions of speech against her, and bring up an evilname upon her, and say, I took this woman, and when I came to her, Ifound her not a maid: 

{22:15} Then shall the father of the damsel, andher mother, take and bring forth [the tokens of] the damsel's virginityunto the elders of the city in the gate: 

{22:16} And the damsel'sfather shall say unto the elders, I gave my daughter unto this man towife, and he hateth her; 

{22:17} And, lo, he hath given occasions ofspeech [against her,] saying, I found not thy daughter a maid; and yetthese [are the tokens of] my daughter's virginity. And they shallspread the cloth before the elders of the city. 

{22:18} And the eldersof that city shall take that man and chastise him; 

{22:19} And theyshall amerce him in an hundred [shekels] of silver, and give [them]unto the father of the damsel, because he hath brought up an evil nameupon a virgin of Israel: and she shall be his wife; he may not put heraway all his days. 

{22:20} But if this thing be true, [and the tokensof] virginity be not found for the damsel: 

{22:21} Then they shallbring out the damsel to the door of her father's house, and the men ofher city shall stone her with stones that she die: because she hathwrought folly in Israel, to play the whore in her father's house: soshalt thou put evil away from among you.   

{22:22} If a man be found lying with a woman married to an husband,then they shall both of them die, [both] the man that lay with thewoman, and the woman: so shalt thou put away evil from Israel.   

{22:23} If a damsel [that is] a virgin be betrothed unto an husband,and a man find her in the city, and lie with her; 

{22:24} Then ye shallbring them both out unto the gate of that city, and ye shall stone themwith stones that they die; the damsel, because she cried not, [being]in the city; and the man, because he hath humbled his neighbour's wife:so thou shalt put away evil from among you.   

{22:25} But if a man find a betrothed damsel in the field, and theman force her, and lie with her: then the man only that lay with hershall die: 

{22:26} But unto the damsel thou shalt do nothing; [thereis] in the damsel no sin [worthy] of death: for as when a man risethagainst his neighbour, and slayeth him, even so [is] this matter:

{22:27} For he found her in the field, [and] the betrothed damselcried, and [there was] none to save her.   

{22:28} If a man find a damsel [that is] a virgin, which is notbetrothed, and lay hold on her, and lie with her, and they be found;

{22:29} Then the man that lay with her shall give unto the damsel'sfather fifty [shekels] of silver, and she shall be his wife; because hehath humbled her, he may not put her away all his days.   

{22:30} A man shall not take his father's wife, nor discover hisfather's skirt.   

{23:1} He that is wounded in the stones, or hath his privy membercut off, shall not enter into the congregation of the LORD. 

{23:2} Abastard shall not enter into the congregation of the LORD; even to histenth generation shall he not enter into the congregation of the LORD.

{23:3} An Ammonite or Moabite shall not enter into the congregation ofthe LORD; even to their tenth generation shall they not enter into thecongregation of the LORD for ever: 

{23:4} Because they met you not withbread and with water in the way, when ye came forth out of Egypt; andbecause they hired against thee Balaam the son of Beor of Pethor ofMesopotamia, to curse thee. 

{23:5} Nevertheless the LORD thy God wouldnot hearken unto Balaam; but the LORD thy God turned the curse into ablessing unto thee, because the LORD thy God loved thee. 

{23:6} Thoushalt not seek their peace nor their prosperity all thy days for ever.   

{23:7} Thou shalt not abhor an Edomite; for he [is] thy brother:thou shalt not abhor an Egyptian; because thou wast a stranger in hisland. 

{23:8} The children that are begotten of them shall enter intothe congregation of the LORD in their third generation.   

{23:9} When the host goeth forth against thine enemies, then keepthee from every wicked thing.   

{23:10} If there be among you any man, that is not clean by reasonof uncleanness that chanceth him by night, then shall he go abroad outof the camp, he shall not come within the camp: 

{23:11} But it shallbe, when evening cometh on, he shall wash [himself] with water: andwhen the sun is down, he shall come into the camp [again.]   

{23:12} Thou shalt have a place also without the camp, whither thoushalt go forth abroad: 

{23:13} And thou shalt have a paddle upon thyweapon; and it shall be, when thou wilt ease thyself abroad, thou shaltdig therewith, and shalt turn back and cover that which cometh fromthee: 

{23:14} For the LORD thy God walketh in the midst of thy camp, todeliver thee, and to give up thine enemies before thee; therefore shallthy camp be holy: that he see no unclean thing in thee, and turn awayfrom thee.   

{23:15} Thou shalt not deliver unto his master the servant which isescaped from his master unto thee: 

{23:16} He shall dwell with thee,[even] among you, in that place which he shall choose in one of thygates, where it liketh him best: thou shalt not oppress him.   

{23:17} There shall be no whore of the daughters of Israel, nor asodomite of the sons of Israel. 

{23:18} Thou shalt not bring the hireof a whore, or the price of a dog, into the house of the LORD thy Godfor any vow: for even both these [are] abomination unto the LORD thyGod.   

{23:19} Thou shalt not lend upon usury to thy brother; usury ofmoney, usury of victuals, usury of any thing that is lent upon usury:

{23:20} Unto a stranger thou mayest lend upon usury; but unto thybrother thou shalt not lend upon usury: that the LORD thy God may blessthee in all that thou settest thine hand to in the land whither thougoest to possess it.   

{23:21} When thou shalt vow a vow unto the LORD thy God, thou shaltnot slack to pay it: for the LORD thy God will surely require it ofthee; and it would be sin in thee. 

{23:22} But if thou shalt forbear tovow, it shall be no sin in thee. 

{23:23} That which is gone out of thylips thou shalt keep and perform; [even] a freewill offering, accordingas thou hast vowed unto the LORD thy God, which thou hast promised withthy mouth.   

{23:24} When thou comest into thy neighbour's vineyard, then thoumayest eat grapes thy fill at thine own pleasure; but thou shalt notput [any] in thy vessel. 

{23:25} When thou comest into the standingcorn of thy neighbour, then thou mayest pluck the ears with thine hand;but thou shalt not move a sickle unto thy neighbour's standing corn.   

{24:1} When a man hath taken a wife, and married her, and it come topass that she find no favour in his eyes, because he hath found someuncleanness in her: then let him write her a bill of divorcement, andgive [it] in her hand, and send her out of his house. 

{24:2} And whenshe is departed out of his house, she may go and be another man's[wife. ]

{24:3} And [if] the latter husband hate her, and write her abill of divorcement, and giveth [it] in her hand, and sendeth her outof his house; or if the latter husband die, which took her to [be] hiswife; 

{24:4} Her former husband, which sent her away, may not take heragain to be his wife, after that she is defiled; for that [is]abomination before the LORD: and thou shalt not cause the land to sin,which the LORD thy God giveth thee [for] an inheritance.   

{24:5} When a man hath taken a new wife, he shall not go out to war,neither shall he be charged with any business: [but] he shall be freeat home one year, and shall cheer up his wife which he hath taken.   

{24:6} No man shall take the nether or the upper millstone topledge: for he taketh [a man's] life to pledge.   

{24:7} If a man be found stealing any of his brethren of thechildren of Israel, and maketh merchandise of him, or selleth him; thenthat thief shall die; and thou shalt put evil away from among you.   

{24:8} Take heed in the plague of leprosy, that thou observediligently, and do according to all that the priests the Levites shallteach you: as I commanded them, so ye shall observe to do. 

{24:9}Remember what the LORD thy God did unto Miriam by the way, after thatye were come forth out of Egypt.   

{24:10} When thou dost lend thy brother any thing, thou shalt not gointo his house to fetch his pledge. 

{24:11} Thou shalt stand abroad,and the man to whom thou dost lend shall bring out the pledge abroadunto thee. 

{24:12} And if the man [be] poor, thou shalt not sleep withhis pledge: 

{24:13} In any case thou shalt deliver him the pledge againwhen the sun goeth down, that he may sleep in his own raiment, andbless thee: and it shall be righteousness unto thee before the LORD thyGod.   

{24:14} Thou shalt not oppress an hired servant [that is] poor andneedy, [whether he be] of thy brethren, or of thy strangers that [are]in thy land within thy gates: 

{24:15} At his day thou shalt give [him]his hire, neither shall the sun go down upon it; for he [is] poor, andsetteth his heart upon it: lest he cry against thee unto the LORD, andit be sin unto thee. 

{24:16} The fathers shall not be put to death forthe children, neither shall the children be put to death for thefathers: every man shall be put to death for his own sin.   

{24:17} Thou shalt not pervert the judgment of the stranger, [nor]of the fatherless; nor take a widow's raiment to pledge: 

{24:18} Butthou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in Egypt, and the LORD thyGod redeemed thee thence: therefore I command thee to do this thing.   

{24:19} When thou cuttest down thine harvest in thy field, and hastforgot a sheaf in the field, thou shalt not go again to fetch it: itshall be for the stranger, for the fatherless, and for the widow: thatthe LORD thy God may bless thee in all the work of thine hands. 

{24:20}When thou beatest thine olive tree, thou shalt not go over the boughsagain: it shall be for the stranger, for the fatherless, and for thewidow. 

{24:21} When thou gatherest the grapes of thy vineyard, thoushalt not glean [it] afterward: it shall be for the stranger, for thefatherless, and for the widow. 

{24:22} And thou shalt remember thatthou wast a bondman in the land of Egypt: therefore I command thee todo this thing.   

{25:1} If there be a controversy between men, and they come untojudgment, that [the judges] may judge them; then they shall justify therighteous, and condemn the wicked. 

{25:2} And it shall be, if thewicked man [be] worthy to be beaten, that the judge shall cause him tolie down, and to be beaten before his face, according to his fault, bya certain number. 

{25:3} Forty stripes he may give him, [and] notexceed: lest, [if] he should exceed, and beat him above these with manystripes, then thy brother should seem vile unto thee.   

{25:4} Thou shalt not muzzle the ox when he treadeth out [the corn.]   

{25:5} If brethren dwell together, and one of them die, and have nochild, the wife of the dead shall not marry without unto a stranger:her husband's brother shall go in unto her, and take her to him towife, and perform the duty of an husband's brother unto her. 

{25:6} Andit shall be, [that] the firstborn which she beareth shall succeed inthe name of his brother [which is] dead, that his name be not put outof Israel. 

{25:7} And if the man like not to take his brother's wife,then let his brother's wife go up to the gate unto the elders, and say,My husband's brother refuseth to raise up unto his brother a name inIsrael, he will not perform the duty of my husband's brother. 

{25:8}Then the elders of his city shall call him, and speak unto him: and[if] he stand [to it,] and say, I like not to take her; 

{25:9} Thenshall his brother's wife come unto him in the presence of the elders,and loose his shoe from off his foot, and spit in his face, and shallanswer and say, So shall it be done unto that man that will not buildup his brother's house. 

{25:10} And his name shall be called in Israel,The house of him that hath his shoe loosed.   

{25:11} When men strive together one with another, and the wife ofthe one draweth near for to deliver her husband out of the hand of himthat smiteth him, and putteth forth her hand, and taketh him by thesecrets: 

{25:12} Then thou shalt cut off her hand, thine eye shall notpity [her.]   

{25:13} Thou shalt not have in thy bag divers weights, a great and asmall. 

{25:14} Thou shalt not have in thine house divers measures, agreat and a small. 

{25:15} [But] thou shalt have a perfect and justweight, a perfect and just measure shalt thou have: that thy days maybe lengthened in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee. 

{25:16}For all that do such things, [and] all that do unrighteously, [are] anabomination unto the LORD thy God.   

{25:17} Remember what Amalek did unto thee by the way, when ye werecome forth out of Egypt; 

{25:18} How he met thee by the way, and smotethe hindmost of thee, [even] all [that were] feeble behind thee, whenthou [wast] faint and weary; and he feared not God. 

{25:19} Thereforeit shall be, when the LORD thy God hath given thee rest from all thineenemies round about, in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee[for] an inheritance to possess it, [that] thou shalt blot out theremembrance of Amalek from under heaven; thou shalt not forget [it.]   

{26:1} And it shall be, when thou [art] come in unto the land whichthe LORD thy God giveth thee [for] an inheritance, and possessest it,and dwellest therein; 

{26:2} That thou shalt take of the first of allthe fruit of the earth, which thou shalt bring of thy land that theLORD thy God giveth thee, and shalt put [it] in a basket, and shalt gounto the place which the LORD thy God shall choose to place his namethere. 

{26:3} And thou shalt go unto the priest that shall be in thosedays, and say unto him, I profess this day unto the LORD thy God, thatI am come unto the country which the LORD sware unto our fathers for togive us. 

{26:4} And the priest shall take the basket out of thine hand,and set it down before the altar of the LORD thy God. 

{26:5} And thoushalt speak and say before the LORD thy God, A Syrian ready to perish[was] my father, and he went down into Egypt, and sojourned there witha few, and became there a nation, great, mighty, and populous: 

{26:6}And the Egyptians evil entreated us, and afflicted us, and laid upon ushard bondage: 

{26:7} And when we cried unto the LORD God of ourfathers, the LORD heard our voice, and looked on our affliction, andour labour, and our oppression: 

{26:8} And the LORD brought us forthout of Egypt with a mighty hand, and with an outstretched arm, and withgreat terribleness, and with signs, and with wonders: 

{26:9} And hehath brought us into this place, and hath given us this land, [even] aland that floweth with milk and honey. 

{26:10} And now, behold, I havebrought the firstfruits of the land, which thou, O LORD, hast given me.And thou shalt set it before the LORD thy God, and worship before theLORD thy God: 

{26:11} And thou shalt rejoice in every good [thing]which the LORD thy God hath given unto thee, and unto thine house,thou, and the Levite, and the stranger that [is] among you.   

{26:12} When thou hast made an end of tithing all the tithes ofthine increase the third year, [which is] the year of tithing, and hastgiven [it] unto the Levite, the stranger, the fatherless, and thewidow, that they may eat within thy gates, and be filled; 

{26:13} Thenthou shalt say before the LORD thy God, I have brought away thehallowed things out of [mine] house, and also have given them unto theLevite, and unto the stranger, to the fatherless, and to the widow,according to all thy commandments which thou hast commanded me: I havenot transgressed thy commandments, neither have I forgotten [them:]

{26:14} I have not eaten thereof in my mourning, neither have I takenaway [ought] thereof for [any] unclean [use,] nor given [ought] thereoffor the dead: [but] I have hearkened to the voice of the LORD my God,[and] have done according to all that thou hast commanded me. 

{26:15}Look down from thy holy habitation, from heaven, and bless thy peopleIsrael, and the land which thou hast given us, as thou swarest unto ourfathers, a land that floweth with milk and honey.   

{26:16} This day the LORD thy God hath commanded thee to do thesestatutes and judgments: thou shalt therefore keep and do them with allthine heart, and with all thy soul. 

{26:17} Thou hast avouched the LORDthis day to be thy God, and to walk in his ways, and to keep hisstatutes, and his commandments, and his judgments, and to hearken untohis voice: 

{26:18} And the LORD hath avouched thee this day to be hispeculiar people, as he hath promised thee, and that [thou] shouldestkeep all his commandments; 

{26:19} And to make thee high above allnations which he hath made, in praise, and in name, and in honour; andthat thou mayest be an holy people unto the LORD thy God, as he hathspoken.   

{27:1} And Moses with the elders of Israel commanded the people,saying, Keep all the commandments which I command you this day. 

{27:2}And it shall be on the day when ye shall pass over Jordan unto the landwhich the LORD thy God giveth thee, that thou shalt set thee up greatstones, and plaister them with plaister: 

{27:3} And thou shalt writeupon them all the words of this law, when thou art passed over, thatthou mayest go in unto the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee, aland that floweth with milk and honey; as the LORD God of thy fathershath promised thee. 

{27:4} Therefore it shall be when ye be gone overJordan, [that] ye shall set up these stones, which I command you thisday, in mount Ebal, and thou shalt plaister them with plaister. 

{27:5}And there shalt thou build an altar unto the LORD thy God, an altar ofstones: thou shalt not lift up [any] iron [tool] upon them. 

{27:6} Thoushalt build the altar of the LORD thy God of whole stones: and thoushalt offer burnt offerings thereon unto the LORD thy God: 

{27:7} Andthou shalt offer peace offerings, and shalt eat there, and rejoicebefore the LORD thy God. 

{27:8} And thou shalt write upon the stonesall the words of this law very plainly.   

{27:9} And Moses and the priests the Levites spake unto all Israel,saying, Take heed, and hearken, O Israel; this day thou art become thepeople of the LORD thy God. 

{27:10} Thou shalt therefore obey the voiceof the LORD thy God, and do his commandments and his statutes, which Icommand thee this day.   

{27:11} And Moses charged the people the same day, saying, 

{27:12}These shall stand upon mount Gerizim to bless the people, when ye arecome over Jordan; Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, andJoseph, and Benjamin: 

{27:13} And these shall stand upon mount Ebal tocurse; Reuben, Gad, and Asher, and Zebulun, Dan, and Naphtali.   

{27:14} And the Levites shall speak, and say unto all the men ofIsrael with a loud voice, 

{27:15} Cursed [be] the man that maketh [any]graven or molten image, an abomination unto the LORD, the work of thehands of the craftsman, and putteth [it] in [a] secret [place.] And allthe people shall answer and say, Amen. 

{27:16} Cursed [be] he thatsetteth light by his father or his mother. And all the people shallsay, Amen. 

{27:17} Cursed [be] he that removeth his neighbour'slandmark. And all the people shall say, Amen. 

{27:18} Cursed [be] hethat maketh the blind to wander out of the way. And all the peopleshall say, Amen. 

{27:19} Cursed [be] he that perverteth the judgment ofthe stranger, fatherless, and widow. And all the people shall say,Amen. 

{27:20} Cursed [be] he that lieth with his father's wife; becausehe uncovereth his father's skirt. And all the people shall say, Amen.

{27:21} Cursed [be] he that lieth with any manner of beast. And all thepeople shall say, Amen. 

{27:22} Cursed [be] he that lieth with hissister, the daughter of his father, or the daughter of his mother. Andall the people shall say, Amen. 

{27:23} Cursed [be] he that lieth withhis mother in law. And all the people shall say, Amen. 

{27:24} Cursed[be] he that smiteth his neighbour secretly. And all the people shallsay, Amen. 

{27:25} Cursed [be] he that taketh reward to slay aninnocent person. And all the people shall say, Amen. 

{27:26} Cursed[be] he that confirmeth not [all] the words of this law to do them. Andall the people shall say, Amen.   

{28:1} And it shall come to pass, if thou shalt hearken diligentlyunto the voice of the LORD thy God, to observe [and] to do all hiscommandments which I command thee this day, that the LORD thy God willset thee on high above all nations of the earth: 

{28:2} And all theseblessings shall come on thee, and overtake thee, if thou shalt hearkenunto the voice of the LORD thy God. 

{28:3} Blessed [shalt] thou [be] inthe city, and blessed [shalt] thou [be] in the field. 

{28:4} Blessed[shall be] the fruit of thy body, and the fruit of thy ground, and thefruit of thy cattle, the increase of thy kine, and the flocks of thysheep. 

{28:5} Blessed [shall be] thy basket and thy store. 

{28:6}Blessed [shalt] thou [be] when thou comest in, and blessed [shalt] thou[be] when thou goest out. 

{28:7} The LORD shall cause thine enemiesthat rise up against thee to be smitten before thy face: they shallcome out against thee one way, and flee before thee seven ways. 

{28:8}The LORD shall command the blessing upon thee in thy storehouses, andin all that thou settest thine hand unto; and he shall bless thee inthe land which the LORD thy God giveth thee. 

{28:9} The LORD shallestablish thee an holy people unto himself, as he hath sworn unto thee,if thou shalt keep the commandments of the LORD thy God, and walk inhis ways. 

{28:10} And all people of the earth shall see that thou artcalled by the name of the LORD; and they shall be afraid of thee.

{28:11} And the LORD shall make thee plenteous in goods, in the fruitof thy body, and in the fruit of thy cattle, and in the fruit of thyground, in the land which the LORD sware unto thy fathers to give thee.

{28:12} The LORD shall open unto thee his good treasure, the heaven togive the rain unto thy land in his season, and to bless all the work ofthine hand: and thou shalt lend unto many nations, and thou shalt notborrow. 

{28:13} And the LORD shall make thee the head, and not thetail; and thou shalt be above only, and thou shalt not be beneath; ifthat thou hearken unto the commandments of the LORD thy God, which Icommand thee this day, to observe and to do [them: ]

{28:14} And thoushalt not go aside from any of the words which I command thee this day,to the right hand, or [to] the left, to go after other gods to servethem.   

{28:15} But it shall come to pass, if thou wilt not hearken unto thevoice of the LORD thy God, to observe to do all his commandments andhis statutes which I command thee this day; that all these curses shallcome upon thee, and overtake thee: 

{28:16} Cursed [shalt] thou [be] inthe city, and cursed [shalt] thou [be] in the field. 

{28:17} Cursed[shall be] thy basket and thy store. 

{28:18} Cursed [shall be] thefruit of thy body, and the fruit of thy land, the increase of thy kine,and the flocks of thy sheep. 

{28:19} Cursed [shalt] thou [be] when thoucomest in, and cursed [shalt] thou [be] when thou goest out. 

{28:20}The LORD shall send upon thee cursing, vexation, and rebuke, in allthat thou settest thine hand unto for to do, until thou be destroyed,and until thou perish quickly; because of the wickedness of thy doings,whereby thou hast forsaken me. 

{28:21} The LORD shall make thepestilence cleave unto thee, until he have consumed thee from off theland, whither thou goest to possess it. 

{28:22} The LORD shall smitethee with a consumption, and with a fever, and with an inflammation,and with an extreme burning, and with the sword, and with blasting, andwith mildew; and they shall pursue thee until thou perish. 

{28:23} Andthy heaven that [is] over thy head shall be brass, and the earth thatis under thee [shall be] iron. 

{28:24} The LORD shall make the rain ofthy land powder and dust: from heaven shall it come down upon thee,until thou be destroyed. 

{28:25} The LORD shall cause thee to besmitten before thine enemies: thou shalt go out one way against them,and flee seven ways before them: and shalt be removed into all thekingdoms of the earth. 

{28:26} And thy carcase shall be meat unto allfowls of the air, and unto the beasts of the earth, and no man shallfray [them] away. 

{28:27} The LORD will smite thee with the botch ofEgypt, and with the emerods, and with the scab, and with the itch,whereof thou canst not be healed. 

{28:28} The LORD shall smite theewith madness, and blindness, and astonishment of heart: 

{28:29} Andthou shalt grope at noonday, as the blind gropeth in darkness, and thoushalt not prosper in thy ways: and thou shalt be only oppressed andspoiled evermore, and no man shall save [thee. ]

{28:30} Thou shaltbetroth a wife, and another man shall lie with her: thou shalt build anhouse, and thou shalt not dwell therein: thou shalt plant a vineyard,and shalt not gather the grapes thereof. 

{28:31} Thine ox [shall be]slain before thine eyes, and thou shalt not eat thereof: thine ass[shall be] violently taken away from before thy face, and shall not berestored to thee: thy sheep [shall be] given unto thine enemies, andthou shalt have none to rescue [them. ]

{28:32} Thy sons and thydaughters [shall be] given unto another people, and thine eyes shalllook, and fail [with longing] for them all the day long: and [thereshall be] no might in thine hand. 

{28:33} The fruit of thy land, andall thy labours, shall a nation which thou knowest not eat up; and thoushalt be only oppressed and crushed alway: 

{28:34} So that thou shaltbe mad for the sight of thine eyes which thou shalt see. 

{28:35} TheLORD shall smite thee in the knees, and in the legs, with a sore botchthat cannot be healed, from the sole of thy foot unto the top of thyhead. 

{28:36} The LORD shall bring thee, and thy king which thou shaltset over thee, unto a nation which neither thou nor thy fathers haveknown; and there shalt thou serve other gods, wood and stone. 

{28:37}And thou shalt become an astonishment, a proverb, and a byword, amongall nations whither the LORD shall lead thee. 

{28:38} Thou shalt carrymuch seed out into the field, and shalt gather [but] little in; for thelocust shall consume it. 

{28:39} Thou shalt plant vineyards, and dress[them,] but shalt neither drink [of] the wine, nor gather [the grapes;]for the worms shall eat them. 

{28:40} Thou shalt have olive treesthroughout all thy coasts, but thou shalt not anoint [thyself] with theoil; for thine olive shall cast [his fruit. ]

{28:41} Thou shalt begetsons and daughters, but thou shalt not enjoy them; for they shall gointo captivity. 

{28:42} All thy trees and fruit of thy land shall thelocust consume. 

{28:43} The stranger that [is] within thee shall get upabove thee very high; and thou shalt come down very low. 

{28:44} Heshall lend to thee, and thou shalt not lend to him: he shall be thehead, and thou shalt be the tail. 

{28:45} Moreover all these cursesshall come upon thee, and shall pursue thee, and overtake thee, tillthou be destroyed; because thou hearkenedst not unto the voice of theLORD thy God, to keep his commandments and his statutes which hecommanded thee: 

{28:46} And they shall be upon thee for a sign and fora wonder, and upon thy seed for ever. 

{28:47} Because thou servedst notthe LORD thy God with joyfulness, and with gladness of heart, for theabundance of all [things; ]

{28:48} Therefore shalt thou serve thineenemies which the LORD shall send against thee, in hunger, and inthirst, and in nakedness, and in want of all [things:] and he shall puta yoke of iron upon thy neck, until he have destroyed thee. 

{28:49} TheLORD shall bring a nation against thee from far, from the end of theearth, [as swift] as the eagle flieth; a nation whose tongue thou shaltnot understand; 

{28:50} A nation of fierce countenance, which shall notregard the person of the old, nor shew favour to the young: 

{28:51} Andhe shall eat the fruit of thy cattle, and the fruit of thy land, untilthou be destroyed: which [also] shall not leave thee [either] corn,wine, or oil, [or] the increase of thy kine, or flocks of thy sheep,until he have destroyed thee. 

{28:52} And he shall besiege thee in allthy gates, until thy high and fenced walls come down, wherein thoutrustedst, throughout all thy land: and he shall besiege thee in allthy gates throughout all thy land, which the LORD thy God hath giventhee. 

{28:53} And thou shalt eat the fruit of thine own body, the fleshof thy sons and of thy daughters, which the LORD thy God hath giventhee, in the siege, and in the straitness, wherewith thine enemiesshall distress thee: 

{28:54} [So that] the man [that is] tender amongyou, and very delicate, his eye shall be evil toward his brother, andtoward the wife of his bosom, and toward the remnant of his childrenwhich he shall leave: 

{28:55} So that he will not give to any of themof the flesh of his children whom he shall eat: because he hath nothingleft him in the siege, and in the straitness, wherewith thine enemiesshall distress thee in all thy gates. 

{28:56} The tender and delicatewoman among you, which would not adventure to set the sole of her footupon the ground for delicateness and tenderness, her eye shall be eviltoward the husband of her bosom, and toward her son, and toward herdaughter, 

{28:57} And toward her young one that cometh out from betweenher feet, and toward her children which she shall bear: for she shalleat them for want of all [things] secretly in the siege and straitness,wherewith thine enemy shall distress thee in thy gates. 

{28:58} If thouwilt not observe to do all the words of this law that are written inthis book, that thou mayest fear this glorious and fearful name, THELORD THY GOD; 

{28:59} Then the LORD will make thy plagues wonderful,and the plagues of thy seed, [even] great plagues, and of longcontinuance, and sore sicknesses, and of long continuance. 

{28:60}Moreover he will bring upon thee all the diseases of Egypt, which thouwast afraid of; and they shall cleave unto thee. 

{28:61} Also everysickness, and every plague, which [is] not written in the book of thislaw, them will the LORD bring upon thee, until thou be destroyed.

{28:62} And ye shall be left few in number, whereas ye were as thestars of heaven for multitude; because thou wouldest not obey the voiceof the LORD thy God. 

{28:63} And it shall come to pass, [that] as theLORD rejoiced over you to do you good, and to multiply you; so the LORDwill rejoice over you to destroy you, and to bring you to nought; andye shall be plucked from off the land whither thou goest to possess it.

{28:64} And the LORD shall scatter thee among all people, from the oneend of the earth even unto the other; and there thou shalt serve othergods, which neither thou nor thy fathers have known, [even] wood andstone. 

{28:65} And among these nations shalt thou find no ease, neithershall the sole of thy foot have rest: but the LORD shall give theethere a trembling heart, and failing of eyes, and sorrow of mind:

{28:66} And thy life shall hang in doubt before thee; and thou shaltfear day and night, and shalt have none assurance of thy life: 

{28:67}In the morning thou shalt say, Would God it were even! and at even thoushalt say, Would God it were morning! for the fear of thine heartwherewith thou shalt fear, and for the sight of thine eyes which thoushalt see. 

{28:68} And the LORD shall bring thee into Egypt again withships, by the way whereof I spake unto thee, Thou shalt see it no moreagain: and there ye shall be sold unto your enemies for bondmen andbondwomen, and no man shall buy [you.]   

{29:1} These [are] the words of the covenant, which the LORDcommanded Moses to make with the children of Israel in the land ofMoab, beside the covenant which he made with them in Horeb.   

{29:2} And Moses called unto all Israel, and said unto them, Ye haveseen all that the LORD did before your eyes in the land of Egypt untoPharaoh, and unto all his servants, and unto all his land; 

{29:3} Thegreat temptations which thine eyes have seen, the signs, and thosegreat miracles: 

{29:4} Yet the LORD hath not given you an heart toperceive, and eyes to see, and ears to hear, unto this day. 

{29:5} AndI have led you forty years in the wilderness: your clothes are notwaxen old upon you, and thy shoe is not waxen old upon thy foot. 

{29:6}Ye have not eaten bread, neither have ye drunk wine or strong drink:that ye might know that I [am] the LORD your God. 

{29:7} And when yecame unto this place, Sihon the king of Heshbon, and Og the king ofBashan, came out against us unto battle, and we smote them: 

{29:8} Andwe took their land, and gave it for an inheritance unto the Reubenites,and to the Gadites, and to the half tribe of Manasseh. 

{29:9} Keeptherefore the words of this covenant, and do them, that ye may prosperin all that ye do.   

{29:10} Ye stand this day all of you before the LORD your God; yourcaptains of your tribes, your elders, and your officers, [with] all themen of Israel, 

{29:11} Your little ones, your wives, and thy strangerthat [is] in thy camp, from the hewer of thy wood unto the drawer ofthy water: 

{29:12} That thou shouldest enter into covenant with theLORD thy God, and into his oath, which the LORD thy God maketh withthee this day: 

{29:13} That he may establish thee to day for a peopleunto himself, and [that] he may be unto thee a God, as he hath saidunto thee, and as he hath sworn unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac,and to Jacob. 

{29:14} Neither with you only do I make this covenant andthis oath; 

{29:15} But with [him] that standeth here with us this daybefore the LORD our God, and also with [him] that [is] not here with usthis day: 

{29:16} (For ye know how we have dwelt in the land of Egypt;and how we came through the nations which ye passed by; 

{29:17} And yehave seen their abominations, and their idols, wood and stone, silverand gold, which [were] among them:) 

{29:18} Lest there should be amongyou man, or woman, or family, or tribe, whose heart turneth away thisday from the LORD our God, to go [and] serve the gods of these nations;lest there should be among you a root that beareth gall and wormwood;

{29:19} And it come to pass, when he heareth the words of this curse,that he bless himself in his heart, saying, I shall have peace, thoughI walk in the imagination of mine heart, to add drunkenness to thirst:

{29:20} The LORD will not spare him, but then the anger of the LORD andhis jealousy shall smoke against that man, and all the curses that arewritten in this book shall lie upon him, and the LORD shall blot outhis name from under heaven. 

{29:21} And the LORD shall separate himunto evil out of all the tribes of Israel, according to all the cursesof the covenant that are written in this book of the law: 

{29:22} Sothat the generation to come of your children that shall rise up afteryou, and the stranger that shall come from a far land, shall say, whenthey see the plagues of that land, and the sicknesses which the LORDhath laid upon it; 

{29:23} [And that] the whole land thereof [is]brimstone, and salt, [and] burning, [that] it is not sown, nor beareth,nor any grass groweth therein, like the overthrow of Sodom, andGomorrah, Admah, and Zeboim, which the LORD overthrew in his anger, andin his wrath: 

{29:24} Even all nations shall say, Wherefore hath theLORD done thus unto this land? what [meaneth] the heat of this greatanger? 

{29:25} Then men shall say, Because they have forsaken thecovenant of the LORD God of their fathers, which he made with them whenhe brought them forth out of the land of Egypt: 

{29:26} For they wentand served other gods, and worshipped them, gods whom they knew not,and [whom] he had not given unto them: 

{29:27} And the anger of theLORD was kindled against this land, to bring upon it all the cursesthat are written in this book: 

{29:28} And the LORD rooted them out oftheir land in anger, and in wrath, and in great indignation, and castthem into another land, as [it is] this day. 

{29:29} The secret [thingsbelong] unto the LORD our God: but [those things which] are revealed[belong] unto us and to our children for ever, that [we] may do all thewords of this law.   

{30:1} And it shall come to pass, when all these things are comeupon thee, the blessing and the curse, which I have set before thee,and thou shalt call [them] to mind among all the nations, whither theLORD thy God hath driven thee, 

{30:2} And shalt return unto the LORDthy God, and shalt obey his voice according to all that I command theethis day, thou and thy children, with all thine heart, and with all thysoul; 

{30:3} That then the LORD thy God will turn thy captivity, andhave compassion upon thee, and will return and gather thee from all thenations, whither the LORD thy God hath scattered thee. 

{30:4} If [any]of thine be driven out unto the outmost [parts] of heaven, from thencewill the LORD thy God gather thee, and from thence will he fetch thee:

{30:5} And the LORD thy God will bring thee into the land which thyfathers possessed, and thou shalt possess it; and he will do thee good,and multiply thee above thy fathers. 

{30:6} And the LORD thy God willcircumcise thine heart, and the heart of thy seed, to love the LORD thyGod with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, that thou mayest live.

{30:7} And the LORD thy God will put all these curses upon thineenemies, and on them that hate thee, which persecuted thee. 

{30:8} Andthou shalt return and obey the voice of the LORD, and do all hiscommandments which I command thee this day. 

{30:9} And the LORD thy Godwill make thee plenteous in every work of thine hand, in the fruit ofthy body, and in the fruit of thy cattle, and in the fruit of thy land,for good: for the LORD will again rejoice over thee for good, as herejoiced over thy fathers: 

{30:10} If thou shalt hearken unto the voiceof the LORD thy God, to keep his commandments and his statutes whichare written in this book of the law, [and] if thou turn unto the LORDthy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul.   

{30:11} For this commandment which I command thee this day, it [is]not hidden from thee, neither [is] it far off. 

{30:12} It [is] not inheaven, that thou shouldest say, Who shall go up for us to heaven, andbring it unto us, that we may hear it, and do it? 

{30:13} Neither [is]it beyond the sea, that thou shouldest say, Who shall go over the seafor us, and bring it unto us, that we may hear it, and do it? 

{30:14}But the word [is] very nigh unto thee, in thy mouth, and in thy heart,that thou mayest do it.   

{30:15} See, I have set before thee this day life and good, anddeath and evil; 

{30:16} In that I command thee this day to love theLORD thy God, to walk in his ways, and to keep his commandments and hisstatutes and his judgments, that thou mayest live and multiply: and theLORD thy God shall bless thee in the land whither thou goest to possessit. 

{30:17} But if thine heart turn away, so that thou wilt not hear,but shalt be drawn away, and worship other gods, and serve them;

{30:18} I denounce unto you this day, that ye shall surely perish, [andthat] ye shall not prolong [your] days upon the land, whither thoupassest over Jordan to go to possess it. 

{30:19} I call heaven andearth to record this day against you, [that] I have set before you lifeand death, blessing and cursing: therefore choose life, that both thouand thy seed may live: 

{30:20} That thou mayest love the LORD thy God,[and] that thou mayest obey his voice, and that thou mayest cleave untohim: for he [is] thy life, and the length of thy days: that thou mayestdwell in the land which the LORD sware unto thy fathers, to Abraham, toIsaac, and to Jacob, to give them.   

{31:1} And Moses went and spake these words unto all Israel. 

{31:2}And he said unto them, I [am] an hundred and twenty years old this day;I can no more go out and come in: also the LORD hath said unto me, Thoushalt not go over this Jordan. 

{31:3} The LORD thy God, he will go overbefore thee, [and] he will destroy these nations from before thee, andthou shalt possess them: [and] Joshua, he shall go over before thee, asthe LORD hath said. 

{31:4} And the LORD shall do unto them as he did toSihon and to Og, kings of the Amorites, and unto the land of them, whomhe destroyed. 

{31:5} And the LORD shall give them up before your face,that ye may do unto them according unto all the commandments which Ihave commanded you. 

{31:6} Be strong and of a good courage, fear not,nor be afraid of them: for the LORD thy God, he [it is] that doth gowith thee; he will not fail thee, nor forsake thee.   

{31:7} And Moses called unto Joshua, and said unto him in the sightof all Israel, Be strong and of a good courage: for thou must go withthis people unto the land which the LORD hath sworn unto their fathersto give them; and thou shalt cause them to inherit it. 

{31:8} And theLORD, he [it is] that doth go before thee; he will be with thee, hewill not fail thee, neither forsake thee: fear not, neither be dismayed.   

{31:9} And Moses wrote this law, and delivered it unto the prieststhe sons of Levi, which bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD, andunto all the elders of Israel. 

{31:10} And Moses commanded them,saying, At the end of [every] seven years, in the solemnity of the yearof release, in the feast of tabernacles, 

{31:11} When all Israel iscome to appear before the LORD thy God in the place which he shallchoose, thou shalt read this law before all Israel in their hearing.

{31:12} Gather the people together, men, and women, and children, andthy stranger that [is] within thy gates, that they may hear, and thatthey may learn, and fear the LORD your God, and observe to do all thewords of this law: 

{31:13} And [that] their children, which have notknown [any thing,] may hear, and learn to fear the LORD your God, aslong as ye live in the land whither ye go over Jordan to possess it.   

{31:14} And the LORD said unto Moses, Behold, thy days approach thatthou must die: call Joshua, and present yourselves in the tabernacle ofthe congregation, that I may give him a charge. And Moses and Joshuawent, and presented themselves in the tabernacle of the congregation.

{31:15} And the LORD appeared in the tabernacle in a pillar of a cloud:and the pillar of the cloud stood over the door of the tabernacle.   

{31:16} And the LORD said unto Moses, Behold, thou shalt sleep withthy fathers; and this people will rise up, and go a whoring after thegods of the strangers of the land, whither they go [to be] among them,and will forsake me, and break my covenant which I have made with them.

{31:17} Then my anger shall be kindled against them in that day, and Iwill forsake them, and I will hide my face from them, and they shall bedevoured, and many evils and troubles shall befall them; so that theywill say in that day. Are not these evils come upon us, because our God[is] not among us? 

{31:18} And I will surely hide my face in that dayfor all the evils which they shall have wrought, in that they areturned unto other gods. 

{31:19} Now therefore write ye this song foryou, and teach it the children of Israel: put it in their mouths, thatthis song may be a witness for me against the children of Israel.

{31:20} For when I shall have brought them into the land which I swareunto their fathers, that floweth with milk and honey; and they shallhave eaten and filled themselves, and waxen fat; then will they turnunto other gods, and serve them, and provoke me, and break my covenant.

{31:21} And it shall come to pass, when many evils and troubles arebefallen them, that this song shall testify against them as a witness;for it shall not be forgotten out of the mouths of their seed: for Iknow their imagination which they go about, even now, before I havebrought them into the land which I sware.   

{31:22} Moses therefore wrote this song the same day, and taught itthe children of Israel. 

{31:23} And he gave Joshua the son of Nun acharge, and said, Be strong and of a good courage: for thou shalt bringthe children of Israel into the land which I sware unto them: and Iwill be with thee.   

{31:24} And it came to pass, when Moses had made an end of writingthe words of this law in a book, until they were finished, 

{31:25} ThatMoses commanded the Levites, which bare the ark of the covenant of theLORD, saying, 

{31:26} Take this book of the law, and put it in the sideof the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God, that it may be therefor a witness against thee. 

{31:27} For I know thy rebellion, and thystiff neck: behold, while I am yet alive with you this day, ye havebeen rebellious against the LORD; and how much more after my death?   

{31:28} Gather unto me all the elders of your tribes, and yourofficers, that I may speak these words in their ears, and call heavenand earth to record against them. 

{31:29} For I know that after mydeath ye will utterly corrupt [yourselves,] and turn aside from the waywhich I have commanded you; and evil will befall you in the latterdays; because ye will do evil in the sight of the LORD, to provoke himto anger through the work of your hands. 

{31:30} And Moses spake in theears of all the congregation of Israel the words of this song, untilthey were ended.   

{32:1} Give ear, O ye heavens, and I will speak; and hear, O earth,the words of my mouth. 

{32:2} My doctrine shall drop as the rain, myspeech shall distil as the dew, as the small rain upon the tender herb,and as the showers upon the grass: 

{32:3} Because I will publish thename of the LORD: ascribe ye greatness unto our God. 

{32:4} [He is] theRock, his work [is] perfect: for all his ways [are] judgment: a God oftruth and without iniquity, just and right [is] he. 

{32:5} They havecorrupted themselves, their spot [is] not [the spot] of his children:[they are] a perverse and crooked generation. 

{32:6} Do ye thus requitethe LORD, O foolish people and unwise? [is] not he thy father [that]hath bought thee? hath he not made thee, and established thee?   

{32:7} Remember the days of old, consider the years of manygenerations: ask thy father, and he will shew thee; thy elders, andthey will tell thee. 

{32:8} When the most High divided to the nationstheir inheritance, when he separated the sons of Adam, he set thebounds of the people according to the number of the children of Israel.

{32:9} For the LORD'S portion [is] his people; Jacob [is] the lot ofhis inheritance. 

{32:10} He found him in a desert land, and in thewaste howling wilderness; he led him about, he instructed him, he kepthim as the apple of his eye. 

{32:11} As an eagle stirreth up her nest,fluttereth over her young, spreadeth abroad her wings, taketh them,beareth them on her wings: 

{32:12} [So] the LORD alone did lead him,and [there was] no strange god with him. 

{32:13} He made him ride onthe high places of the earth, that he might eat the increase of thefields; and he made him to suck honey out of the rock, and oil out ofthe flinty rock; 

{32:14} Butter of kine, and milk of sheep, with fat oflambs, and rams of the breed of Bashan, and goats, with the fat ofkidneys of wheat; and thou didst drink the pure blood of the grape.   

{32:15} But Jeshurun waxed fat, and kicked: thou art waxen fat, thouart grown thick, thou art covered [with fatness;] then he forsook God[which] made him, and lightly esteemed the Rock of his salvation.

{32:16} They provoked him to jealousy with strange [gods,] withabominations provoked they him to anger. 

{32:17} They sacrificed untodevils, not to God; to gods whom they knew not, to new [gods that] camenewly up, whom your fathers feared not. 

{32:18} Of the Rock [that]begat thee thou art unmindful, and hast forgotten God that formed thee.

{32:19} And when the LORD saw [it,] he abhorred [them,] because of theprovoking of his sons, and of his daughters. 

{32:20} And he said, Iwill hide my face from them, I will see what their end [shall be:] forthey [are] a very froward generation, children in whom [is] no faith.

{32:21} They have moved me to jealousy with [that which is] not God;they have provoked me to anger with their vanities: and I will movethem to jealousy with [those which are] not a people; I will provokethem to anger with a foolish nation. 

{32:22} For a fire is kindled inmine anger, and shall burn unto the lowest hell, and shall consume theearth with her increase, and set on fire the foundations of themountains. 

{32:23} I will heap mischiefs upon them; I will spend minearrows upon them. 

{32:24} [They shall be] burnt with hunger, anddevoured with burning heat, and with bitter destruction: I will alsosend the teeth of beasts upon them, with the poison of serpents of thedust. 

{32:25} The sword without, and terror within, shall destroy boththe young man and the virgin, the suckling [also] with the man of grayhairs. 

{32:26} I said, I would scatter them into corners, I would makethe remembrance of them to cease from among men: 

{32:27} Were it notthat I feared the wrath of the enemy, lest their adversaries shouldbehave themselves strangely, [and] lest they should say, Our hand ishigh, and the LORD hath not done all this. 

{32:28} For they [are] anation void of counsel, neither [is there any] understanding in them.

{32:29} O that they were wise, [that] they understood this, [that] theywould consider their latter end! 

{32:30} How should one chase athousand, and two put ten thousand to flight, except their Rock hadsold them, and the LORD had shut them up? 

{32:31} For their rock [is]not as our Rock, even our enemies themselves [being] judges. 

{32:32}For their vine [is] of the vine of Sodom, and of the fields ofGomorrah: their grapes [are] grapes of gall, their clusters [are]bitter: 

{32:33} Their wine [is] the poison of dragons, and the cruelvenom of asps. 

{32:34} [Is] not this laid up in store with me, [and]sealed up among my treasures? 

{32:35} To me [belongeth] vengeance, andrecompence; their foot shall slide in [due] time: for the day of theircalamity [is] at hand, and the things that shall come upon them makehaste. 

{32:36} For the LORD shall judge his people, and repent himselffor his servants, when he seeth that [their] power is gone, and [thereis] none shut up, or left. 

{32:37} And he shall say, Where [are] theirgods, [their] rock in whom they trusted, 

{32:38} Which did eat the fatof their sacrifices, [and] drank the wine of their drink offerings? letthem rise up and help you, [and] be your protection. 

{32:39} See nowthat I, [even] I, [am] he, and [there is] no god with me: I kill, and Imake alive; I wound, and I heal: neither [is there any] that candeliver out of my hand. 

{32:40} For I lift up my hand to heaven, andsay, I live for ever. 

{32:41} If I whet my glittering sword, and minehand take hold on judgment; I will render vengeance to mine enemies,and will reward them that hate me. 

{32:42} I will make mine arrowsdrunk with blood, and my sword shall devour flesh; [and that] with theblood of the slain and of the captives, from the beginning of revengesupon the enemy. 

{32:43} Rejoice, O ye nations, [with] his people: forhe will avenge the blood of his servants, and will render vengeance tohis adversaries, and will be merciful unto his land, [and] to hispeople.   

{32:44} And Moses came and spake all the words of this song in theears of the people, he, and Hoshea the son of Nun. 

{32:45} And Mosesmade an end of speaking all these words to all Israel: 

{32:46} And hesaid unto them, Set your hearts unto all the words which I testifyamong you this day, which ye shall command your children to observe todo, all the words of this law. 

{32:47} For it [is] not a vain thing foryou; because it [is] your life: and through this thing ye shall prolong[your] days in the land, whither ye go over Jordan to possess it.

{32:48} And the LORD spake unto Moses that selfsame day, saying,

{32:49} Get thee up into this mountain Abarim, [unto] mount Nebo, which[is] in the land of Moab, that [is] over against Jericho; and beholdthe land of Canaan, which I give unto the children of Israel for apossession: 

{32:50} And die in the mount whither thou goest up, and begathered unto thy people; as Aaron thy brother died in mount Hor, andwas gathered unto his people: 

{32:51} Because ye trespassed against meamong the children of Israel at the waters of Meribah-Kadesh, in thewilderness of Zin; because ye sanctified me not in the midst of thechildren of Israel. 

{32:52} Yet thou shalt see the land before [thee;]but thou shalt not go thither unto the land which I give the childrenof Israel.   

{33:1} And this [is] the blessing, wherewith Moses the man of Godblessed the children of Israel before his death. 

{33:2} And he said,The LORD came from Sinai, and rose up from Seir unto them; he shinedforth from mount Paran, and he came with ten thousands of saints: fromhis right hand [went] a fiery law for them. 

{33:3} Yea, he loved thepeople; all his saints [are] in thy hand: and they sat down at thyfeet; [every one] shall receive of thy words. 

{33:4} Moses commanded usa law, [even] the inheritance of the congregation of Jacob. 

{33:5} Andhe was king in Jeshurun, when the heads of the people [and] the tribesof Israel were gathered together.   

{33:6} Let Reuben live, and not die; and let [not] his men be few.   

{33:7} And this [is the blessing] of Judah: and he said, Hear, LORD,the voice of Judah, and bring him unto his people: let his hands besufficient for him; and be thou an help [to him] from his enemies.

{33:8} And of Levi he said, [Let] thy Thummim and thy Urim [be] withthy holy one, whom thou didst prove at Massah, [and with] whom thoudidst strive at the waters of Meribah; 

{33:9} Who said unto his fatherand to his mother, I have not seen him; neither did he acknowledge hisbrethren, nor knew his own children: for they have observed thy word,and kept thy covenant. 

{33:10} They shall teach Jacob thy judgments,and Israel thy law: they shall put incense before thee, and whole burntsacrifice upon thine altar. 

{33:11} Bless, LORD, his substance, andaccept the work of his hands: smite through the loins of them that riseagainst him, and of them that hate him, that they rise not again.   

{33:12} [And] of Benjamin he said, The beloved of the LORD shalldwell in safety by him; [and the LORD] shall cover him all the daylong, and he shall dwell between his shoulders.   

{33:13} And of Joseph he said, Blessed of the LORD [be] his land,for the precious things of heaven, for the dew, and for the deep thatcoucheth beneath, 

{33:14} And for the precious fruits [brought forth]by the sun, and for the precious things put forth by the moon, 

{33:15}And for the chief things of the ancient mountains, and for the preciousthings of the lasting hills, 

{33:16} And for the precious things of theearth and fulness thereof, and [for] the good will of him that dwelt inthe bush: let [the blessing] come upon the head of Joseph, and upon thetop of the head of him [that was] separated from his brethren. 

{33:17}His glory [is like] the firstling of his bullock, and his horns [arelike] the horns of unicorns: with them he shall push the peopletogether to the ends of the earth: and they [are] the ten thousands ofEphraim, and they [are] the thousands of Manasseh.   

{33:18} And of Zebulun he said, Rejoice, Zebulun, in thy going out;and, Issachar, in thy tents. 

{33:19} They shall call the people untothe mountain; there they shall offer sacrifices of righteousness: forthey shall suck [of] the abundance of the seas, and [of] treasures hidin the sand.   

{33:20} And of Gad he said, Blessed [be] he that enlargeth Gad: hedwelleth as a lion, and teareth the arm with the crown of the head.

{33:21} And he provided the first part for himself, because there, [in]a portion of the lawgiver, [was he] seated; and he came with the headsof the people, he executed the justice of the LORD, and his judgmentswith Israel.   

{33:22} And of Dan he said, Dan [is] a lion's whelp: he shall leapfrom Bashan.   

{33:23} And of Naphtali he said, O Naphtali, satisfied with favour,and full with the blessing of the LORD: possess thou the west and thesouth.   

{33:24} And of Asher he said, [Let] Asher [be] blessed withchildren; let him be acceptable to his brethren, and let him dip hisfoot in oil. 

{33:25} Thy shoes [shall be] iron and brass; and as thydays, [so shall] thy strength [be.]   

{33:26} [There is] none like unto the God of Jeshurun, [who] ridethupon the heaven in thy help, and in his excellency on the sky. 

{33:27}The eternal God [is thy] refuge, and underneath [are] the everlastingarms: and he shall thrust out the enemy from before thee; and shallsay, Destroy [them. ]

{33:28} Israel then shall dwell in safety alone:the fountain of Jacob [shall be] upon a land of corn and wine; also hisheavens shall drop down dew. 

{33:29} Happy [art] thou, O Israel: who[is] like unto thee, O people saved by the LORD, the shield of thyhelp, and who [is] the sword of thy excellency! and thine enemies shallbe found liars unto thee; and thou shalt tread upon their high places.   

{34:1} And Moses went up from the plains of Moab unto the mountainof Nebo, to the top of Pisgah, that [is] over against Jericho. And theLORD shewed him all the land of Gilead, unto Dan, 

{34:2} And allNaphtali, and the land of Ephraim, and Manasseh, and all the land ofJudah, unto the utmost sea, 

{34:3} And the south, and the plain of thevalley of Jericho, the city of palm trees, unto Zoar. 

{34:4} And theLORD said unto him, This [is] the land which I sware unto Abraham, untoIsaac, and unto Jacob, saying, I will give it unto thy seed: I havecaused thee to see [it] with thine eyes, but thou shalt not go overthither.   

{34:5} So Moses the servant of the LORD died there in the land ofMoab, according to the word of the LORD. 

{34:6} And he buried him in avalley in the land of Moab, over against Beth-peor: but no man knowethof his sepulchre unto this day.   

{34:7} And Moses [was] an hundred and twenty years old when he died:his eye was not dim, nor his natural force abated.   

{34:8} And the children of Israel wept for Moses in the plains ofMoab thirty days: so the days of weeping [and] mourning for Moses wereended.   

{34:9} And Joshua the son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom;for Moses had laid his hands upon him: and the children of Israelhearkened unto him, and did as the LORD commanded Moses.   

{34:10} And there arose not a prophet since in Israel like untoMoses, whom the LORD knew face to face, 

{34:11} In all the signs andthe wonders, which the LORD sent him to do in the land of Egypt toPharaoh, and to all his servants, and to all his land, 

{34:12} And inall that mighty hand, and in all the great terror which Moses shewed inthe sight of all Israel.
