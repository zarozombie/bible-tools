{The Third Epistle of John   

{1:1} The elder unto the wellbeloved Gaius, whom I love in the truth.   

{1:2} Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper andbe in health, even as thy soul prospereth. 

{1:3} For I rejoicedgreatly, when the brethren came and testified of the truth that is inthee, even as thou walkest in the truth. 

{1:4} I have no greater joythan to hear that my children walk in truth. 

{1:5} Beloved, thou doestfaithfully whatsoever thou doest to the brethren, and to strangers;

{1:6} Which have borne witness of thy charity before the church: whomif thou bring forward on their journey after a godly sort, thou shaltdo well: 

{1:7} Because that for his name's sake they went forth, takingnothing of the Gentiles. 

{1:8} We therefore ought to receive such, thatwe might be fellowhelpers to the truth.   

{1:9} I wrote unto the church: but Diotrephes, who loveth to havethe preeminence among them, receiveth us not. 

{1:10} Wherefore, if Icome, I will remember his deeds which he doeth, prating against us withmalicious words: and not content therewith, neither doth he himselfreceive the brethren, and forbiddeth them that would, and casteth[them] out of the church.   

{1:11} Beloved, follow not that which is evil, but that which isgood. He that doeth good is of God: but he that doeth evil hath notseen God. 

{1:12} Demetrius hath good report of all [men,] and of thetruth itself: yea, and we [also] bear record; and ye know that ourrecord is true.   

{1:13} I had many things to write, but I will not with ink and penwrite unto thee: 

{1:14} But I trust I shall shortly see thee, and weshall speak face to face. Peace [be] to thee. [Our] friends salutethee. Greet the friends by name.
