{The Epistle to the Hebrews   

{1:1} God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in timepast unto the fathers by the prophets, 

{1:2} Hath in these last daysspoken unto us by [his] Son, whom he hath appointed heir of all things,by whom also he made the worlds; 

{1:3} Who being the brightness of[his] glory, and the express image of his person, and upholding allthings by the word of his power, when he had by himself purged oursins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high; 

{1:4} Beingmade so much better than the angels, as he hath by inheritance obtaineda more excellent name than they. 

{1:5} For unto which of the angelssaid he at any time, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee?And again, I will be to him a Father, and he shall be to me a Son?

{1:6} And again, when he bringeth in the firstbegotten into the world,he saith, And let all the angels of God worship him. 

{1:7} And of theangels he saith, Who maketh his angels spirits, and his ministers aflame of fire. 

{1:8} But unto the Son [he saith,] Thy throne, O God,[is] for ever and ever: a sceptre of righteousness [is] the sceptre ofthy kingdom. 

{1:9} Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity;therefore God, [even] thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil ofgladness above thy fellows. 

{1:10} And, Thou, Lord, in the beginninghast laid the foundation of the earth; and the heavens are the works ofthine hands: 

{1:11} They shall perish; but thou remainest; and they allshall wax old as doth a garment; 

{1:12} And as a vesture shalt thoufold them up, and they shall be changed: but thou art the same, and thyyears shall not fail. 

{1:13} But to which of the angels said he at anytimes, Sit on my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool?

{1:14} Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister forthem who shall be heirs of salvation?   

{2:1} Therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the thingswhich we have heard, lest at any time we should let [them] slip. 

{2:2}For if the word spoken by angels was stedfast, and every transgressionand disobedience received a just recompence of reward; 

{2:3} How shallwe escape, if we neglect so great salvation; which at the first beganto be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed unto us by them that heard[him; ]

{2:4} God also bearing [them] witness, both with signs andwonders, and with divers miracles, and gifts of the Holy Ghost,according to his own will?   

{2:5} For unto the angels hath he not put in subjection the world tocome, whereof we speak. 

{2:6} But one in a certain place testified,saying, What is man, that thou art mindful of him? or the son of man,that thou visitest him? 

{2:7} Thou madest him a little lower than theangels; thou crownedst him with glory and honour, and didst set himover the works of thy hands: 

{2:8} Thou hast put all things insubjection under his feet. For in that he put all in subjection underhim, he left nothing [that is] not put under him. But now we see notyet all things put under him. 

{2:9} But we see Jesus, who was made alittle lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned withglory and honour; that he by the grace of God should taste death forevery man. 

{2:10} For it became him, for whom [are] all things, and bywhom [are] all things, in bringing many sons unto glory, to make thecaptain of their salvation perfect through sufferings. 

{2:11} For bothhe that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified [are] all of one: forwhich cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren, 

{2:12} Saying, Iwill declare thy name unto my brethren, in the midst of the church willI sing praise unto thee. 

{2:13} And again, I will put my trust in him.And again, Behold I and the children which God hath given me. 

{2:14}Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, healso himself likewise took part of the same; that through death hemight destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil;

{2:15} And deliver them who through fear of death were all theirlifetime subject to bondage. 

{2:16} For verily he took not on [him thenature of] angels; but he took on [him] the seed of Abraham. 

{2:17}Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto [his]brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest inthings [pertaining] to God, to make reconciliation for the sins of thepeople. 

{2:18} For in that he himself hath suffered being tempted, heis able to succour them that are tempted.   

{3:1} Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling,consider the Apostle and High Priest of our profession, Christ Jesus;

{3:2} Who was faithful to him that appointed him, as also Moses [wasfaithful] in all his house. 

{3:3} For this [man] was counted worthy ofmore glory than Moses, inasmuch as he who hath builded the house hathmore honour than the house. 

{3:4} For every house is builded by some[man;] but he that built all things [is] God. 

{3:5} And Moses verily[was] faithful in all his house, as a servant, for a testimony of thosethings which were to be spoken after; 

{3:6} But Christ as a son overhis own house; whose house are we, if we hold fast the confidence andthe rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end. 

{3:7} Wherefore (as theHoly Ghost saith, To day if ye will hear his voice, 

{3:8} Harden notyour hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of temptation in thewilderness: 

{3:9} When your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw myworks forty years. 

{3:10} Wherefore I was grieved with that generation,and said, They do alway err in [their] heart; and they have not knownmy ways. 

{3:11} So I sware in my wrath, They shall not enter into myrest.) 

{3:12} Take heed, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evilheart of unbelief, in departing from the living God. 

{3:13} But exhortone another daily, while it is called To day; lest any of you behardened through the deceitfulness of sin. 

{3:14} For we are madepartakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning of our confidencestedfast unto the end; 

{3:15} While it is said, To day if ye will hearhis voice, harden not your hearts, as in the provocation. 

{3:16} Forsome, when they had heard, did provoke: howbeit not all that came outof Egypt by Moses. 

{3:17} But with whom was he grieved forty years?[was it] not with them that had sinned, whose carcases fell in thewilderness? 

{3:18} And to whom sware he that they should not enter intohis rest, but to them that believed not? 

{3:19} So we see that theycould not enter in because of unbelief.   

{4:1} Let us therefore fear, lest, a promise being left [us] ofentering into his rest, any of you should seem to come short of it.

{4:2} For unto us was the gospel preached, as well as unto them: butthe word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith inthem that heard [it. ]

{4:3} For we which have believed do enter intorest, as he said, As I have sworn in my wrath, if they shall enter intomy rest: although the works were finished from the foundation of theworld. 

{4:4} For he spake in a certain place of the seventh [day] onthis wise, And God did rest the seventh day from all his works. 

{4:5}And in this [place] again, If they shall enter into my rest. 

{4:6}Seeing therefore it remaineth that some must enter therein, and they towhom it was first preached entered not in because of unbelief: 

{4:7}Again, he limiteth a certain day, saying in David, To day, after solong a time; as it is said, To day if ye will hear his voice, hardennot your hearts. 

{4:8} For if Jesus had given them rest, then would henot afterward have spoken of another day. 

{4:9} There remaineththerefore a rest to the people of God. 

{4:10} For he that is enteredinto his rest, he also hath ceased from his own works, as God [did]from his. 

{4:11} Let us labour therefore to enter into that rest, lestany man fall after the same example of unbelief. 

{4:12} For the word ofGod [is] quick, and powerful, and sharper than any twoedged sword,piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of thejoints and marrow, and [is] a discerner of the thoughts and intents ofthe heart. 

{4:13} Neither is there any creature that is not manifest inhis sight: but all things [are] naked and opened unto the eyes of himwith whom we have to do. 

{4:14} Seeing then that we have a great highpriest, that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let ushold fast [our] profession. 

{4:15} For we have not an high priest whichcannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in allpoints tempted like as [we are, yet] without sin. 

{4:16} Let ustherefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtainmercy, and find grace to help in time of need.   

{5:1} For every high priest taken from among men is ordained for menin things [pertaining] to God, that he may offer both gifts andsacrifices for sins: 

{5:2} Who can have compassion on the ignorant, andon them that are out of the way; for that he himself also is compassedwith infirmity. 

{5:3} And by reason hereof he ought, as for the people,so also for himself, to offer for sins. 

{5:4} And no man taketh thishonour unto himself, but he that is called of God, as [was] Aaron.

{5:5} So also Christ glorified not himself to be made an high priest;but he that said unto him, Thou art my Son, to day have I begottenthee. 

{5:6} As he saith also in another [place,] Thou [art] a priestfor ever after the order of Melchisedec. 

{5:7} Who in the days of hisflesh, when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strongcrying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death, and washeard in that he feared; 

{5:8} Though he were a Son, yet learned heobedience by the things which he suffered; 

{5:9} And being madeperfect, he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them thatobey him; 

{5:10} Called of God an high priest after the order ofMelchisedec.   

{5:11} Of whom we have many things to say, and hard to be uttered,seeing ye are dull of hearing. 

{5:12} For when for the time ye ought tobe teachers, ye have need that one teach you again which [be] the firstprinciples of the oracles of God; and are become such as have need ofmilk, and not of strong meat. 

{5:13} For every one that useth milk [is]unskilful in the word of righteousness: for he is a babe. 

{5:14} Butstrong meat belongeth to them that are of full age, [even] those who byreason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil.   

{6:1} Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ,let us go on unto perfection; not laying again the foundation ofrepentance from dead works, and of faith toward God, 

{6:2} Of thedoctrine of baptisms, and of laying on of hands, and of resurrection ofthe dead, and of eternal judgment. 

{6:3} And this will we do, if Godpermit. 

{6:4} For [it is] impossible for those who were onceenlightened, and have tasted of the heavenly gift, and were madepartakers of the Holy Ghost, 

{6:5} And have tasted the good word ofGod, and the powers of the world to come, 

{6:6} If they shall fallaway, to renew them again unto repentance; seeing they crucify tothemselves the Son of God afresh, and put [him] to an open shame. 

{6:7}For the earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh oft upon it, andbringeth forth herbs meet for them by whom it is dressed, receivethblessing from God: 

{6:8} But that which beareth thorns and briers [is]rejected, and [is] nigh unto cursing; whose end [is] to be burned.

{6:9} But, beloved, we are persuaded better things of you, and thingsthat accompany salvation, though we thus speak. 

{6:10} For God [is] notunrighteous to forget your work and labour of love, which ye haveshewed toward his name, in that ye have ministered to the saints, anddo minister. 

{6:11} And we desire that every one of you do shew thesame diligence to the full assurance of hope unto the end: 

{6:12} Thatye be not slothful, but followers of them who through faith andpatience inherit the promises. 

{6:13} For when God made promise toAbraham, because he could swear by no greater, he sware by himself,

{6:14} Saying, Surely blessing I will bless thee, and multiplying Iwill multiply thee. 

{6:15} And so, after he had patiently endured, heobtained the promise. 

{6:16} For men verily swear by the greater: andan oath for confirmation [is] to them an end of all strife. 

{6:17}Wherein God, willing more abundantly to shew unto the heirs of promisethe immutability of his counsel, confirmed [it] by an oath: 

{6:18} Thatby two immutable things, in which [it was] impossible for God to lie,we might have a strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to layhold upon the hope set before us: 

{6:19} Which [hope] we have as ananchor of the soul, both sure and stedfast, and which entereth intothat within the veil; 

{6:20} Whither the forerunner is for us entered,[even] Jesus, made an high priest for ever after the order ofMelchisedec.   

{7:1} For this Melchisedec, king of Salem, priest of the most highGod, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, andblessed him; 

{7:2} To whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all; firstbeing by interpretation King of righteousness, and after that also Kingof Salem, which is, King of peace; 

{7:3} Without father, withoutmother, without descent, having neither beginning of days, nor end oflife; but made like unto the Son of God; abideth a priest continually.

{7:4} Now consider how great this man [was,] unto whom even thepatriarch Abraham gave the tenth of the spoils. 

{7:5} And verily theythat are of the sons of Levi, who receive the office of the priesthood,have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law,that is, of their brethren, though they come out of the loins ofAbraham: 

{7:6} But he whose descent is not counted from them receivedtithes of Abraham, and blessed him that had the promises. 

{7:7} Andwithout all contradiction the less is blessed of the better. 

{7:8} Andhere men that die receive tithes; but there he [receiveth them,] ofwhom it is witnessed that he liveth. 

{7:9} And as I may so say, Levialso, who receiveth tithes, payed tithes in Abraham. 

{7:10} For he wasyet in the loins of his father, when Melchisedec met him. 

{7:11} Iftherefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood, (for under itthe people received the law,) what further need [was there] thatanother priest should rise after the order of Melchisedec, and not becalled after the order of Aaron? 

{7:12} For the priesthood beingchanged, there is made of necessity a change also of the law. 

{7:13}For he of whom these things are spoken pertaineth to another tribe, ofwhich no man gave attendance at the altar. 

{7:14} For [it is] evidentthat our Lord sprang out of Juda; of which tribe Moses spake nothingconcerning priesthood. 

{7:15} And it is yet far more evident: for thatafter the similitude of Melchisedec there ariseth another priest,

{7:16} Who is made, not after the law of a carnal commandment, butafter the power of an endless life. 

{7:17} For he testifieth, Thou[art] a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec. 

{7:18} Forthere is verily a disannulling of the commandment going before for theweakness and unprofitableness thereof. 

{7:19} For the law made nothingperfect, but the bringing in of a better hope [did;] by the which wedraw nigh unto God. 

{7:20} And inasmuch as not without an oath [he wasmade priest: ]

{7:21} (For those priests were made without an oath; butthis with an oath by him that said unto him, The Lord sware and willnot repent, Thou [art] a priest for ever after the order ofMelchisedec:) 

{7:22} By so much was Jesus made a surety of a bettertestament. 

{7:23} And they truly were many priests, because they werenot suffered to continue by reason of death: 

{7:24} But this [man,]because he continueth ever, hath an unchangeable priesthood. 

{7:25}Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come untoGod by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them. 

{7:26}For such an high priest became us, [who is] holy, harmless, undefiled,separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens; 

{7:27} Whoneedeth not daily, as those high priests, to offer up sacrifice, firstfor his own sins, and then for the people's: for this he did once, whenhe offered up himself. 

{7:28} For the law maketh men high priests whichhave infirmity; but the word of the oath, which was since the law,[maketh] the Son, who is consecrated for evermore.   

{8:1} Now of the things which we have spoken [this is] the sum: Wehave such an high priest, who is set on the right hand of the throne ofthe Majesty in the heavens; 

{8:2} A minister of the sanctuary, and ofthe true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man. 

{8:3} Forevery high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices: wherefore[it is] of necessity that this man have somewhat also to offer. 

{8:4}For if he were on earth, he should not be a priest, seeing that thereare priests that offer gifts according to the law: 

{8:5} Who serve untothe example and shadow of heavenly things, as Moses was admonished ofGod when he was about to make the tabernacle: for, See, saith he,[that] thou make all things according to the pattern shewed to thee inthe mount. 

{8:6} But now hath he obtained a more excellent ministry, byhow much also he is the mediator of a better covenant, which wasestablished upon better promises. 

{8:7} For if that first [covenant]had been faultless, then should no place have been sought for thesecond. 

{8:8} For finding fault with them, he saith, Behold, the dayscome, saith the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house ofIsrael and with the house of Judah: 

{8:9} Not according to the covenantthat I made with their fathers in the day when I took them by the handto lead them out of the land of Egypt; because they continued not in mycovenant, and I regarded them not, saith the Lord. 

{8:10} For this [is]the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after thosedays, saith the Lord; I will put my laws into their mind, and writethem in their hearts: and I will be to them a God, and they shall be tome a people: 

{8:11} And they shall not teach every man his neighbour,and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for all shall knowme, from the least to the greatest. 

{8:12} For I will be merciful totheir unrighteousness, and their sins and their iniquities will Iremember no more. 

{8:13} In that he saith, A new [covenant,] he hathmade the first old. Now that which decayeth and waxeth old [is] readyto vanish away.   

{9:1} Then verily the first [covenant] had also ordinances of divineservice, and a worldly sanctuary. 

{9:2} For there was a tabernaclemade; the first, wherein [was] the candlestick, and the table, and theshewbread; which is called the sanctuary. 

{9:3} And after the secondveil, the tabernacle which is called the Holiest of all; 

{9:4} Whichhad the golden censer, and the ark of the covenant overlaid round aboutwith gold, wherein [was] the golden pot that had manna, and Aaron's rodthat budded, and the tables of the covenant; 

{9:5} And over it thecherubims of glory shadowing the mercyseat; of which we cannot nowspeak particularly. 

{9:6} Now when these things were thus ordained, thepriests went always into the first tabernacle, accomplishing theservice [of God. ]

{9:7} But into the second [went] the high priestalone once every year, not without blood, which he offered for himself,and [for] the errors of the people: 

{9:8} The Holy Ghost thissignifying, that the way into the holiest of all was not yet mademanifest, while as the first tabernacle was yet standing: 

{9:9} Which[was] a figure for the time then present, in which were offered bothgifts and sacrifices, that could not make him that did the serviceperfect, as pertaining to the conscience; 

{9:10} [Which stood] only inmeats and drinks, and divers washings, and carnal ordinances, imposed[on them] until the time of reformation. 

{9:11} But Christ being comean high priest of good things to come, by a greater and more perfecttabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this building;

{9:12} Neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own bloodhe entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternalredemption [for us. ]

{9:13} For if the blood of bulls and of goats, andthe ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean, sanctifieth to thepurifying of the flesh: 

{9:14} How much more shall the blood of Christ,who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God,purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God? 

{9:15}And for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament, that bymeans of death, for the redemption of the transgressions [that were]under the first testament, they which are called might receive thepromise of eternal inheritance. 

{9:16} For where a testament [is,]there must also of necessity be the death of the testator. 

{9:17} For atestament [is] of force after men are dead: otherwise it is of nostrength at all while the testator liveth. 

{9:18} Whereupon neither thefirst [testament] was dedicated without blood. 

{9:19} For when Moseshad spoken every precept to all the people according to the law, hetook the blood of calves and of goats, with water, and scarlet wool,and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book, and all the people, 

{9:20}Saying, This [is] the blood of the testament which God hath enjoinedunto you. 

{9:21} Moreover he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle,and all the vessels of the ministry. 

{9:22} And almost all things areby the law purged with blood; and without shedding of blood is noremission. 

{9:23} [It was] therefore necessary that the patterns ofthings in the heavens should be purified with these; but the heavenlythings themselves with better sacrifices than these. 

{9:24} For Christis not entered into the holy places made with hands, [which are] thefigures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear in thepresence of God for us: 

{9:25} Nor yet that he should offer himselfoften, as the high priest entereth into the holy place every year withblood of others; 

{9:26} For then must he often have suffered since thefoundation of the world: but now once in the end of the world hath heappeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself. 

{9:27} And as itis appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment: 

{9:28}So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto them thatlook for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation.   

{10:1} For the law having a shadow of good things to come, [and] notthe very image of the things, can never with those sacrifices whichthey offered year by year continually make the comers thereuntoperfect. 

{10:2} For then would they not have ceased to be offered?because that the worshippers once purged should have had no moreconscience of sins. 

{10:3} But in those [sacrifices there is] aremembrance again [made] of sins every year. 

{10:4} For [it is] notpossible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins.

{10:5} Wherefore when he cometh into the world, he saith, Sacrifice andoffering thou wouldest not, but a body hast thou prepared me: 

{10:6} Inburnt offerings and [sacrifices] for sin thou hast had no pleasure.

{10:7} Then said I, Lo, I come (in the volume of the book it is writtenof me,) to do thy will, O God. 

{10:8} Above when he said, Sacrifice andoffering and burnt offerings and [offering] for sin thou wouldest not,neither hadst pleasure [therein;] which are offered by the law; 

{10:9}Then said he, Lo, I come to do thy will, O God. He taketh away thefirst, that he may establish the second. 

{10:10} By the which will weare sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once[for all. ]

{10:11} And every priest standeth daily ministering andoffering oftentimes the same sacrifices, which can never take awaysins: 

{10:12} But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sinsfor ever, sat down on the right hand of God; 

{10:13} From henceforthexpecting till his enemies be made his footstool. 

{10:14} For by oneoffering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified. 

{10:15}[Whereof] the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us: for after that he hadsaid before, 

{10:16} This [is] the covenant that I will make with themafter those days, saith the Lord, I will put my laws into their hearts,and in their minds will I write them; 

{10:17} And their sins andiniquities will I remember no more. 

{10:18} Now where remission ofthese [is, there is] no more offering for sin.   

{10:19} Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into theholiest by the blood of Jesus, 

{10:20} By a new and living way, whichhe hath consecrated for us, through the veil, that is to say, hisflesh; 

{10:21} And [having] an high priest over the house of God;

{10:22} Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith,having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodieswashed with pure water. 

{10:23} Let us hold fast the profession of[our] faith without wavering; (for he is faithful that promised;)

{10:24} And let us consider one another to provoke unto love and togood works: 

{10:25} Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together,as the manner of some [is;] but exhorting [one another:] and so muchthe more, as ye see the day approaching. 

{10:26} For if we sin wilfullyafter that we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remainethno more sacrifice for sins, 

{10:27} But a certain fearful looking forof judgment and fiery indignation, which shall devour the adversaries.

{10:28} He that despised Moses' law died without mercy under two orthree witnesses: 

{10:29} Of how much sorer punishment, suppose ye,shall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God,and hath counted the blood of the covenant, wherewith he wassanctified, an unholy thing, and hath done despite unto the Spirit ofgrace? 

{10:30} For we know him that hath said, Vengeance [belongeth]unto me, I will recompense, saith the Lord. And again, The Lord shalljudge his people. 

{10:31} [It is] a fearful thing to fall into thehands of the living God. 

{10:32} But call to remembrance the formerdays, in which, after ye were illuminated, ye endured a great fight ofafflictions; 

{10:33} Partly, whilst ye were made a gazingstock both byreproaches and afflictions; and partly, whilst ye became companions ofthem that were so used. 

{10:34} For ye had compassion of me in mybonds, and took joyfully the spoiling of your goods, knowing inyourselves that ye have in heaven a better and an enduring substance.

{10:35} Cast not away therefore your confidence, which hath greatrecompence of reward. 

{10:36} For ye have need of patience, that, afterye have done the will of God, ye might receive the promise. 

{10:37} Foryet a little while, and he that shall come will come, and will nottarry. 

{10:38} Now the just shall live by faith: but if [any man] drawback, my soul shall have no pleasure in him. 

{10:39} But we are not ofthem who draw back unto perdition; but of them that believe to thesaving of the soul.   

{11:1} Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidenceof things not seen. 

{11:2} For by it the elders obtained a good report.

{11:3} Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by theword of God, so that things which are seen were not made of thingswhich do appear. 

{11:4} By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellentsacrifice than Cain, by which he obtained witness that he wasrighteous, God testifying of his gifts: and by it he being dead yetspeaketh. 

{11:5} By faith Enoch was translated that he should not seedeath; and was not found, because God had translated him: for beforehis translation he had this testimony, that he pleased God. 

{11:6} Butwithout faith [it is] impossible to please [him:] for he that cometh toGod must believe that he is, and [that] he is a rewarder of them thatdiligently seek him. 

{11:7} By faith Noah, being warned of God ofthings not seen as yet, moved with fear, prepared an ark to the savingof his house; by the which he condemned the world, and became heir ofthe righteousness which is by faith. 

{11:8} By faith Abraham, when hewas called to go out into a place which he should after receive for aninheritance, obeyed; and he went out, not knowing whither he went.

{11:9} By faith he sojourned in the land of promise, as [in] a strangecountry, dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs withhim of the same promise: 

{11:10} For he looked for a city which hathfoundations, whose builder and maker [is] God. 

{11:11} Through faithalso Sara herself received strength to conceive seed, and was deliveredof a child when she was past age, because she judged him faithful whohad promised. 

{11:12} Therefore sprang there even of one, and him asgood as dead, [so many] as the stars of the sky in multitude, and asthe sand which is by the sea shore innumerable. 

{11:13} These all diedin faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afaroff, and were persuaded of [them,] and embraced [them,] and confessedthat they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth. 

{11:14} For theythat say such things declare plainly that they seek a country. 

{11:15}And truly, if they had been mindful of that [country] from whence theycame out, they might have had opportunity to have returned. 

{11:16} Butnow they desire a better [country,] that is, an heavenly: wherefore Godis not ashamed to be called their God: for he hath prepared for them acity. 

{11:17} By faith Abraham, when he was tried, offered up Isaac:and he that had received the promises offered up his only begotten[son, ]

{11:18} Of whom it was said, That in Isaac shall thy seed becalled: 

{11:19} Accounting that God [was] able to raise [him] up, evenfrom the dead; from whence also he received him in a figure. 

{11:20} Byfaith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning things to come. 

{11:21}By faith Jacob, when he was a dying, blessed both the sons of Joseph;and worshipped, [leaning] upon the top of his staff. 

{11:22} By faithJoseph, when he died, made mention of the departing of the children ofIsrael; and gave commandment concerning his bones. 

{11:23} By faithMoses, when he was born, was hid three months of his parents, becausethey saw [he was] a proper child; and they were not afraid of theking's commandment. 

{11:24} By faith Moses, when he was come to years,refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter; 

{11:25} Choosingrather to suffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy thepleasures of sin for a season; 

{11:26} Esteeming the reproach of Christgreater riches than the treasures in Egypt: for he had respect unto therecompence of the reward. 

{11:27} By faith he forsook Egypt, notfearing the wrath of the king: for he endured, as seeing him who isinvisible. 

{11:28} Through faith he kept the passover, and thesprinkling of blood, lest he that destroyed the firstborn should touchthem. 

{11:29} By faith they passed through the Red sea as by dry[land:] which the Egyptians assaying to do were drowned. 

{11:30} Byfaith the walls of Jericho fell down, after they were compassed aboutseven days. 

{11:31} By faith the harlot Rahab perished not with themthat believed not, when she had received the spies with peace. 

{11:32}And what shall I more say? for the time would fail me to tell ofGedeon, and [of] Barak, and [of] Samson, and [of] Jephthae; [of] Davidalso, and Samuel, and [of] the prophets: 

{11:33} Who through faithsubdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises, stopped themouths of lions, 

{11:34} Quenched the violence of fire, escaped theedge of the sword, out of weakness were made strong, waxed valiant infight, turned to flight the armies of the aliens. 

{11:35} Womenreceived their dead raised to life again: and others were tortured, notaccepting deliverance; that they might obtain a better resurrection:

{11:36} And others had trial of [cruel] mockings and scourgings, yea,moreover of bonds and imprisonment: 

{11:37} They were stoned, they weresawn asunder, were tempted, were slain with the sword: they wanderedabout in sheepskins and goatskins; being destitute, afflicted,tormented; 

{11:38} (Of whom the world was not worthy:) they wandered indeserts, and [in] mountains, and [in] dens and caves of the earth.

{11:39} And these all, having obtained a good report through faith,received not the promise: 

{11:40} God having provided some better thingfor us, that they without us should not be made perfect.   

{12:1} Wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great acloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin whichdoth so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that isset before us, 

{12:2} Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of[our] faith; who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross,despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne ofGod. 

{12:3} For consider him that endured such contradiction of sinnersagainst himself, lest ye be wearied and faint in your minds. 

{12:4} Yehave not yet resisted unto blood, striving against sin. 

{12:5} And yehave forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as untochildren, My son, despise not thou the chastening of the Lord, norfaint when thou art rebuked of him: 

{12:6} For whom the Lord loveth hechasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth. 

{12:7} If yeendure chastening, God dealeth with you as with sons; for what son ishe whom the father chasteneth not? 

{12:8} But if ye be withoutchastisement, whereof all are partakers, then are ye bastards, and notsons. 

{12:9} Furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh whichcorrected [us,] and we gave [them] reverence: shall we not much ratherbe in subjection unto the Father of spirits, and live? 

{12:10} For theyverily for a few days chastened [us] after their own pleasure; but hefor [our] profit, that [we] might be partakers of his holiness. 

{12:11}Now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous, but grievous:nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousnessunto them which are exercised thereby. 

{12:12} Wherefore lift up thehands which hang down, and the feeble knees; 

{12:13} And make straightpaths for your feet, lest that which is lame be turned out of the way;but let it rather be healed. 

{12:14} Follow peace with all [men,] andholiness, without which no man shall see the Lord: 

{12:15} Lookingdiligently lest any man fail of the grace of God; lest any root ofbitterness springing up trouble [you,] and thereby many be defiled;

{12:16} Lest there [be] any fornicator, or profane person, as Esau, whofor one morsel of meat sold his birthright. 

{12:17} For ye know howthat afterward, when he would have inherited the blessing, he wasrejected: for he found no place of repentance, though he sought itcarefully with tears. 

{12:18} For ye are not come unto the mount thatmight be touched, and that burned with fire, nor unto blackness, anddarkness, and tempest, 

{12:19} And the sound of a trumpet, and thevoice of words; [which] voice they that heard intreated that the wordshould not be spoken to them any more: 

{12:20} (For they could notendure that which was commanded, And if so much as a beast touch themountain, it shall be stoned, or thrust through with a dart: 

{12:21}And so terrible was the sight, [that] Moses said, I exceedingly fearand quake:) 

{12:22} But ye are come unto mount Sion, and unto the cityof the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerablecompany of angels, 

{12:23} To the general assembly and church of thefirstborn, which are written in heaven, and to God the Judge of all,and to the spirits of just men made perfect, 

{12:24} And to Jesus themediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling, thatspeaketh better things than [that of] Abel. 

{12:25} See that ye refusenot him that speaketh. For if they escaped not who refused him thatspake on earth, much more [shall not] we [escape,] if we turn away fromhim that [speaketh] from heaven: 

{12:26} Whose voice then shook theearth: but now he hath promised, saying, Yet once more I shake not theearth only, but also heaven. 

{12:27} And this [word,] Yet once more,signifieth the removing of those things that are shaken, as of thingsthat are made, that those things which cannot be shaken may remain.

{12:28} Wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved, let ushave grace, whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence andgodly fear: 

{12:29} For our God [is] a consuming fire.   

{13:1} Let brotherly love continue. 

{13:2} Be not forgetful toentertain strangers: for thereby some have entertained angels unawares.

{13:3} Remember them that are in bonds, as bound with them; [and] themwhich suffer adversity, as being yourselves also in the body. 

{13:4}Marriage [is] honourable in all, and the bed undefiled: butwhoremongers and adulterers God will judge. 

{13:5} [Let your]conversation [be] without covetousness; [and be] content with suchthings as ye have: for he hath said, I will never leave thee, norforsake thee. 

{13:6} So that we may boldly say, The Lord [is] myhelper, and I will not fear what man shall do unto me.   

{13:7} Remember them which have the rule over you, who have spokenunto you the word of God: whose faith follow, considering the end of[their] conversation. 

{13:8} Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and today, and for ever. 

{13:9} Be not carried about with divers and strangedoctrines. For [it is] a good thing that the heart be established withgrace; not with meats, which have not profited them that have beenoccupied therein. 

{13:10} We have an altar, whereof they have no rightto eat which serve the tabernacle. 

{13:11} For the bodies of thosebeasts, whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high priestfor sin, are burned without the camp. 

{13:12} Wherefore Jesus also,that he might sanctify the people with his own blood, suffered withoutthe gate. 

{13:13} Let us go forth therefore unto him without the camp,bearing his reproach. 

{13:14} For here have we no continuing city, butwe seek one to come. 

{13:15} By him therefore let us offer thesacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of [our]lips giving thanks to his name. 

{13:16} But to do good and tocommunicate forget not: for with such sacrifices God is well pleased.

{13:17} Obey them that have the rule over you, and submit yourselves:for they watch for your souls, as they that must give account, thatthey may do it with joy, and not with grief: for that [is] unprofitablefor you.   

{13:18} Pray for us: for we trust we have a good conscience, in allthings willing to live honestly. 

{13:19} But I beseech [you] the ratherto do this, that I may be restored to you the sooner. 

{13:20} Now theGod of peace, that brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus, thatgreat shepherd of the sheep, through the blood of the everlastingcovenant, 

{13:21} Make you perfect in every good work to do his will,working in you that which is wellpleasing in his sight, through JesusChrist; to whom [be] glory for ever and ever. Amen. 

{13:22} And Ibeseech you, brethren, suffer the word of exhortation: for I havewritten a letter unto you in few words. 

{13:23} Know ye that [our]brother Timothy is set at liberty; with whom, if he come shortly, Iwill see you.   

{13:24} Salute all them that have the rule over you, and all thesaints. They of Italy salute you.   

{13:25} Grace [be] with you all. Amen.
