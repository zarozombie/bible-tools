{The Second Epistle General of Peter   

{1:1} Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ, to themthat have obtained like precious faith with us through therighteousness of God and our Saviour Jesus Christ: 

{1:2} Grace andpeace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God, and of Jesusour Lord, 

{1:3} According as his divine power hath given unto us allthings that [pertain] unto life and godliness, through the knowledge ofhim that hath called us to glory and virtue: 

{1:4} Whereby are givenunto us exceeding great and precious promises: that by these ye mightbe partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption thatis in the world through lust. 

{1:5} And beside this, giving alldiligence, add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge; 

{1:6} Andto knowledge temperance; and to temperance patience; and to patiencegodliness; 

{1:7} And to godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherlykindness charity. 

{1:8} For if these things be in you, and abound, theymake [you that ye shall] neither [be] barren nor unfruitful in theknowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. 

{1:9} But he that lacketh thesethings is blind, and cannot see afar off, and hath forgotten that hewas purged from his old sins. 

{1:10} Wherefore the rather, brethren,give diligence to make your calling and election sure: for if ye dothese things, ye shall never fall: 

{1:11} For so an entrance shall beministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lordand Saviour Jesus Christ.   

{1:12} Wherefore I will not be negligent to put you always inremembrance of these things, though ye know [them,] and be establishedin the present truth. 

{1:13} Yea, I think it meet, as long as I am inthis tabernacle, to stir you up by putting [you] in remembrance; 

{1:14}Knowing that shortly I must put off [this] my tabernacle, even as ourLord Jesus Christ hath shewed me. 

{1:15} Moreover I will endeavour thatye may be able after my decease to have these things always inremembrance. 

{1:16} For we have not followed cunningly devised fables,when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord JesusChrist, but were eyewitnesses of his majesty. 

{1:17} For he receivedfrom God the Father honour and glory, when there came such a voice tohim from the excellent glory, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am wellpleased. 

{1:18} And this voice which came from heaven we heard, when wewere with him in the holy mount. 

{1:19} We have also a more sure wordof prophecy; whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a lightthat shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day stararise in your hearts: 

{1:20} Knowing this first, that no prophecy ofthe scripture is of any private interpretation. 

{1:21} For the prophecycame not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake [asthey were] moved by the Holy Ghost.   

{2:1} But there were false prophets also among the people, even asthere shall be false teachers among you, who privily shall bring indamnable heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bringupon themselves swift destruction. 

{2:2} And many shall follow theirpernicious ways; by reason of whom the way of truth shall be evilspoken of. 

{2:3} And through covetousness shall they with feigned wordsmake merchandise of you: whose judgment now of a long time lingerethnot, and their damnation slumbereth not. 

{2:4} For if God spared notthe angels that sinned, but cast [them] down to hell, and delivered[them] into chains of darkness, to be reserved unto judgment; 

{2:5} Andspared not the old world, but saved Noah the eighth [person,] apreacher of righteousness, bringing in the flood upon the world of theungodly; 

{2:6} And turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah into ashescondemned [them] with an overthrow, making [them] an ensample untothose that after should live ungodly; 

{2:7} And delivered just Lot,vexed with the filthy conversation of the wicked: 

{2:8} (For thatrighteous man dwelling among them, in seeing and hearing, vexed [his]righteous soul from day to day with [their] unlawful deeds;) 

{2:9} TheLord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations, and toreserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punished: 

{2:10} Butchiefly them that walk after the flesh in the lust of uncleanness, anddespise government. Presumptuous [are they,] selfwilled, they are notafraid to speak evil of dignities. 

{2:11} Whereas angels, which aregreater in power and might, bring not railing accusation against thembefore the Lord. 

{2:12} But these, as natural brute beasts, made to betaken and destroyed, speak evil of the things that they understand not;and shall utterly perish in their own corruption; 

{2:13} And shallreceive the reward of unrighteousness, [as] they that count it pleasureto riot in the daytime. Spots [they are] and blemishes, sportingthemselves with their own deceivings while they feast with you; 

{2:14}Having eyes full of adultery, and that cannot cease from sin; beguilingunstable souls: an heart they have exercised with covetous practices;cursed children: 

{2:15} Which have forsaken the right way, and are goneastray, following the way of Balaam [the son] of Bosor, who loved thewages of unrighteousness; 

{2:16} But was rebuked for his iniquity: thedumb ass speaking with man's voice forbad the madness of the prophet.

{2:17} These are wells without water, clouds that are carried with atempest; to whom the mist of darkness is reserved for ever. 

{2:18} Forwhen they speak great swelling [words] of vanity, they allure throughthe lusts of the flesh, [through much] wantonness, those that wereclean escaped from them who live in error. 

{2:19} While they promisethem liberty, they themselves are the servants of corruption: for ofwhom a man is overcome, of the same is he brought in bondage. 

{2:20}For if after they have escaped the pollutions of the world through theknowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, they are againentangled therein, and overcome, the latter end is worse with them thanthe beginning. 

{2:21} For it had been better for them not to have knownthe way of righteousness, than, after they have known [it,] to turnfrom the holy commandment delivered unto them. 

{2:22} But it ishappened unto them according to the true proverb, The dog [is] turnedto his own vomit again; and the sow that was washed to her wallowing inthe mire.   

{3:1} This second epistle, beloved, I now write unto you; in [both]which I stir up your pure minds by way of remembrance: 

{3:2} That yemay be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the holyprophets, and of the commandment of us the apostles of the Lord andSaviour: 

{3:3} Knowing this first, that there shall come in the lastdays scoffers, walking after their own lusts, 

{3:4} And saying, Whereis the promise of his coming? for since the fathers fell asleep, allthings continue as [they were] from the beginning of the creation.

{3:5} For this they willingly are ignorant of, that by the word of Godthe heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of the water and inthe water: 

{3:6} Whereby the world that then was, being overflowed withwater, perished: 

{3:7} But the heavens and the earth, which are now, bythe same word are kept in store, reserved unto fire against the day ofjudgment and perdition of ungodly men. 

{3:8} But, beloved, be notignorant of this one thing, that one day [is] with the Lord as athousand years, and a thousand years as one day. 

{3:9} The Lord is notslack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but islongsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but thatall should come to repentance. 

{3:10} But the day of the Lord will comeas a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away witha great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earthalso and the works that are therein shall be burned up. 

{3:11} [Seeing]then [that] all these things shall be dissolved, what manner [ofpersons] ought ye to be in [all] holy conversation and godliness,

{3:12} Looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God,wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elementsshall melt with fervent heat? 

{3:13} Nevertheless we, according to hispromise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwellethrighteousness. 

{3:14} Wherefore, beloved, seeing that ye look for suchthings, be diligent that ye may be found of him in peace, without spot,and blameless. 

{3:15} And account [that] the longsuffering of our Lord[is] salvation; even as our beloved brother Paul also according to thewisdom given unto him hath written unto you; 

{3:16} As also in all[his] epistles, speaking in them of these things; in which are somethings hard to be understood, which they that are unlearned andunstable wrest, as [they do] also the other scriptures, unto their owndestruction. 

{3:17} Ye therefore, beloved, seeing ye know [thesethings] before, beware lest ye also, being led away with the error ofthe wicked, fall from your own stedfastness. 

{3:18} But grow in grace,and [in] the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. To him[be] glory both now and for ever. Amen.
