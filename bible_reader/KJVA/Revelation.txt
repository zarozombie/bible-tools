{The Revelation of St. John the Divine

{1:1} The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto him, to shew unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass; and he sent and signified [it] by his angel unto his servant John: 

{1:2} Who bare record of the word of God, and of the testimony of Jesus Christ, and of all things that he saw. 

{1:3} Blessed [is] he that readeth, and they that hear the words of this prophecy, and keep those things which are written therein: for the time [is] at hand. 

{1:4} John to the seven churches which are in Asia: Grace [be] unto you, and peace, from him which is, and which was, and which is to come; and from the seven Spirits which are before his throne; 

{1:5} And from Jesus Christ, [who is] the faithful witness, [and] the first begotten of the dead, and the prince of the kings of the earth. Unto him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood,

{1:6} And hath made us kings and priests unto God and his Father; to him [be] glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen. 

{1:7} Behold, he cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see him, and they [also] which pierced him: and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him. Even so, Amen. 

{1:8} I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending, saith the Lord, which is, and which was, and which is to come, the Almighty.

{1:9} I John, who also am your brother, and companion in tribulation, and in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ, was in the isle that is called Patmos, for the word of God, and for the testimony of Jesus Christ. 

{1:10} I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day, and heard behind me a great voice, as of a trumpet, 

{1:11} Saying, I am Alpha and Omega, the first and the last: and, What thou seest, write in a book, and send [it] unto the seven churches which are in Asia; unto Ephesus, and unto Smyrna, and unto Pergamos, and unto Thyatira, and unto Sardis, and unto Philadelphia, and unto Laodicea.

{1:12} And I turned to see the voice that spake with me. And being turned, I saw seven golden candlesticks; 

{1:13} And in the midst of the seven candlesticks [one] like unto the Son of man, clothed with a garment down to the foot, and girt about the paps with a golden girdle.

{1:14} His head and [his] hairs [were] white like wool, as white as snow; and his eyes [were] as a flame of fire; 

{1:15} And his feet like unto fine brass, as if they burned in a furnace; and his voice as the sound of many waters. 

{1:16} And he had in his right hand seven stars: and out of his mouth went a sharp twoedged sword: and his countenance [was] as the sun shineth in his strength. 

{1:17} And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead. And he laid his right hand upon me, saying unto me, Fear not; I am the first and the last: 

{1:18} I [am] he that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for evermore, Amen; and have the keys of hell and of death.

{1:19} Write the things which thou hast seen, and the things which are, and the things which shall be hereafter; 

{1:20} The mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest in my right hand, and the seven golden candlesticks. The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches: and the seven candlesticks which thou sawest are the seven churches.

{2:1} Unto the angel of the church of Ephesus write; These things saith he that holdeth the seven stars in his right hand, who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks;

{2:2} I know thy works, and thy labour, and thy patience, and how thou canst not bear them which are evil: and thou hast tried them which say they are apostles, and are not, and hast found them liars: 

{2:3} And hast borne, and hast patience, and for my name's sake hast laboured, and hast not fainted.

{2:4} Nevertheless I have [somewhat] against thee, because thou hast left thy first love. 

{2:5} Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the first works; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will remove thy candlestick out of his place, except thou repent.

{2:6} But this thou hast, that thou hatest the deeds of the Nicolaitanes, which I also hate.

{2:7} He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midst of the paradise of God.

{2:8} And unto the angel of the church in Smyrna write; These things saith the first and the last, which was dead, and is alive; 

{2:9} I know thy works, and tribulation, and poverty, (but thou art rich) and [I know] the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews, and are not, but [are] the synagogue of Satan.

{2:10} Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer: behold, the devil shall cast [some] of you into prison, that ye may be tried; and ye shall have tribulation ten days: be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life. 

{2:11} He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; He that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death.

{2:12} And to the angel of the church in Pergamos write; These things saith he which hath the sharp sword with two edges;

{2:13} I know thy works, and where thou dwellest, [even] where Satan's seat [is:] and thou holdest fast my name, and hast not denied my faith, even in those days wherein Antipas [was] my faithful martyr, who was slain among you, where Satan dwelleth.

{2:14} But I have a few things against thee, because thou hast there them that hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balac to cast a stumblingblock before the children of Israel, to eat things sacrificed unto idols, and to commit fornication.

{2:15} So hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitanes, which thing I hate. 

{2:16} Repent; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth. 

{2:17} He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden manna, and will give him a white stone, and in the stone a new name written, which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth [it.]

{2:18} And unto the angel of the church in Thyatira write; These things saith the Son of God, who hath his eyes like unto a flame of fire, and his feet [are] like fine brass;

{2:19} I know thy works, andcharity, and service, and faith, and thy patience, and thy works; andthe last [to be] more than the first. 

{2:20} Notwithstanding I have afew things against thee, because thou sufferest that woman Jezebel,which calleth herself a prophetess, to teach and to seduce my servantsto commit fornication, and to eat things sacrificed unto idols. 

{2:21}And I gave her space to repent of her fornication; and she repentednot. 

{2:22} Behold, I will cast her into a bed, and them that commitadultery with her into great tribulation, except they repent of theirdeeds. 

{2:23} And I will kill her children with death; and all thechurches shall know that I am he which searcheth the reins and hearts:and I will give unto every one of you according to your works. 

{2:24}But unto you I say, and unto the rest in Thyatira, as many as have notthis doctrine, and which have not known the depths of Satan, as theyspeak; I will put upon you none other burden. 

{2:25} But that which yehave [already] hold fast till I come. 

{2:26} And he that overcometh,and keepeth my works unto the end, to him will I give power over thenations: 

{2:27} And he shall rule them with a rod of iron; as thevessels of a potter shall they be broken to shivers: even as I receivedof my Father. 

{2:28} And I will give him the morning star. 

{2:29} Hethat hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches.   

{3:1} And unto the angel of the church in Sardis write; These thingssaith he that hath the seven Spirits of God, and the seven stars; Iknow thy works, that thou hast a name that thou livest, and art dead.

{3:2} Be watchful, and strengthen the things which remain, that areready to die: for I have not found thy works perfect before God. 

{3:3}Remember therefore how thou hast received and heard, and hold fast, andrepent. If therefore thou shalt not watch, I will come on thee as athief, and thou shalt not know what hour I will come upon thee. 

{3:4}Thou hast a few names even in Sardis which have not defiled theirgarments; and they shall walk with me in white: for they are worthy.

{3:5} He that overcometh, the same shall be clothed in white raiment;and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life, but I willconfess his name before my Father, and before his angels. 

{3:6} He thathath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches.   

{3:7} And to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write; Thesethings saith he that is holy, he that is true, he that hath the key ofDavid, he that openeth, and no man shutteth; and shutteth, and no manopeneth; 

{3:8} I know thy works: behold, I have set before thee an opendoor, and no man can shut it: for thou hast a little strength, and hastkept my word, and hast not denied my name. 

{3:9} Behold, I will makethem of the synagogue of Satan, which say they are Jews, and are not,but do lie; behold, I will make them to come and worship before thyfeet, and to know that I have loved thee. 

{3:10} Because thou hast keptthe word of my patience, I also will keep thee from the hour oftemptation, which shall come upon all the world, to try them that dwellupon the earth. 

{3:11} Behold, I come quickly: hold that fast whichthou hast, that no man take thy crown. 

{3:12} Him that overcometh willI make a pillar in the temple of my God, and he shall go no more out:and I will write upon him the name of my God, and the name of the cityof my God, [which is] new Jerusalem, which cometh down out of heavenfrom my God: and [I will write upon him] my new name. 

{3:13} He thathath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches.   

{3:14} And unto the angel of the church of the Laodiceans write;These things saith the Amen, the faithful and true witness, thebeginning of the creation of God; 

{3:15} I know thy works, that thouart neither cold nor hot: I would thou wert cold or hot. 

{3:16} So thenbecause thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spue theeout of my mouth. 

{3:17} Because thou sayest, I am rich, and increasedwith goods, and have need of nothing; and knowest not that thou artwretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked: 

{3:18} Icounsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire, that thou mayest berich; and white raiment, that thou mayest be clothed, and [that] theshame of thy nakedness do not appear; and anoint thine eyes witheyesalve, that thou mayest see. 

{3:19} As many as I love, I rebuke andchasten: be zealous therefore, and repent. 

{3:20} Behold, I stand atthe door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, Iwill come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me. 

{3:21} Tohim that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as Ialso overcame, and am set down with my Father in his throne. 

{3:22} Hethat hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches.   

{4:1} After this I looked, and, behold, a door [was] opened inheaven: and the first voice which I heard [was] as it were of a trumpettalking with me; which said, Come up hither, and I will shew theethings which must be hereafter. 

{4:2} And immediately I was in thespirit: and, behold, a throne was set in heaven, and [one] sat on thethrone. 

{4:3} And he that sat was to look upon like a jasper and asardine stone: and [there was] a rainbow round about the throne, insight like unto an emerald. 

{4:4} And round about the throne [were]four and twenty seats: and upon the seats I saw four and twenty elderssitting, clothed in white raiment; and they had on their heads crownsof gold. 

{4:5} And out of the throne proceeded lightnings andthunderings and voices: and [there were] seven lamps of fire burningbefore the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God. 

{4:6} And beforethe throne [there was] a sea of glass like unto crystal: and in themidst of the throne, and round about the throne, [were] four beastsfull of eyes before and behind. 

{4:7} And the first beast [was] like alion, and the second beast like a calf, and the third beast had a faceas a man, and the fourth beast [was] like a flying eagle. 

{4:8} And thefour beasts had each of them six wings about [him;] and [they were]full of eyes within: and they rest not day and night, saying, Holy,holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, which was, and is, and is to come. 

{4:9}And when those beasts give glory and honour and thanks to him that saton the throne, who liveth for ever and ever, 

{4:10} The four and twentyelders fall down before him that sat on the throne, and worship himthat liveth for ever and ever, and cast their crowns before the throne,saying, 

{4:11} Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honour andpower: for thou hast created all things, and for thy pleasure they areand were created.   

{5:1} And I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne abook written within and on the backside, sealed with seven seals. 

{5:2}And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, Who is worthyto open the book, and to loose the seals thereof? 

{5:3} And no man inheaven, nor in earth, neither under the earth, was able to open thebook, neither to look thereon. 

{5:4} And I wept much, because no manwas found worthy to open and to read the book, neither to look thereon.

{5:5} And one of the elders saith unto me, Weep not: behold, the Lionof the tribe of Juda, the Root of David, hath prevailed to open thebook, and to loose the seven seals thereof. 

{5:6} And I beheld, and,lo, in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts, and in the midstof the elders, stood a Lamb as it had been slain, having seven hornsand seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into allthe earth. 

{5:7} And he came and took the book out of the right hand ofhim that sat upon the throne. 

{5:8} And when he had taken the book, thefour beasts and four [and] twenty elders fell down before the Lamb,having every one of them harps, and golden vials full of odours, whichare the prayers of saints. 

{5:9} And they sung a new song, saying, Thouart worthy to take the book, and to open the seals thereof: for thouwast slain, and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood out of everykindred, and tongue, and people, and nation; 

{5:10} And hast made usunto our God kings and priests: and we shall reign on the earth. 

{5:11}And I beheld, and I heard the voice of many angels round about thethrone and the beasts and the elders: and the number of them was tenthousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands; 

{5:12} Sayingwith a loud voice, Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power,and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honour, and glory, andblessing. 

{5:13} And every creature which is in heaven, and on theearth, and under the earth, and such as are in the sea, and all thatare in them, heard I saying, Blessing, and honour, and glory, andpower, [be] unto him that sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lambfor ever and ever. 

{5:14} And the four beasts said, Amen. And the four[and] twenty elders fell down and worshipped him that liveth for everand ever.   

{6:1} And I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seals, and I heard,as it were the noise of thunder, one of the four beasts saying, Comeand see. 

{6:2} And I saw, and behold a white horse: and he that sat onhim had a bow; and a crown was given unto him: and he went forthconquering, and to conquer. 

{6:3} And when he had opened the secondseal, I heard the second beast say, Come and see. 

{6:4} And there wentout another horse [that was] red: and [power] was given to him that satthereon to take peace from the earth, and that they should kill oneanother: and there was given unto him a great sword. 

{6:5} And when hehad opened the third seal, I heard the third beast say, Come and see.And I beheld, and lo a black horse; and he that sat on him had a pairof balances in his hand. 

{6:6} And I heard a voice in the midst of thefour beasts say, A measure of wheat for a penny, and three measures ofbarley for a penny; and [see] thou hurt not the oil and the wine. 

{6:7}And when he had opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourthbeast say, Come and see. 

{6:8} And I looked, and behold a pale horse:and his name that sat on him was Death, and Hell followed with him. Andpower was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth, to killwith sword, and with hunger, and with death, and with the beasts of theearth. 

{6:9} And when he had opened the fifth seal, I saw under thealtar the souls of them that were slain for the word of God, and forthe testimony which they held: 

{6:10} And they cried with a loud voice,saying, How long, O Lord, holy and true, dost thou not judge and avengeour blood on them that dwell on the earth? 

{6:11} And white robes weregiven unto every one of them; and it was said unto them, that theyshould rest yet for a little season, until their fellowservants alsoand their brethren, that should be killed as they [were,] should befulfilled. 

{6:12} And I beheld when he had opened the sixth seal, and,lo, there was a great earthquake; and the sun became black as sackclothof hair, and the moon became as blood; 

{6:13} And the stars of heavenfell unto the earth, even as a fig tree casteth her untimely figs, whenshe is shaken of a mighty wind. 

{6:14} And the heaven departed as ascroll when it is rolled together; and every mountain and island weremoved out of their places. 

{6:15} And the kings of the earth, and thegreat men, and the rich men, and the chief captains, and the mightymen, and every bondman, and every free man, hid themselves in the densand in the rocks of the mountains; 

{6:16} And said to the mountains androcks, Fall on us, and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on thethrone, and from the wrath of the Lamb: 

{6:17} For the great day of hiswrath is come; and who shall be able to stand?   

{7:1} And after these things I saw four angels standing on the fourcorners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth, that thewind should not blow on the earth, nor on the sea, nor on any tree.

{7:2} And I saw another angel ascending from the east, having the sealof the living God: and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels,to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea, 

{7:3} Saying, Hurtnot the earth, neither the sea, nor the trees, till we have sealed theservants of our God in their foreheads. 

{7:4} And I heard the number ofthem which were sealed: [and there were] sealed an hundred [and] forty[and] four thousand of all the tribes of the children of Israel. 

{7:5}Of the tribe of Juda [were] sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe ofReuben [were] sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Gad [were] sealedtwelve thousand. 

{7:6} Of the tribe of Aser [were] sealed twelvethousand. Of the tribe of Nepthalim [were] sealed twelve thousand. Ofthe tribe of Manasses [were] sealed twelve thousand. 

{7:7} Of the tribeof Simeon [were] sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Levi [were]sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Issachar [were] sealed twelvethousand. 

{7:8} Of the tribe of Zabulon [were] sealed twelve thousand.Of the tribe of Joseph [were] sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe ofBenjamin [were] sealed twelve thousand. 

{7:9} After this I beheld, and,lo, a great multitude, which no man could number, of all nations, andkindreds, and people, and tongues, stood before the throne, and beforethe Lamb, clothed with white robes, and palms in their hands; 

{7:10}And cried with a loud voice, saying, Salvation to our God which sittethupon the throne, and unto the Lamb. 

{7:11} And all the angels stoodround about the throne, and [about] the elders and the four beasts, andfell before the throne on their faces, and worshipped God, 

{7:12}Saying, Amen: Blessing, and glory, and wisdom, and thanksgiving, andhonour, and power, and might, [be] unto our God for ever and ever.Amen. 

{7:13} And one of the elders answered, saying unto me, What arethese which are arrayed in white robes? and whence came they? 

{7:14}And I said unto him, Sir, thou knowest. And he said to me, These arethey which came out of great tribulation, and have washed their robes,and made them white in the blood of the Lamb. 

{7:15} Therefore are theybefore the throne of God, and serve him day and night in his temple:and he that sitteth on the throne shall dwell among them. 

{7:16} Theyshall hunger no more, neither thirst any more; neither shall the sunlight on them, nor any heat. 

{7:17} For the Lamb which is in the midstof the throne shall feed them, and shall lead them unto livingfountains of waters: and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes.   

{8:1} And when he had opened the seventh seal, there was silence inheaven about the space of half an hour. 

{8:2} And I saw the sevenangels which stood before God; and to them were given seven trumpets.

{8:3} And another angel came and stood at the altar, having a goldencenser; and there was given unto him much incense, that he should offer[it] with the prayers of all saints upon the golden altar which wasbefore the throne. 

{8:4} And the smoke of the incense, [which came]with the prayers of the saints, ascended up before God out of theangel's hand. 

{8:5} And the angel took the censer, and filled it withfire of the altar, and cast [it] into the earth: and there were voices,and thunderings, and lightnings, and an earthquake. 

{8:6} And the sevenangels which had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound.   

{8:7} The first angel sounded, and there followed hail and firemingled with blood, and they were cast upon the earth: and the thirdpart of trees was burnt up, and all green grass was burnt up. 

{8:8} Andthe second angel sounded, and as it were a great mountain burning withfire was cast into the sea: and the third part of the sea became blood;

{8:9} And the third part of the creatures which were in the sea, andhad life, died; and the third part of the ships were destroyed. 

{8:10}And the third angel sounded, and there fell a great star from heaven,burning as it were a lamp, and it fell upon the third part of therivers, and upon the fountains of waters; 

{8:11} And the name of thestar is called Wormwood: and the third part of the waters becamewormwood; and many men died of the waters, because they were madebitter. 

{8:12} And the fourth angel sounded, and the third part of thesun was smitten, and the third part of the moon, and the third part ofthe stars; so as the third part of them was darkened, and the day shonenot for a third part of it, and the night likewise.   

{8:13} And I beheld, and heard an angel flying through the midst ofheaven, saying with a loud voice, Woe, woe, woe, to the inhabiters ofthe earth by reason of the other voices of the trumpet of the threeangels, which are yet to sound!   

{9:1} And the fifth angel sounded, and I saw a star fall from heavenunto the earth: and to him was given the key of the bottomless pit.

{9:2} And he opened the bottomless pit; and there arose a smoke out ofthe pit, as the smoke of a great furnace; and the sun and the air weredarkened by reason of the smoke of the pit. 

{9:3} And there came out ofthe smoke locusts upon the earth: and unto them was given power, as thescorpions of the earth have power. 

{9:4} And it was commanded them thatthey should not hurt the grass of the earth, neither any green thing,neither any tree; but only those men which have not the seal of God intheir foreheads. 

{9:5} And to them it was given that they should notkill them, but that they should be tormented five months: and theirtorment [was] as the torment of a scorpion, when he striketh a man.

{9:6} And in those days shall men seek death, and shall not find it;and shall desire to die, and death shall flee from them. 

{9:7} And theshapes of the locusts [were] like unto horses prepared unto battle; andon their heads [were] as it were crowns like gold, and their faces[were] as the faces of men. 

{9:8} And they had hair as the hair ofwomen, and their teeth were as [the teeth] of lions. 

{9:9} And they hadbreastplates, as it were breastplates of iron; and the sound of theirwings [was] as the sound of chariots of many horses running to battle.

{9:10} And they had tails like unto scorpions, and there were stings intheir tails: and their power [was] to hurt men five months. 

{9:11} Andthey had a king over them, [which is] the angel of the bottomless pit,whose name in the Hebrew tongue [is] Abaddon, but in the Greek tonguehath [his] name Apollyon. 

{9:12} One woe is past; [and,] behold, therecome two woes more hereafter.   

{9:13} And the sixth angel sounded, and I heard a voice from thefour horns of the golden altar which is before God, 

{9:14} Saying tothe sixth angel which had the trumpet, Loose the four angels which arebound in the great river Euphrates. 

{9:15} And the four angels wereloosed, which were prepared for an hour, and a day, and a month, and ayear, for to slay the third part of men. 

{9:16} And the number of thearmy of the horsemen [were] two hundred thousand thousand: and I heardthe number of them. 

{9:17} And thus I saw the horses in the vision, andthem that sat on them, having breastplates of fire, and of jacinth, andbrimstone: and the heads of the horses [were] as the heads of lions;and out of their mouths issued fire and smoke and brimstone. 

{9:18} Bythese three was the third part of men killed, by the fire, and by thesmoke, and by the brimstone, which issued out of their mouths. 

{9:19}For their power is in their mouth, and in their tails: for their tails[were] like unto serpents, and had heads, and with them they do hurt.

{9:20} And the rest of the men which were not killed by these plaguesyet repented not of the works of their hands, that they should notworship devils, and idols of gold, and silver, and brass, and stone,and of wood: which neither can see, nor hear, nor walk: 

{9:21} Neitherrepented they of their murders, nor of their sorceries, nor of theirfornication, nor of their thefts.   

{10:1} And I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven, clothedwith a cloud: and a rainbow [was] upon his head, and his face [was] asit were the sun, and his feet as pillars of fire: 

{10:2} And he had inhis hand a little book open: and he set his right foot upon the sea,and [his] left [foot] on the earth, 

{10:3} And cried with a loud voice,as [when] a lion roareth: and when he had cried, seven thunders utteredtheir voices. 

{10:4} And when the seven thunders had uttered theirvoices, I was about to write: and I heard a voice from heaven sayingunto me, Seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered, andwrite them not. 

{10:5} And the angel which I saw stand upon the sea andupon the earth lifted up his hand to heaven, 

{10:6} And sware by himthat liveth for ever and ever, who created heaven, and the things thattherein are, and the earth, and the things that therein are, and thesea, and the things which are therein, that there should be time nolonger: 

{10:7} But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, whenhe shall begin to sound, the mystery of God should be finished, as hehath declared to his servants the prophets. 

{10:8} And the voice whichI heard from heaven spake unto me again, and said, Go [and] take thelittle book which is open in the hand of the angel which standeth uponthe sea and upon the earth. 

{10:9} And I went unto the angel, and saidunto him, Give me the little book. And he said unto me, Take [it,] andeat it up; and it shall make thy belly bitter, but it shall be in thymouth sweet as honey. 

{10:10} And I took the little book out of theangel's hand, and ate it up; and it was in my mouth sweet as honey: andas soon as I had eaten it, my belly was bitter. 

{10:11} And he saidunto me, Thou must prophesy again before many peoples, and nations, andtongues, and kings.   

{11:1} And there was given me a reed like unto a rod: and the angelstood, saying, Rise, and measure the temple of God, and the altar, andthem that worship therein. 

{11:2} But the court which is without thetemple leave out, and measure it not; for it is given unto theGentiles: and the holy city shall they tread under foot forty [and] twomonths. 

{11:3} And I will give [power] unto my two witnesses, and theyshall prophesy a thousand two hundred [and] threescore days, clothed insackcloth. 

{11:4} These are the two olive trees, and the twocandlesticks standing before the God of the earth. 

{11:5} And if anyman will hurt them, fire proceedeth out of their mouth, and devoureththeir enemies: and if any man will hurt them, he must in this manner bekilled. 

{11:6} These have power to shut heaven, that it rain not in thedays of their prophecy: and have power over waters to turn them toblood, and to smite the earth with all plagues, as often as they will.

{11:7} And when they shall have finished their testimony, the beastthat ascendeth out of the bottomless pit shall make war against them,and shall overcome them, and kill them. 

{11:8} And their dead bodies[shall lie] in the street of the great city, which spiritually iscalled Sodom and Egypt, where also our Lord was crucified. 

{11:9} Andthey of the people and kindreds and tongues and nations shall see theirdead bodies three days and an half, and shall not suffer their deadbodies to be put in graves. 

{11:10} And they that dwell upon the earthshall rejoice over them, and make merry, and shall send gifts one toanother; because these two prophets tormented them that dwelt on theearth. 

{11:11} And after three days and an half the Spirit of life fromGod entered into them, and they stood upon their feet; and great fearfell upon them which saw them. 

{11:12} And they heard a great voicefrom heaven saying unto them, Come up hither. And they ascended up toheaven in a cloud; and their enemies beheld them. 

{11:13} And the samehour was there a great earthquake, and the tenth part of the city fell,and in the earthquake were slain of men seven thousand: and the remnantwere affrighted, and gave glory to the God of heaven. 

{11:14} Thesecond woe is past; [and,] behold, the third woe cometh quickly.

{11:15} And the seventh angel sounded; and there were great voices inheaven, saying, The kingdoms of this world are become [the kingdoms] ofour Lord, and of his Christ; and he shall reign for ever and ever.

{11:16} And the four and twenty elders, which sat before God on theirseats, fell upon their faces, and worshipped God, 

{11:17} Saying, Wegive thee thanks, O Lord God Almighty, which art, and wast, and art tocome; because thou hast taken to thee thy great power, and hastreigned. 

{11:18} And the nations were angry, and thy wrath is come, andthe time of the dead, that they should be judged, and that thoushouldest give reward unto thy servants the prophets, and to thesaints, and them that fear thy name, small and great; and shouldestdestroy them which destroy the earth. 

{11:19} And the temple of God wasopened in heaven, and there was seen in his temple the ark of histestament: and there were lightnings, and voices, and thunderings, andan earthquake, and great hail.   

{12:1} And there appeared a great wonder in heaven; a woman clothedwith the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown oftwelve stars: 

{12:2} And she being with child cried, travailing inbirth, and pained to be delivered. 

{12:3} And there appeared anotherwonder in heaven; and behold a great red dragon, having seven heads andten horns, and seven crowns upon his heads. 

{12:4} And his tail drewthe third part of the stars of heaven, and did cast them to the earth:and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered,for to devour her child as soon as it was born. 

{12:5} And she broughtforth a man child, who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron: andher child was caught up unto God, and [to] his throne. 

{12:6} And thewoman fled into the wilderness, where she hath a place prepared of God,that they should feed her there a thousand two hundred [and] threescoredays. 

{12:7} And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels foughtagainst the dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels, 

{12:8} Andprevailed not; neither was their place found any more in heaven. 

{12:9}And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil,and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into theearth, and his angels were cast out with him. 

{12:10} And I heard aloud voice saying in heaven, Now is come salvation, and strength, andthe kingdom of our God, and the power of his Christ: for the accuser ofour brethren is cast down, which accused them before our God day andnight. 

{12:11} And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and bythe word of their testimony; and they loved not their lives unto thedeath. 

{12:12} Therefore rejoice, [ye] heavens, and ye that dwell inthem. Woe to the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea! for the devilis come down unto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth that hehath but a short time. 

{12:13} And when the dragon saw that he was castunto the earth, he persecuted the woman which brought forth the man[child. ]

{12:14} And to the woman were given two wings of a greateagle, that she might fly into the wilderness, into her place, whereshe is nourished for a time, and times, and half a time, from the faceof the serpent. 

{12:15} And the serpent cast out of his mouth water asa flood after the woman, that he might cause her to be carried away ofthe flood. 

{12:16} And the earth helped the woman, and the earth openedher mouth, and swallowed up the flood which the dragon cast out of hismouth. 

{12:17} And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went tomake war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments ofGod, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ.   

{13:1} And I stood upon the sand of the sea, and saw a beast rise upout of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his hornsten crowns, and upon his heads the name of blasphemy. 

{13:2} And thebeast which I saw was like unto a leopard, and his feet were as [thefeet] of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a lion: and the dragongave him his power, and his seat, and great authority. 

{13:3} And I sawone of his heads as it were wounded to death; and his deadly wound washealed: and all the world wondered after the beast. 

{13:4} And theyworshipped the dragon which gave power unto the beast: and theyworshipped the beast, saying, Who [is] like unto the beast? who is ableto make war with him? 

{13:5} And there was given unto him a mouthspeaking great things and blasphemies; and power was given unto him tocontinue forty [and] two months. 

{13:6} And he opened his mouth inblasphemy against God, to blaspheme his name, and his tabernacle, andthem that dwell in heaven. 

{13:7} And it was given unto him to make warwith the saints, and to overcome them: and power was given him over allkindreds, and tongues, and nations. 

{13:8} And all that dwell upon theearth shall worship him, whose names are not written in the book oflife of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world. 

{13:9} If anyman have an ear, let him hear. 

{13:10} He that leadeth into captivityshall go into captivity: he that killeth with the sword must be killedwith the sword. Here is the patience and the faith of the saints.

{13:11} And I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth; and hehad two horns like a lamb, and he spake as a dragon. 

{13:12} And heexerciseth all the power of the first beast before him, and causeth theearth and them which dwell therein to worship the first beast, whosedeadly wound was healed. 

{13:13} And he doeth great wonders, so that hemaketh fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men,

{13:14} And deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by [the means of]those miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the beast;saying to them that dwell on the earth, that they should make an imageto the beast, which had the wound by a sword, and did live. 

{13:15} Andhe had power to give life unto the image of the beast, that the imageof the beast should both speak, and cause that as many as would notworship the image of the beast should be killed. 

{13:16} And he causethall, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive amark in their right hand, or in their foreheads: 

{13:17} And that noman might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of thebeast, or the number of his name. 

{13:18} Here is wisdom. Let him thathath understanding count the number of the beast: for it is the numberof a man; and his number [is] Six hundred threescore [and] six.   

{14:1} And I looked, and, lo, a Lamb stood on the mount Sion, andwith him an hundred forty [and] four thousand, having his Father's namewritten in their foreheads. 

{14:2} And I heard a voice from heaven, asthe voice of many waters, and as the voice of a great thunder: and Iheard the voice of harpers harping with their harps: 

{14:3} And theysung as it were a new song before the throne, and before the fourbeasts, and the elders: and no man could learn that song but thehundred [and] forty [and] four thousand, which were redeemed from theearth. 

{14:4} These are they which were not defiled with women; forthey are virgins. These are they which follow the Lamb whithersoever hegoeth. These were redeemed from among men, [being] the firstfruits untoGod and to the Lamb. 

{14:5} And in their mouth was found no guile: forthey are without fault before the throne of God.   

{14:6} And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, havingthe everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, andto every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people, 

{14:7} Sayingwith a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of hisjudgment is come: and worship him that made heaven, and earth, and thesea, and the fountains of waters. 

{14:8} And there followed anotherangel, saying, Babylon is fallen, is fallen, that great city, becauseshe made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication.

{14:9} And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, Ifany man worship the beast and his image, and receive [his] mark in hisforehead, or in his hand, 

{14:10} The same shall drink of the wine ofthe wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the cup ofhis indignation; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone inthe presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb:

{14:11} And the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever:and they have no rest day nor night, who worship the beast and hisimage, and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name. 

{14:12} Here isthe patience of the saints: here [are] they that keep the commandmentsof God, and the faith of Jesus. 

{14:13} And I heard a voice from heavensaying unto me, Write, Blessed [are] the dead which die in the Lordfrom henceforth: Yea, saith the Spirit, that they may rest from theirlabours; and their works do follow them.   

{14:14} And I looked, and behold a white cloud, and upon the cloud[one] sat like unto the Son of man, having on his head a golden crown,and in his hand a sharp sickle. 

{14:15} And another angel came out ofthe temple, crying with a loud voice to him that sat on the cloud,Thrust in thy sickle, and reap: for the time is come for thee to reap;for the harvest of the earth is ripe. 

{14:16} And he that sat on thecloud thrust in his sickle on the earth; and the earth was reaped.

{14:17} And another angel came out of the temple which is in heaven, healso having a sharp sickle. 

{14:18} And another angel came out from thealtar, which had power over fire; and cried with a loud cry to him thathad the sharp sickle, saying, Thrust in thy sharp sickle, and gatherthe clusters of the vine of the earth; for her grapes are fully ripe.

{14:19} And the angel thrust in his sickle into the earth, and gatheredthe vine of the earth, and cast [it] into the great winepress of thewrath of God. 

{14:20} And the winepress was trodden without the city,and blood came out of the winepress, even unto the horse bridles, bythe space of a thousand [and] six hundred furlongs.   

{15:1} And I saw another sign in heaven, great and marvellous, sevenangels having the seven last plagues; for in them is filled up thewrath of God. 

{15:2} And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled withfire: and them that had gotten the victory over the beast, and over hisimage, and over his mark, [and] over the number of his name, stand onthe sea of glass, having the harps of God. 

{15:3} And they sing thesong of Moses the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying,Great and marvellous [are] thy works, Lord God Almighty; just and true[are] thy ways, thou King of saints. 

{15:4} Who shall not fear thee, OLord, and glorify thy name? for [thou] only [art] holy: for all nationsshall come and worship before thee; for thy judgments are mademanifest. 

{15:5} And after that I looked, and, behold, the temple ofthe tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened: 

{15:6} And theseven angels came out of the temple, having the seven plagues, clothedin pure and white linen, and having their breasts girded with goldengirdles. 

{15:7} And one of the four beasts gave unto the seven angelsseven golden vials full of the wrath of God, who liveth for ever andever. 

{15:8} And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory ofGod, and from his power; and no man was able to enter into the temple,till the seven plagues of the seven angels were fulfilled.   

{16:1} And I heard a great voice out of the temple saying to theseven angels, Go your ways, and pour out the vials of the wrath of Godupon the earth. 

{16:2} And the first went, and poured out his vial uponthe earth; and there fell a noisome and grievous sore upon the menwhich had the mark of the beast, and [upon] them which worshipped hisimage. 

{16:3} And the second angel poured out his vial upon the sea;and it became as the blood of a dead [man:] and every living soul diedin the sea. 

{16:4} And the third angel poured out his vial upon therivers and fountains of waters; and they became blood. 

{16:5} And Iheard the angel of the waters say, Thou art righteous, O Lord, whichart, and wast, and shalt be, because thou hast judged thus. 

{16:6} Forthey have shed the blood of saints and prophets, and thou hast giventhem blood to drink; for they are worthy. 

{16:7} And I heard anotherout of the altar say, Even so, Lord God Almighty, true and righteous[are] thy judgments. 

{16:8} And the fourth angel poured out his vialupon the sun; and power was given unto him to scorch men with fire.

{16:9} And men were scorched with great heat, and blasphemed the nameof God, which hath power over these plagues: and they repented not togive him glory. 

{16:10} And the fifth angel poured out his vial uponthe seat of the beast; and his kingdom was full of darkness; and theygnawed their tongues for pain, 

{16:11} And blasphemed the God of heavenbecause of their pains and their sores, and repented not of theirdeeds. 

{16:12} And the sixth angel poured out his vial upon the greatriver Euphrates; and the water thereof was dried up, that the way ofthe kings of the east might be prepared. 

{16:13} And I saw threeunclean spirits like frogs [come] out of the mouth of the dragon, andout of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the falseprophet. 

{16:14} For they are the spirits of devils, working miracles,[which] go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world, togather them to the battle of that great day of God Almighty. 

{16:15}Behold, I come as a thief. Blessed [is] he that watcheth, and keepethhis garments, lest he walk naked, and they see his shame. 

{16:16} Andhe gathered them together into a place called in the Hebrew tongueArmageddon. 

{16:17} And the seventh angel poured out his vial into theair; and there came a great voice out of the temple of heaven, from thethrone, saying, It is done. 

{16:18} And there were voices, andthunders, and lightnings; and there was a great earthquake, such as wasnot since men were upon the earth, so mighty an earthquake, [and] sogreat. 

{16:19} And the great city was divided into three parts, and thecities of the nations fell: and great Babylon came in remembrancebefore God, to give unto her the cup of the wine of the fierceness ofhis wrath. 

{16:20} And every island fled away, and the mountains werenot found. 

{16:21} And there fell upon men a great hail out of heaven,[every stone] about the weight of a talent: and men blasphemed Godbecause of the plague of the hail; for the plague thereof was exceedinggreat.   

{17:1} And there came one of the seven angels which had the sevenvials, and talked with me, saying unto me, Come hither; I will shewunto thee the judgment of the great whore that sitteth upon manywaters: 

{17:2} With whom the kings of the earth have committedfornication, and the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk withthe wine of her fornication. 

{17:3} So he carried me away in the spiritinto the wilderness: and I saw a woman sit upon a scarlet colouredbeast, full of names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns.

{17:4} And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet colour, anddecked with gold and precious stones and pearls, having a golden cup inher hand full of abominations and filthiness of her fornication: 

{17:5}And upon her forehead [was] a name written, MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT,THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH. 

{17:6} And I sawthe woman drunken with the blood of the saints, and with the blood ofthe martyrs of Jesus: and when I saw her, I wondered with greatadmiration. 

{17:7} And the angel said unto me, Wherefore didst thoumarvel? I will tell thee the mystery of the woman, and of the beastthat carrieth her, which hath the seven heads and ten horns. 

{17:8} Thebeast that thou sawest was, and is not; and shall ascend out of thebottomless pit, and go into perdition: and they that dwell on the earthshall wonder, whose names were not written in the book of life from thefoundation of the world, when they behold the beast that was, and isnot, and yet is. 

{17:9} And here [is] the mind which hath wisdom. Theseven heads are seven mountains, on which the woman sitteth. 

{17:10}And there are seven kings: five are fallen, and one is, [and] the otheris not yet come; and when he cometh, he must continue a short space.

{17:11} And the beast that was, and is not, even he is the eighth, andis of the seven, and goeth into perdition. 

{17:12} And the ten hornswhich thou sawest are ten kings, which have received no kingdom as yet;but receive power as kings one hour with the beast. 

{17:13} These haveone mind, and shall give their power and strength unto the beast.

{17:14} These shall make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcomethem: for he is Lord of lords, and King of kings: and they that arewith him [are] called, and chosen, and faithful. 

{17:15} And he saithunto me, The waters which thou sawest, where the whore sitteth, arepeoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues. 

{17:16} And the tenhorns which thou sawest upon the beast, these shall hate the whore, andshall make her desolate and naked, and shall eat her flesh, and burnher with fire. 

{17:17} For God hath put in their hearts to fulfil hiswill, and to agree, and give their kingdom unto the beast, until thewords of God shall be fulfilled. 

{17:18} And the woman which thousawest is that great city, which reigneth over the kings of the earth.   

{18:1} And after these things I saw another angel come down fromheaven, having great power; and the earth was lightened with his glory.

{18:2} And he cried mightily with a strong voice, saying, Babylon thegreat is fallen, is fallen, and is become the habitation of devils, andthe hold of every foul spirit, and a cage of every unclean and hatefulbird. 

{18:3} For all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of herfornication, and the kings of the earth have committed fornication withher, and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through theabundance of her delicacies. 

{18:4} And I heard another voice fromheaven, saying, Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers ofher sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues. 

{18:5} For her sinshave reached unto heaven, and God hath remembered her iniquities.

{18:6} Reward her even as she rewarded you, and double unto her doubleaccording to her works: in the cup which she hath filled fill to herdouble. 

{18:7} How much she hath glorified herself, and liveddeliciously, so much torment and sorrow give her: for she saith in herheart, I sit a queen, and am no widow, and shall see no sorrow. 

{18:8}Therefore shall her plagues come in one day, death, and mourning, andfamine; and she shall be utterly burned with fire: for strong [is] theLord God who judgeth her. 

{18:9} And the kings of the earth, who havecommitted fornication and lived deliciously with her, shall bewail her,and lament for her, when they shall see the smoke of her burning,

{18:10} Standing afar off for the fear of her torment, saying, Alas,alas, that great city Babylon, that mighty city! for in one hour is thyjudgment come. 

{18:11} And the merchants of the earth shall weep andmourn over her; for no man buyeth their merchandise any more: 

{18:12}The merchandise of gold, and silver, and precious stones, and ofpearls, and fine linen, and purple, and silk, and scarlet, and allthyine wood, and all manner vessels of ivory, and all manner vessels ofmost precious wood, and of brass, and iron, and marble, 

{18:13} Andcinnamon, and odours, and ointments, and frankincense, and wine, andoil, and fine flour, and wheat, and beasts, and sheep, and horses, andchariots, and slaves, and souls of men. 

{18:14} And the fruits that thysoul lusted after are departed from thee, and all things which weredainty and goodly are departed from thee, and thou shalt find them nomore at all. 

{18:15} The merchants of these things, which were maderich by her, shall stand afar off for the fear of her torment, weepingand wailing, 

{18:16} And saying, Alas, alas, that great city, that wasclothed in fine linen, and purple, and scarlet, and decked with gold,and precious stones, and pearls! 

{18:17} For in one hour so greatriches is come to nought. And every shipmaster, and all the company inships, and sailors, and as many as trade by sea, stood afar off,

{18:18} And cried when they saw the smoke of her burning, saying, What[city is] like unto this great city! 

{18:19} And they cast dust ontheir heads, and cried, weeping and wailing, saying, Alas, alas, thatgreat city, wherein were made rich all that had ships in the sea byreason of her costliness! for in one hour is she made desolate. 

{18:20}Rejoice over her, [thou] heaven, and [ye] holy apostles and prophets;for God hath avenged you on her. 

{18:21} And a mighty angel took up astone like a great millstone, and cast [it] into the sea, saying, Thuswith violence shall that great city Babylon be thrown down, and shallbe found no more at all. 

{18:22} And the voice of harpers, andmusicians, and of pipers, and trumpeters, shall be heard no more at allin thee; and no craftsman, of whatsoever craft [he be,] shall be foundany more in thee; and the sound of a millstone shall be heard no moreat all in thee; 

{18:23} And the light of a candle shall shine no moreat all in thee; and the voice of the bridegroom and of the bride shallbe heard no more at all in thee: for thy merchants were the great menof the earth; for by thy sorceries were all nations deceived. 

{18:24}And in her was found the blood of prophets, and of saints, and of allthat were slain upon the earth.   

{19:1} And after these things I heard a great voice of much peoplein heaven, saying, Alleluia; Salvation, and glory, and honour, andpower, unto the Lord our God: 

{19:2} For true and righteous [are] hisjudgments: for he hath judged the great whore, which did corrupt theearth with her fornication, and hath avenged the blood of his servantsat her hand. 

{19:3} And again they said, Alleluia. And her smoke roseup for ever and ever. 

{19:4} And the four and twenty elders and thefour beasts fell down and worshipped God that sat on the throne,saying, Amen; Alleluia. 

{19:5} And a voice came out of the throne,saying, Praise our God, all ye his servants, and ye that fear him, bothsmall and great. 

{19:6} And I heard as it were the voice of a greatmultitude, and as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of mightythunderings, saying, Alleluia: for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth.

{19:7} Let us be glad and rejoice, and give honour to him: for themarriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife hath made herself ready.

{19:8} And to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen,clean and white: for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints.

{19:9} And he saith unto me, Write, Blessed [are] they which are calledunto the marriage supper of the Lamb. And he saith unto me, These arethe true sayings of God. 

{19:10} And I fell at his feet to worship him.And he said unto me, See [thou do it] not: I am thy fellowservant, andof thy brethren that have the testimony of Jesus: worship God: for thetestimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy. 

{19:11} And I saw heavenopened, and behold a white horse; and he that sat upon him [was] calledFaithful and True, and in righteousness he doth judge and make war.

{19:12} His eyes [were] as a flame of fire, and on his head [were] manycrowns; and he had a name written, that no man knew, but he himself.

{19:13} And he [was] clothed with a vesture dipped in blood: and hisname is called The Word of God. 

{19:14} And the armies [which were] inheaven followed him upon white horses, clothed in fine linen, white andclean. 

{19:15} And out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword, that with ithe should smite the nations: and he shall rule them with a rod of iron:and he treadeth the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of AlmightyGod. 

{19:16} And he hath on [his] vesture and on his thigh a namewritten, KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS.   

{19:17} And I saw an angel standing in the sun; and he cried with aloud voice, saying to all the fowls that fly in the midst of heaven,Come and gather yourselves together unto the supper of the great God;

{19:18} That ye may eat the flesh of kings, and the flesh of captains,and the flesh of mighty men, and the flesh of horses, and of them thatsit on them, and the flesh of all [men, both] free and bond, both smalland great. 

{19:19} And I saw the beast, and the kings of the earth, andtheir armies, gathered together to make war against him that sat on thehorse, and against his army. 

{19:20} And the beast was taken, and withhim the false prophet that wrought miracles before him, with which hedeceived them that had received the mark of the beast, and them thatworshipped his image. These both were cast alive into a lake of fireburning with brimstone. 

{19:21} And the remnant were slain with thesword of him that sat upon the horse, which [sword] proceeded out ofhis mouth: and all the fowls were filled with their flesh.   

{20:1} And I saw an angel come down from heaven, having the key ofthe bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand. 

{20:2} And he laidhold on the dragon, that old serpent, which is the Devil, and Satan,and bound him a thousand years, 

{20:3} And cast him into the bottomlesspit, and shut him up, and set a seal upon him, that he should deceivethe nations no more, till the thousand years should be fulfilled: andafter that he must be loosed a little season. 

{20:4} And I saw thrones,and they sat upon them, and judgment was given unto them: and [I saw]the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and forthe word of God, and which had not worshipped the beast, neither hisimage, neither had received [his] mark upon their foreheads, or intheir hands; and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years.

{20:5} But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousandyears were finished. This [is] the first resurrection. 

{20:6} Blessedand holy [is] he that hath part in the first resurrection: on such thesecond death hath no power, but they shall be priests of God and ofChrist, and shall reign with him a thousand years. 

{20:7} And when thethousand years are expired, Satan shall be loosed out of his prison,

{20:8} And shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the fourquarters of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together tobattle: the number of whom [is] as the sand of the sea. 

{20:9} And theywent up on the breadth of the earth, and compassed the camp of thesaints about, and the beloved city: and fire came down from God out ofheaven, and devoured them. 

{20:10} And the devil that deceived them wascast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the falseprophet [are,] and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever.   

{20:11} And I saw a great white throne, and him that sat on it, fromwhose face the earth and the heaven fled away; and there was found noplace for them. 

{20:12} And I saw the dead, small and great, standbefore God; and the books were opened: and another book was opened,which is [the book] of life: and the dead were judged out of thosethings which were written in the books, according to their works.

{20:13} And the sea gave up the dead which were in it; and death andhell delivered up the dead which were in them: and they were judgedevery man according to their works. 

{20:14} And death and hell werecast into the lake of fire. This is the second death. 

{20:15} Andwhosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into thelake of fire.   

{21:1} And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heavenand the first earth were passed away; and there was no more sea. 

{21:2}And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God outof heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. 

{21:3} And Iheard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God[is] with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be hispeople, and God himself shall be with them, [and be] their God. 

{21:4}And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall beno more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be anymore pain: for the former things are passed away. 

{21:5} And he thatsat upon the throne said, Behold, I make all things new. And he saidunto me, Write: for these words are true and faithful. 

{21:6} And hesaid unto me, It is done. I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and theend. I will give unto him that is athirst of the fountain of the waterof life freely. 

{21:7} He that overcometh shall inherit all things; andI will be his God, and he shall be my son. 

{21:8} But the fearful, andunbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, andsorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in thelake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.   

{21:9} And there came unto me one of the seven angels which had theseven vials full of the seven last plagues, and talked with me, saying,Come hither, I will shew thee the bride, the Lamb's wife. 

{21:10} Andhe carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain, andshewed me that great city, the holy Jerusalem, descending out of heavenfrom God, 

{21:11} Having the glory of God: and her light [was] likeunto a stone most precious, even like a jasper stone, clear as crystal;

{21:12} And had a wall great and high, [and] had twelve gates, and atthe gates twelve angels, and names written thereon, which are [thenames] of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel: 

{21:13} On theeast three gates; on the north three gates; on the south three gates;and on the west three gates. 

{21:14} And the wall of the city hadtwelve foundations, and in them the names of the twelve apostles of theLamb. 

{21:15} And he that talked with me had a golden reed to measurethe city, and the gates thereof, and the wall thereof. 

{21:16} And thecity lieth foursquare, and the length is as large as the breadth: andhe measured the city with the reed, twelve thousand furlongs. Thelength and the breadth and the height of it are equal. 

{21:17} And hemeasured the wall thereof, an hundred [and] forty [and] four cubits,[according to] the measure of a man, that is, of the angel. 

{21:18} Andthe building of the wall of it was [of] jasper: and the city [was] puregold, like unto clear glass. 

{21:19} And the foundations of the wall ofthe city [were] garnished with all manner of precious stones. The firstfoundation [was] jasper; the second, sapphire; the third, a chalcedony;the fourth, an emerald; 

{21:20} The fifth, sardonyx; the sixth,sardius; the seventh, chrysolite; the eighth, beryl; the ninth, atopaz; the tenth, a chrysoprasus; the eleventh, a jacinth; the twelfth,an amethyst. 

{21:21} And the twelve gates [were] twelve pearls; everyseveral gate was of one pearl: and the street of the city [was] puregold, as it were transparent glass. 

{21:22} And I saw no templetherein: for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are the temple of it.

{21:23} And the city had no need of the sun, neither of the moon, toshine in it: for the glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb [is] thelight thereof. 

{21:24} And the nations of them which are saved shallwalk in the light of it: and the kings of the earth do bring theirglory and honour into it. 

{21:25} And the gates of it shall not be shutat all by day: for there shall be no night there. 

{21:26} And theyshall bring the glory and honour of the nations into it. 

{21:27} Andthere shall in no wise enter into it any thing that defileth, neither[whatsoever] worketh abomination, or [maketh] a lie: but they which arewritten in the Lamb's book of life.   

{22:1} And he shewed me a pure river of water of life, clear ascrystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb. 

{22:2} Inthe midst of the street of it, and on either side of the river, [wasthere] the tree of life, which bare twelve [manner] of fruits, [and]yielded her fruit every month: and the leaves of the tree [were] forthe healing of the nations. 

{22:3} And there shall be no more curse:but the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it; and his servantsshall serve him: 

{22:4} And they shall see his face; and his name[shall be] in their foreheads. 

{22:5} And there shall be no nightthere; and they need no candle, neither light of the sun; for the LordGod giveth them light: and they shall reign for ever and ever.   

{22:6} And he said unto me, These sayings [are] faithful and true:and the Lord God of the holy prophets sent his angel to shew unto hisservants the things which must shortly be done. 

{22:7} Behold, I comequickly: blessed is he that keepeth the sayings of the prophecy of thisbook. 

{22:8} And I John saw these things, and heard [them.] And when Ihad heard and seen, I fell down to worship before the feet of the angelwhich shewed me these things. 

{22:9} Then saith he unto me, See [thoudo it] not: for I am thy fellowservant, and of thy brethren theprophets, and of them which keep the sayings of this book: worship God.

{22:10} And he saith unto me, Seal not the sayings of the prophecy ofthis book: for the time is at hand. 

{22:11} He that is unjust, let himbe unjust still: and he which is filthy, let him be filthy still: andhe that is righteous, let him be righteous still: and he that is holy,let him be holy still. 

{22:12} And, behold, I come quickly; and myreward [is] with me, to give every man according as his work shall be.

{22:13} I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, the first andthe last. 

{22:14} Blessed [are] they that do his commandments, thatthey may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through thegates into the city. 

{22:15} For without [are] dogs, and sorcerers, andwhoremongers, and murderers, and idolaters, and whosoever loveth andmaketh a lie.   

{22:16} I Jesus have sent mine angel to testify unto you thesethings in the churches. I am the root and the offspring of David, [and]the bright and morning star.   

{22:17} And the Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him thatheareth say, Come. And let him that is athirst come. And whosoeverwill, let him take the water of life freely.   

{22:18} For I testify unto every man that heareth the words of theprophecy of this book, If any man shall add unto these things, Godshall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book: 

{22:19}And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of thisprophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life, and outof the holy city, and [from] the things which are written in this book.   

{22:20} He which testifieth these things saith, Surely I comequickly. Amen. Even so, come, Lord Jesus.   

{22:21} The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ [be] with you all. Amen.
